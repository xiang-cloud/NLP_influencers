fooled when in amsterdam you see coffee shop and you think amazing i've been looking for the perfect spot for my morning cup you walk in and they say what kind of marijuana do you want coffee shops in amsterdam are for weed cafes are for coffee don't get it twisted because you might end up eating a chocolate croissant that sends you into another dimension be careful [Applause] [Music] check it [Music] boom we can't even take a bite out of it until the coffee comes you know what i mean like that's you cannot that's wrong oh my god thank you there you go thank you so much would you like some sugar or some honey or something just this is perfect oh yeah that is good so listen here's the situation last night i don't know how to put it but i had a lot of wine you know what i mean woke up at two in the morning really not feeling so good okay i get up and i go into the bathroom and i feel something weird happening anyway i get up from the toilet it's a crime scene you ladies know what i'm talking about at this point it's two in the morning i'm a little drunky wonky so i'm like you know what i'm just gonna go back to bed and handle this problem tomorrow this morning i call the front desk and say hey do you guys have a tampon by chance they send up this i don't know how to use this turns out there's just no applicator you just you know so tampons can be found at most supermarkets and drugstores although they're typically just loose tampons what's a loose tampon [Music] so [Music] getting super i guess i'll get normal oh there's other brands i want that one 32 tampons what oh i thought it said added harmful substances in chlorine bleaching and perfume and i was like why why and then it says no so it's actually good but i was like why would they like openly admit on the front that there is bleach in the tampon like that [Music] i'm seriously gonna piss my pants and like i need to i need to try out my new my new um with silk touch cover first that's really kind of i don't know i don't know if i needed to read that my ultimate i need to try whatever so [Music] okay we have to figure out a situation i have never in my life been able to travel with just a carry-on this is all i brought right [Music] i was determined to make this work [Music] it's not working for me so i'm gonna start shipping stuff home i keep going into vintage stores and seeing things that i like and having to say i don't have space for that and i can't live like this anymore i have worn these dickies they they smell like the mcdonald's drive through you know what i mean and i've even washed them but i've worn them so much that like they just need to go home like this shirt i'm over it it can go it can go away these i've worn too many times these shorts super cute can't wear them again i would wear them again if i didn't rip them but i ripped them right here because i wore them so much these need to go home because they're unreliable these need to be washed i have this black skirt i don't know it's just it's wrinkling i need it i need to send it home i don't even want to ship this home because i'm scared that they're going to lose it and this is like one of my favorite sleep shirts i have two sleep shirts that i wear consistently it's this one and i have one that's a paul mccartney shirt and i wear those two to bed exclusively and you can tell because the neck is all stretched out i might do something crazy and ship home this blue sweater because i've been wearing it every single day so i think i'm gonna ship it home and that's a risk i'm also gonna ship home this because i've worn this shirt way too much we'll ship her home too [Music] um [Music] who left my granola open is it stale it's [ __ ] stale now i left it open i'll still eat it but now it's stale so that's a bummer that [ __ ] sucks my reward for shipping all my stuff back is that if i can successfully figure out how to ship it all back i then am allowed to go shopping and if i can't then i'm not allowed to go shopping so it's like i get a little reward if i can figure out how to get this back to america safely ah it's not too bad guess who gets to go shopping me i get to go shopping because i successfully shipped half of my [ __ ] back to america it is time to party and i bought scissors why did i need these i'll remember when i need them again can i even travel with scissors like is that legal i'll google it but i need it i needed a pair of scissors what the [ __ ] did i need scissors for i like it's been bugging me and i've been like looking for them but now i like can't even remember why i needed them so i mean but i have them now can you put scissors in your carry-on here's what i found [Music] so [Music] i got i got little chocolate get little chocolate presents let's go eat them let's go eat them on the jail oh my god they always say that like american chocolate is so bad i just gleeked everywhere because it's so good i do want to get a pair of sunglasses though just has to be the right man [Music] these are so amazing so like there's jeggings like jean leggings these are like dress pant leggings deggings so beautiful but no see i only really i still don't have a lot of space in my suitcase so i can't go buying everything like i still need to be intentional with my choices but okay these are what the hell is going on here actually these are kind of amazing but what is going on oh those are so nice jean paul gautier i feel like that was actually pretty good you know the way to check if they fit go like this with the pants put it around your neck oh wait these actually might fit they don't fit look how cute if i just tailored them a little bit is it worth it to get them tailored because they're really good you know what i'm gonna leave them for somebody who like fits them perfectly like it's like they're a perfect fit or maybe i'll get them i don't know i don't know oh watch him just go like and like bite me could happen [Music] uh [Music] i think it's time for cheese oh my god the cheese and the chocolate here are seriously built different like i i know it's like shut the [ __ ] up but like that was an extraordinary bite it's like an aged gouda but not too aged i personally like my cheese so aged that it's like crumbling apart it's almost too flavorful to a point where like do you want to buy a whole chunk of that i don't know this is a little bit more mild a little bit less aged a little bit less old and stinky so it's better for like casual eating are you kidding me oh my god i can't even eat it now [Music] that's that's pretty cool [Music] i have to go in i don't know why but i do i like need to find the perfect pair for me it's definitely not these are you kidding me those are so flipping cute maybe these are a contender i used to wear those every day i had those wait do they have squirrel ones for my mom when would that ever apply to actually anything no coffee no workie it's kind of hard to make a choice because like there's a lot of choices and like is that a [ __ ] pigeon okay this is the one do they have any more pigeon ones i think that might be asking for too much this is great this is perfect should i get a b one to honor our friend from earlier okay is it bad to get both this is for casual days off this is for like seriously important days in the office you know what i mean [Music] we have to do a haul [Music] [Music] i have to do the photo booth glasses on or off i think off nobody can watch me pose for a photo that's like rule number one i need to lick my lips first because if i don't then it looks like i don't have any i don't know what face to do i don't know i don't feel good about it [Music] it's actually pretty good but that was like a one-hit wonder like i know if i were to go in there again and try to like do it again it wouldn't be good like it's that was a one-hit wonder and i'm just gonna let it be [Music] uh

a different table i think the cool thing about the breakfast buffets at hotels in different cities is that because they're choosing the food arrangement for you it kind of forces you to try new things they do also have a cocktail a morning cocktail set up so you can make a little morning cocktail but see i'm not going that way this trip i don't know so when i'm traveling i want to be living in the moment if i'm having too many drinks i just like did i even go [Music] [Music] [Applause] i am going to get hit by a bike before i leave and i've been hit by a bike before i was at a birthday party me

very tangy and fruity medium roast it's just [ __ ] medium dark roast is like burnt toast so this is a light roast it's fruity [Applause] um see that's the equivalent of like the la tour bus when i see people in los angeles on a tour bus i'm like what are you guys trying to see the tour bus guys like over there we have it's a tick tocker that would be a fun thing to grow why is no one doing that i'm like super into gardening recently like i i grow basil it's so nice like you know like having plants little plants like i want to make a pesto go out in my backyard with my little basket uh like pick my basil i'm gonna grow a chili plant when i get home see when i like order a vodka soda i want half of this in my drink and you know what i get a sliver i want this whole thing in my drink wake up [Music] i found copenhagen deodorant oh it doesn't smell like anything it actually kind of smells it might actually smell worse than my sweat no i mean it smells like baby baby powder i only packed a carry-on so i had to bring a travel size deodorant only and i ran out in like two days because i'm a stinky girl so [Music] wow this is like a pancake with strawberries and some sort of mascarpone that's ridonkulous tastes like a strawberry shortcake that's not dry it's so good um what's copenhagen known for really good architecture or not architecture but really good furniture all the furniture here is super like trendy but it's not even trendy because like they were the one that made the trend you know what i mean copenhagen is also known for the bike riding but i refuse to do the bike riding i really don't like it like everybody here that's riding a bike around you know they know what they're doing i don't know what i'm doing i'm a liability when i'm on a bike here oh no [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] cucumber gin and tonic he almost didn't sell it to me because he didn't think i was over 18. i'm trying to teach myself to like jane so i'm like i'm like micro dosing drinks with gin [Music] raspberry blueberry honestly wait mini carrot [Music] it's getting serious festival mix like what does this taste like i'm honestly oh barbecue got it [Music] [Music]

this way where are we going what the [ __ ] is happening they just let you rent one of these boats without a boating license here do you seem like a good guy all right take our boat out 50 bucks i do love boat life bringing food onto the boat bringing a drink onto the boat having a picnic on the boat having a cheese board on the boat oh it's [ __ ] lit let's pull over you you guys got room for one more i'm kidding i don't know how to park this thing but i'll see you guys you guys going late [Music] why are we turning this way i don't know but why now we're doing it we're doing donuts why are people not doing boat donuts that's way cooler and safer too [Music] need to slow down need to speed up come on this thing sucks sorry sorry see i prefer this over like renting a jet ski because you can actually hang out and see what's going on whereas when you're on a jet ski that beeping sound is killing me we're going under a bridge and it's kind of narrow it's a little hairy okay that wasn't too bad i always thought yachts are super dumb and i just thought they were stupid but then i see one like that and i'm like that's pretty nice i just got my little boat it's cool it's cool the one sea animal that i was obsessed with as a kid was giant squid i wanted to see a giant squid at an aquarium oh [ __ ] you know what was the the worst thing that happened to me in my childhood okay maybe not the worst but maybe like the fifth worst animal planet the television network released a documentary about mermaids my cousins and i watch this and are like holy crap i didn't say bad words back then so i said holy crap there's mermaids later i find out that it was a faux documentary it was a fake documentary by and by animal planet like animal planet is supposed to make factual work about animals and they release a fake documentary about mermaids that of course all the children are believing so i believe that there was mermaids for like years and would like tell people i'm like you haven't seen the documentary you cannot make a fake documentary that is like evil there's like serious psychological trust issues damage there in documentary format it's actually like borderline it's it's sinister and evil now i grew up and i watched documentaries and i'm like is this just another animal planet is this animal planet mermaids round two i don't know you know i'm watching a documentary about something and then i want to go regurgitate the facts later and i'm like i might end up looking like a fool if this is another animal planet mermaids round two should i stand up because that makes me look cooler hey actually i feel like you can control it easier and you look cooler when you're standing oh [ __ ] [Music] [Music]

actually thought that cheese was chicken at first so it is so good it's like the tortilla is so soft and crispy the cheese is like you know what i mean like it's just like it's not like cheese where it's just like where is it no like the cheese has some body it's [ __ ] amazing and now i'm drunk i actually love a spicy mug it's such a summer vibe this might be my summer drink during the winter

shopping i don't really go shopping i like 260 sample sale i love a good sale i would say keth or zara because i just want it i'll train vintage in brooklyn concrete jungle it's like a branch off of alerts urban jungle or whatever but it's like it's cheaper than l train honestly i stumbled up on darpanet like literally just walked in saw the cutest clothes just go in and you'll see the cutest things ever super cute and unique stuff [Music] how cute are these pants stuff like that makes me totally lose my mind like i love stuff like that this is really beautiful [Music] gorgeous wait i love

um can i ask you what your favorite spot to hang out is in new york besides the park we're in right now i cannot include the park okay you can include the park okay the park so you love washington square park the most yes but i don't come here as often as my favorite place being the subway i feel like a lot of people have unfavorable things to say about the subway i don't know why they say that it's a rare opportunity for various people of new york to be together to share the space with other new yorkers to be involved in this very exciting movement by train i love that [Applause] [Music] you know i would love to take a ride i really would i think it would be a really good experience um but i just love walking also i was born in 2001 and i don't know how to read a map i just don't feel confident i would rather walk or just not go than to go on the subway i just i know i would get lost i have a phobia of stepping onto the subway and accidentally falling underneath it's nothing against subways it's just my own personal mental block what do you guys think is the most overrated place in new york i would say times square i see i don't live here so i find it really exciting to be in times square but yes michelle i don't like it and i take my mom there and she hated it too it's fun like once and then you never want to go to town like once i've been there once i'm like i'm good [Music] let's just get this over with [Music] what the [ __ ] i hating here so much no this is my least favorite area in new york there's so much going on and nothing going on at once like i hate hate hate times square this is overrated this is terrifying i hate it i need to leave you know i'm gonna buy nuts though first or maybe a pretzel listen it's like i come to times square get a little snack leaf the almonds thank you so much i'm not gonna lie though i have always wanted to try these nuts i mean they're delicious i'm done with times square though i cannot be here i hate it here so much i don't even know why i came i should have known bye bye times square love you loving you what is your favorite coffee shop ooh ralph's i know it's overrated too i mean yeah the vanilla latte gonna say it um what the hell is that place called roasting plant coffee puerto rico over here is really good too i'm not from here i don't really know uh i go to gasoline island i got this from gasoline alley joe coffee i like blank street it's very blank street yeah [Music] it's good it's good because you know what i look for in a cold brew because my recent order when i go out is a cold brew i used to get lattes i'm at a place in my life where that's too much milk a lot of cold brew that you get out is sour i want something nutty so this is really good um nice size that's a great size not too much not too little my favorite thing about the coffee shops in new york is that all of them have this little outdoor seating area like look how cute that is although there's something about almond milk i love getting almond milk it's my milk of choice always since day one since i started drinking coffee it kind of congeals like i don't know if you can see the little white floaties in it it looks like there's just like a bunch of little eye boogers floating around my coffee it's really really unappetizing but it happens to me all the time with almond milk what do you think is the most underrated spot in new york i'm actually here just on a trip i don't even know low-key fresh coast salads way better than sweet green no way yeah my favorite place to go for cookies is chip city oh my favorite thing in new york is chocolate chip cookies and i basically get one every single day yeah i like sort of the chocolate chip cookie aficionado this is a terrible day for my ibs chocolate chip cookie coffee and a burrito like just like sabotaging myself today seriously i feel like i'm really picky about my chocolate chip cookies i like them to be really gooey like borderline like raw honestly this is feeling a little bit crunchy so i'm a little nervous that's a [ __ ] behemoth [Music] [Music] that is the best cookie i've ever eaten in my life with the coffee i mean like it doesn't really look like what i want a chocolate chip cookie to look like because it's kind of it kind of looks dry it is not dry this [ __ ] is so moist not to mention it has height like it has [ __ ] height to it oh my god what do you think is the most overrated spot in new york oh i think this is like a unpopular opinion by jack's wife's frida i mean washington square park is a little overrated also empire state building oops oops somebody had the same [Music] i've actually i've walked by the empire state building i'm not going up inside of it why because i don't think i need to the fact that i don't really know what it's like at the top of the empire state building i love that it keeps it mysterious same thing with the top of the eiffel tower it's nice to just look at these things and be like god what's it like up there the second you go up to the top and you see it the the wonder the mystery is over that is also my excuse so that i don't have to wait in like a two-hour line for a ticket to take the elevator up to the top of the empire state building i'm just all about weighing out the pros and cons of things if i have to wait in a two-hour line i'm just probably not gonna do it there's just like certain deal breakers when it comes to activities for me if it's like a water sport if i have to wear a life jacket i'm not doing the activity jet skiing well number one i have a traumatizing story from jet skiing i got lost in a lake on a jet ski for an hour and had to flag down some family's boat and then make them call my mom that is a true story um so i don't really like jet skis but i also don't like jet skis because you have to wear a life jacket all of your mobility's gone all your freedom's gone it's not even fun anymore and listen i understand it's a safety thing empire state let's pull over i actually don't know what the empire state building is for and i just realized that so i do want to google it almost every floor of the empire state building is devoted to office space how tall is the empire state building 1250 to is that that can't be feet is it miles it can't be miles either doesn't that feel like more than 1200 feet i think that this might be a little bit overrated and i'm saying that without going to the top so if you're mad at me that's totally valid because i haven't even gone to the top should we try to go to the top [Music] that's where that is i see that on like every day and i have no idea where i was i never do stuff like this [Music] that is pretty spectacular i'm gonna say and we're not we're not even at the top okay you ready to go why is it not windy up here all right i'm good i mean this is this is pretty badass you gotta take a pic of it right i wish i knew like what areas i was looking at like i keep trying to guess like i'm like oh no that's definitely midtown i feel like i'm in batman i don't watch movies a lot but i recently watched batman and so [Music] empire state building i would rate the empire state building an 8.5 out of 10. my rating system is very strict so in 8.5 is pretty high [Music] thank you you're welcome what's your favorite spot to hang out in new york i personally like washington square park just because you get to see a lot of people okay it's really close by right by that fountain great vibes we come we just have like our little lunch picnic yesterday i went today at brooklyn bridge it was amazing seaward park i like frostburg park i would say central park central park yeah we're gonna do a picnic there for my apartment okay besides probably like central park central park yes i grew up around there so that's you know amazing that's where i smoke weed for the first time a child [Music] this might be the most i've ever walked in one day [Music] oh my god what a precious dog central park is amazing i would say it's the best park in new york it's super relaxing it has like a sort of serene feeling that some of the other parks in new york don't have it feels like a place you just want to lay down at and read a book and just growing up my dad would always go around and ask people like ask the locals like hey what's a good place to go to dinner hey what's a good place to go get coffee hey you know and i was always like stop dad like that's so embarrassing like that's so embarrassing that's cringe and then i tried it for myself today and i had the best burrito i've ever had i bought some cute new home decor and i ended up in some magical places i also ended up in some [ __ ] awful places but funny enough those were the places that people told me not to go to like it was my fault for going to times square [Music] you

i saw english green peas and i cannot remember the last time i ate a green pea but for some reason they inspired me and recently i've been in a little cooking phase of my life for the first time in my life i actually think that i get it when it comes to cooking like i actually think i get it now i think i understand what the hype is all about i think i get why the grandmas are so into this [ __ ] you know what i mean i think i understand why people enjoy cooking and i've tried to enjoy it in the past and i've always found it far too tedious and really not that rewarding if i'm being honest i always found that going to a restaurant was more rewarding and although i still love going to a restaurant don't get me wrong love it love it love it one of my favorite things to do in my free time i finally think i understand what the hype is when it comes to cooking i think i get it and it's a hobby for me that's sticking and kind of getting me up in the morning if i'm being honest like the thought of waking up in the morning and cooking excites me and that is priceless anyway back to the green peas i saw these green peas in the grocery store and i had a vision and my vision was a soup with a basil broth and whole green peas and whole potato not whole potatoes not like a whole potato but like pieces of potato and i was like a recipe for this must exist i can't have just come up with this off the dome like i must have seen this before you know this must be a recipe that has been circulated through the internet or something like i doubt that i just spontaneously developed this in my brain so anyway i bought all of the ingredients that i thought that i could need and i came home and started researching basil potato pea soups and to my surprise nothing was coming up that matched what i was envisioning in my head but i was so determined to make this soup in the way that i was picturing it in my head that i decided that i needed to just do some research and figure out how i could make it without following a recipe from somebody who actually knows what the [ __ ] they're doing because i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm doing when it comes to cooking i still do not know how to properly dice an onion etc etc so i did a lot of research i probably spent an hour researching okay you know how long do i need to cook potatoes before i put them in the soup do i cook them in the soup from start to finish or do i boil the potatoes before i put them in the soup like what the [ __ ] going on here how do i do this so that i don't fail and hate myself because there's nothing i hate more than wasting food and if i make food that tastes really bad and is inedible inedible and inedible then i get really angry at myself because i hate wasting food and i think it's a terrible thing to do and i avoid it at all costs and that means that i actually do frequently eat foods that are burnt and or cooked improperly in order to not waste them and that has caused me stomach pain etc anyway after all my research i wrote out a pretty basic plan as to how i was going to make this soup so the first thing i decided to do was to boil some peas and boil some potatoes and based on my research i found that boiling peas only takes about a minute or two and boiling potatoes only takes about 15 to 20 minutes so i boiled those for around that amount of time did i set a timer sure i did but the timer went off and then i stopped it and then i forgot to take things off the heat who knows how long i boiled them next i did some chopping um of shallot and my shallots looked a little bit funky i honestly thought that they were a little bit moldy so i kept smelling them to make sure that they weren't moldy i don't really know what this unknown gray substance is that's around the shallot but it was the only shallot i had so i kind of had to make do with what i had after chopping these terribly i threw them into a large pot over medium-low heat something that i'm just now learning when it comes to cooking is the importance of cooking on a lower heat like i used to think that i just needed to cook everything on high heat and like that was my path to success but i'm learning that cooking things low and slow is really effective being patient you know yes it might be tempting to turn your heat up all the way when you're cooking something but that's not good it's not good you don't have as much control and it's just a mess i finally learned how to cook eggs properly i used to cook my eggs on high heat and just now recently i learned how to make perfect scrambled eggs in a perfect fried egg not burnt even though i don't really mind the flavor of a burnt egg i don't but cooking things on a lower temperature is really important anyway so i cooked the shallot over medium low heat and then i added some garlic for the last say two minutes of cooking that shallot all of that went well my kitchen started to smell very fragrant which was exciting my hands reeked of garlic and shallot which used to really bug me like it used to make me not want to cook with onion garlic shallot because i was so annoyed with how my hands would smell but now i'm learning to kind of appreciate when my hands smell like food you know what i mean this might be kind of disgusting but it's like it's not like it's a bad smell like it's yummy like you know like i don't know and before you go and call me a freak you love onion and garlic yes i'm talking to you you love onion and garlic you might not even know that you love it but when you go to your favorite restaurant i can guarantee the best tasting dish on the table probably has a [ __ ] ton of onion and garlic in it even though the smell is a little weird it's still yummy and sometimes i itch my armpit and cut a shallot within the same hour and when i smell my hand later i don't know i don't know if the rancid smell came from me itching my armpit or from the shallot um anyway so after that i added six cups of water i added in a teaspoon of salt and a half teaspoon of pepper i added about three tablespoons of this vegetable boyon which was kind of intimidating to me because buying a pre-made boyon which is basically all of the delicious flavors of a stock packed into a paste so that you can mix it into water and then it flavors the water for soup okay like buying a pre-made one is kind of scary right because you don't really know what you're getting yourself into the flavor is kind of unpredictable especially if you haven't tried that specific boy on before and i've never used boy on before to be honest i've never even made a soup i've made a curry before but i've never made a soup so this whole experience was really scary i was kind of shooting in the dark here i was like i don't know what i'm getting myself into and then things kind of started to get intense because this next step is kind of when my soup was about to turn into what i had dreamed it to be it was like all the dirty work was done and it it was almost time to assemble so i removed the pan from the heat put it into a blender and added a half a cup of basil and a fourth cup of parmesan i probably could add more parmesan honestly i'm going through a cheese phase recently i went a pretty long time without eating much cheese because i thought that it hurt my stomach but it turns out it doesn't and that was some of the best news i've gotten in a long time cheese doesn't hurt my stomach now let me tell you if i drink a glass of milk it's a completely different story but cheese for whatever reason doesn't bug me and there is science behind it and i have done the research but i don't think anyone cares so anyway i threw everything into the blender except for my peas and my potatoes and i blended that mixture up and at first i was really worried i will say i was concerned because in my brain i had imagined a vibrant green broth for my soup but the vegetable boy on that i added into the soup base just turned it kind of brown and after blending in the basil it was a little bit more green but it wasn't as green as i imagined so at this point i was praying for a miracle because seeing this brown soup base kind of upset me you know it was like wow my dream is not coming together as i planned but i didn't give up and when i tried the soup base i was shocked at how delicious it was it was so flavorful and i was really excited this kind of put the pep back into my step i was like you know what maybe maybe shit's not so bad after all maybe everything will be okay but i didn't know for sure yet i had a very strong fear that i didn't cook my peas and my potatoes correctly i was very very very very very very very very very very very very concerned about this but you know the show must go on so i added the peas and the potato to the mixture and i brought it up to a boil one last time and that was the end of the soup the soup was done [Music] [Music] i garnished my soup with some parmesan cheese because again i'm going through a cheese phase right now i can't stop putting cheese on literally [ __ ] everything i'm serious i also garnished my soup with a bit of chives i love the way that chives look i just think that they're so beautiful when they're finely chopped they're like little tiny circle green circles and i just think that they look great i don't say this a lot but i'm [ __ ] proud of myself and i'm proud of this [ __ ] soup and the way that i rate a cooking success is based on whether or not i would purchase it at a restaurant and for how much money i would purchase it for at a restaurant and with this soup i would definitely purchase it at a restaurant and i would pay 17 for it [Music] so [Music] you

capsule because it really hasn't been touched ever like it's it has not been changed in any way since i was a kid and there is some weird [ __ ] in here like there's just some weird [ __ ] in here and every time i come home like i find new stuff every single time i can go on like a treasure hunt in here and i'll always find something new and something weird and something i didn't find the last time the only thing that's different about it is that my dad decided to put all of his musical equipment in my room and so now it kind of looks like a recording studio mixed with my childhood bedroom but it's still my childhood bedroom [Music] oh is this kindergarten oh my god that was me in kindergarten the haircut was kind of good like i would get that haircut again kind of makes me want to get that haircut now you know like if it worked for her then why wouldn't it work for for me now it's the same me yeah holy [ __ ] these books were so good i would literally buy one of these from a bookstore and read the whole thing in like two days and they were so good i think i'm gonna read this again like hopefully i'm not too old to read it you know when you like go back and you look at something again that you used to love when you were a kid and it's just like not the same now that you're older like that might happen with this book but i'm gonna give it a try i might read it later i remember getting these with my mom for back to school and so my mom and i went to go get me you know new shoes for the school year and i remember i picked these out and i remember i got home and i forced my mom to let me put them on and i just ran around the house for like two hours in these and i thought that they were the sickest [ __ ] shoes i'd ever seen in my life unfortunately they are hideous i had no idea i mean again i was seven so like although if valencia came out with shoes it was just like this everybody would buy them so what does that say about society you know oh this has milk stains all over it those are milk stains i remember i used to wear this every morning and then i would watch napoleon dynamite on the tv and eat my breakfast and my breakfast was usually some sort of cereal with milk and this thing has [ __ ] milk all over it still okay thank god why did i smell it i was obsessed with the idea of remote control powered toys as a kid like i thought that was most genius concept and the most exciting concept of all time it really never even knew how it couldn't even fly these remote control toys for kids never actually work and it's so such a heartbreaking thing for a kid to go through this is a school art project i say on here that i'm thankful for my teacher which is exactly like that is how you know i was teacher's pet because i really didn't need to do that but i was like maybe i'll get a little extra love from the teacher if i give her a little shout out on my art project that is manipulation and the fact that i was manipulating that young personally worries me oh my god i don't know where my dad and i got this because neither of us wanted to eat it it just like sat on our kitchen counter for literally six months and then we started pranking each other with it so like i'd put it under his pillow he would put it on the back of the toilet seat you know goofy [ __ ] like that there's this thing called needle felting where basically you take wool yarn almost and you poke it with a needle over and over again and then it starts to stick together and create a like a little stuffed animal and so my mom and i got super into this for probably a month and then we never did it again i actually made this little bunny and honestly super cute i remember the process of creating these little things it was so time consuming and you'd accidentally poke yourself in the hand with a needle and it was like it was really it could get potentially frustrating which is why i quit making them see authentic hello kitty earring literally i could go on depop and sell this for like 80 now i won't they're kind of they're kind of they're kind of good wait there's no way there's a [ __ ] blockbuster coupon in here valid from may 1st to june 15th 2004. what the [ __ ] also why is this in my room in 2004 i was three years old like this wouldn't have been of use to me i don't think i knew how to use a coupon when i was that age no not the [ __ ] victoria's secret pink sweet and flirty body mist that actually smells [ __ ] terrible oh my god it literally it just made me get like a minor eyebrow headache yeah that's pretty awful i thought i was such a baddie i would wear these to my little middle school dances i thought that like really truly boys were gonna finally like me if i wore these it might have been repelling them it reminds me of things i just don't want to think about ever again you know this is like the type of thing i would beg my parents to buy me i would be like you guys no you guys don't get it this is like going to change my life and then they'd be like no it won't so like for most kids you know they like play with the toy for a week and then they get bored of it like for me i probably was carrying this thing around for like six months and like never got sick of it and that's what that's why i'm different from other kids and i'm not like other kids stop it if these earrings ever come back which just i feel like they will because everything comes back like i already have a stash i have every color i have a hard time believing that these were ever really actually cute oh no [Music] this is like all i knew how to paint so i just have like all these all these paintings of these weird triangle characters like couldn't i have done like a square creature like why did they all have to be triangles i don't understand it's fine but oh was i trying to design clothes i don't know how old i was when i drew this based on the handwriting i must have been like 14. if i were to show this to somebody who sews clothes they would be like babe there's nothing there you didn't give us anything if you want this money you can have it thank you for writing i do know how to make fairy homes if you want me to i can and since you are a since you are a fairy can i grant some wishes please write dak listen like i i i need to explain a little bit i used to be obsessed with fairies and i thought that fairies were real and i wanted to be a fairy and i wanted to meet fairies and so i'd make fairy houses in my backyard and you know things like that so that fairies could move in and i'd write them little letters and that was that situation um hi fairy i'm not a very good seller but just writing to say hello from emma to fairy please write back please i mean no all about me name emma chamberlain hair color caramel come on what does that even mean occupations cello and needle felting i played the cello no listen this is complete [ __ ] i played the cello for literally six months in middle school and on this all about me school project i decided that it would be appropriate to say that my occupation was playing cello as if i knew anything about the cello like i took orchestra class in middle school but i didn't actually like know how to play the cello like i didn't know what is going on what is that i didn't know how to play the cello i was like faking it like when we would do performances for our families and stuff like i would just pretend like i was playing the cello i wasn't even actually playing it needle felting on the other hand i mean i showed you earlier like i was definitely doing that you know for like a month favorite food pasta true favorite band the shins and the beatles okay favorite book dear dumb diary wait i wonder if i can find that this was my absolute favorite book it was so edgy it's like journal entries i mean they're not real fake journal entries from this girl and they're all funny and i i mean this book was genuinely this book shaped who i am today no oh my god this might seem insignificant to some but these tank tops with the built-in training bra my god when i bought one of these i was like yes i am a woman maybe maybe i'm losing my mind you know stuff like this it is like an artifact like it should go in a museum and like this tiny little iphone 4 case i mean like this stuff deserves to go in a museum like this stuff is rare i sewed this myself like cute like it's cute i had this phase where i would just wear old navy fleece pajamas everywhere i would wear them to the mall i would wear them to the grocery store i would have worn them to school if it wasn't against dress code you can get away with it when you're 11 but when you're older it's just not good anymore um oh my god should i use it this is literally 10 years old how does it still work am i do i need to call poison control i probably shouldn't use that these were all the rage all the girlies would be fighting each other over who had the most flavors of these eos lip balms it was like not good for the for the community like people and like they were like selling out at stores everybody's fighting over these it was really it really caused some violence these things i mean you can just tell that these haven't been touched in you know 12 years like they just you can tell they just have that look like you know when you go into your grandma's nail polish drawer and you pull out a nail polish and it just looks like this because it's just been sitting there untouched for 10 years longer 20 years [ __ ] it what else is in here i mean it's like i swear to god it's never ending you guys oh [ __ ] i just stepped on an outlet i just found a good ass hat wait this is cute i hated hats growing up so like this one just got shoved in that drawer over there this is such a good this is such a good hat i feel like i just won the lottery see look i'm this is like productive me digging through my room is productive i swear i feel so bad for my parents because i used to make them take me to like those places where you can paint pottery all the time just for me to be this bad at painting pottery like i had zero artistic ability and i just feel bad for them you know the amount of money they spent and like this is what their daughter made you know and i mean they're good sports but it's just look at my fancy little easter dress i even had a purse wait what does an 11 year old keep in their purse let's find out tic tacs that expire in 2010. okay so these so definitely won't be eating these although part of me kind of wants to eat one just see what like what would happen yeah i don't want to do that actually everybody's mom made their halloween costumes for them growing up i feel like this was one of my mom's it's honestly [ __ ] great i was the corpse bride and it's like this white dress that has dirt all over it fraying you know lace and stuff she killed it this is gorge i wish i could say that like i was some sort of

I should not be wearing this it's like a puffer jacket but soft okay like that is a mom thing listen I know it's like why live life by the rules I agree I'm on the same page but there's something disturbing about the fact that I think it's okay to wear these mom-inspired puffer jackets every day I have two colors and I wear them every day if I'm not wearing the gray one I'm wearing the green one you know what I mean like that's kind of my routine right now that's scary to me do I have anywhere to go no no I don't need to run any errands I don't need to leave the house but I am deciding right now that I'm leaving the house and I am deciding that I am going to do something I don't know what it is yet um listen like there's always an errand to run like there's always some sort of errand that you need to run not a day goes by where there isn't at least one errand that could be run I just need to think about what that is oh you know what I need to get gas actually I only have half a tank left is that more than enough it is more than enough but I'm gonna get gas and then after that the world's my oyster I put on UGG boots this morning I mean business you know I don't whip the Ugg boots out when I'm just like coasting I put the Ugg boots on when I'm going sport mode you know it's not this is not a joke all right now what I got a full tank too so it's like what are we doing what are we doing what are we doing you know what I mean the thing is do I really need to be here no but I just remembered that I ran out of white distilled vinegar so you know it's like I like using white distilled vinegar to make pickled carrots um I make pickled carrots probably once every three days that is not a joke I put pickled carrots on everything what would happen if I went to go make my pickled carrots and I didn't have any white distilled vinegar chaos chaos would happen so anyway this is God look how Los Angeles this is right now with this palm tree hasta la vista what does that mean [Music] I found this um pumpkin spice creamer and so I'm gonna add this to my coffee and see if it's any good smells good tastes pretty good on its own it's pretty good actually seriously seriously fall Vibes right now with my pumpkin spice creamer so that's so [ __ ] cute of me oh my God it just all hit me that I'm literally drinking a pumpkin spice cold brew and I'm wearing [ __ ] leggings and Ugg boots like I accidentally just became I'm turning into something that I'm I never thought I would turn into what is happening to my identity right now I feel unsafe [Music] thank you [Music] foreign oh that was too much I've had the same cans of pumpkin for as long as I can remember like I'm not kidding I had the same cans of pumpkin for probably three years and I've never used them and Halloween's coming fine I'll make a pumpkin dessert fine the crazy thing is I've been wearing these blue shorts for like a month straight I will find like a pajama item and I will just like grow an emotional attachment to it and then I'll just wear it for like six months straight and then I get sick of it and then I find a new thing does anyone actually like pumpkin or do we just like pumpkin spice I think we just like pumpkin spice if somebody were to give you this and say hey sweetheart eat this with a spoon none of us would do it we all like pumpkin spice flavored things okay let's not kid ourselves here none of us actually like pumpkin I'm gonna eat a little bit of this right now just to prove a point it tastes like nothing it's not good do it that way you want but it's like the afternoon time it's like 3 P.M and this is when I start to get grumpy like in the morning I'm in a good mood I wake up in the morning I feel amazing happy positive insightful wise excited exhilarated and then it's like 3 P.M hits and I am in such a bad mood every day and I cannot put a finger on why that is [Applause] I decided to make almond butter pumpkin chocolate chip blondies whatever the [ __ ] that means oh my God it [ __ ] smells amazing very aromatic I'm sorry we have to try a little bit yes yes wow yes I saw something um it doesn't say to do this in the recipe but I saw something in a cooking video where you take your chocolate chips and you coat them in flour it helps the chocolate chips not all stick to the bottom is this true I know it is sometimes but I don't know if it's true for me [Music] so good oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] happy Halloween that is good all right God damn it why do I keep licking things I'm not sure if this tin was a good fit I mean they said it is I don't know what's right I don't know what's right I mean it's fine again this is all about the end result like if it tastes good then we were in a good spot I'm trying to think about how I could like garnish this to make it look really pretty you know what I think it's good the way it is or maybe I do a little bit of brown sugar add a little bit of molasses flavor for that for that holiday baking Flair you know I don't know if that's going to do anything it might make it too sweet at this point I just have to let Jesus Take the Wheel foreign skills need some work but [Music]

used to bake when I was younger like when I was like 15 I used to make muffins every week and then I'd eat them throughout the week for breakfast and like that was so cute of me as like a 15 year old I'm so proud of myself for doing that you know like I want to get back into that I want to I went to the farmer's market this morning and I got so much fruit I literally bought forty dollars worth of fruit and I ate all of it today the only stuff I didn't eat this is all I didn't eat so I'm making strawberry muffins I wanted to make blueberry muffins but I ate all of my [ __ ] blueberries 30 minutes after buying them ah you know when you watch videos of people like doing things and then it makes you feel like you can do it too like a good example would be like during the Olympics after like a week of watching the Olympics you start to feel like you could do what they're doing because you've watched them do it so much that like you're like oh I feel like I could do that now that I you know that's how I feel about baking sorry I'm trying to find the umbilical cord of the of the egg it's disgusting but like I refuse to have that in my muffins so excuse me as I pull it out thank you I don't really need to do that either like it's kind of unnecessary but I just feel better when it's not in there so all right to be honest I don't think I've ever even had a strawberry muffin I can't imagine it would be bad [Music] oh my God that tastes delicious I've grown this obsession with this Chef her name is Claire I am obsessed with her she is the best person on the planet literally all I do in my free time is lay in bed and watch Claire bake things that's all I do I want her to officiate my wedding I want her to I'm obsessed with her the strawberries look good I'm happy with it I don't really know what I'm what my goals that's fine God the dough is so thick holy [ __ ] it's so thick it's moments like this when I don't know what to do like I can't really need it okay like does it need more oil like I can't add water I don't think like that's not good I don't I've never seen what would Claire do honestly what would Claire do I feel like she'd add oil or milk oh my god did I not put the milk in that's what I forgot to put the milk in this is chaos I just know that this isn't right I think it's actually fine [Music] foreign [Music] foreign but it's not bad I think it would have been better with blueberries I think the strawberries are just like not they're just not flavorful enough but they're pretty good I'm gonna make these again with blueberries and I think they'll be really good they're very moist which is nice they're not dry they're dense which I like I like a dense muffin I think they're also lacking some sweetness like I think they could be a little sweeter I'll tweak the recipe I'll add blueberries they'll be good next time foreign [Applause] I finally got my espresso machine in the mail after a year in two months I have been waiting for this thing for it feels like my whole life I'm honestly so relieved what [Music] hi do you want to come sit with me okay I'm just thrilled it was so hard for me to not have an espresso machine for a year and a half I've been drinking cold brew for like a year straight um a year and a half straight exactly a year and two months straight this drink might look a little bit weird to you because number one there's not much of it and number two it's warm and I normally don't drink warm drinks but this is a cortado and I've recently really grown to love cortados they're basically like a latte but with less milk I think they're [ __ ] amazing the other thing I like about them is that I can drink them in a short period of time and so the entire time that I'm drinking the cortado the temperature is ideal whereas when you get a hot latte the first few sips are too hot and then you have like a two minute window where things are tasting great the temperature is on point everything is in a good spot and then it gets too cold and then you still have like half of a latte left and it's too cold and that's just not good you know cortados are supposed to be served in like a tiny little glass but I don't have any of those I ordered them they're coming I can't wait to get them because it's gonna make my coffee experience Next Level it's so foggy and rainy out today that I'm not going outside foreign I decided I needed to go on a walk because if I didn't things were gonna get dark do you know what I mean and one of the things I like about traveling is that I tend to walk around and explore a lot more and I don't really do that when I'm in LA because there's not much to see there's really not a lot going on here this is my favorite neighborhood in LA to walk around because it's all flat and all the houses are gorgeous and for some odd reason nobody's here ever like I I just saw one other person and that was it and I've been walking for like 20 minutes and I have not seen anybody where is everyone it's it's genuinely spooky this neighborhood is so [ __ ] weird but I love it I really love it I would never live in this neighborhood because I just wouldn't but I mean there's something so interesting about it and Eerie about it [Music] all right I have been coming to this target for three years and I still get lost every single time I park in this parking garage it is the absolute worst parking garage on the planet there is not a worse parking garage [Music] foreign [Music] you know I'm kind of taking this cooking thing like seriously here's my here's my thing here's my journey okay I've been like lightly getting into cooking for a few months now but I was like a lazy Chef okay like I would make something and then you know like I'd make pasta and I would use sauce that I bought from the store like I wouldn't make my own sauce so you know technically I was cooking for myself but at the same time I was kind of cheating I've always been a very lazy chef but recently I decided that I you know wanted to get really good at it but I also wanted to make [ __ ] that's like actually restaurant quality and not just like whip something together that's lazy not that there's anything wrong with that I just like I don't know I want to really get good at actually cooking things so I've been experimenting a lot with making homemade sauces I'm cooking some vegetables in one of the sauces I made which is this green tahini sauce and it's [ __ ] insane it's so good I also made this lemon Dijon salad dressing which is very good and I made this tomato basil sauce and I made it completely from scratch I've roasted my own Tomatoes I roasted my own garlic I made my own pesto I blended it all together like I'm trying to get good at this I think that the missing piece for me like up until now was that I didn't make my own sauces making your own sauces is like a game changer so I've been really trying to get good at making sauces I think that what makes a good sauce is a lot of fresh herbs and fresh herbs are kind of annoying to buy but I kid you not they make the best sauces I didn't cook anything interesting today because I just ate leftovers that were in my fridge but like that's fine that's actually kind of one of the good parts about cooking then you have leftovers all the time the real reason why I wanted to get into cooking all of a sudden and like actually get into it not just like is because I've been watching strictly cooking videos in my free time but also instructional videos like yes I watched like fun cooking videos but I also watch instructional cooking videos I've learned a lot sorry I forgot what the recipe is just I want to be a [ __ ] Chef baby I'm not [ __ ] around like I don't want to [ __ ] around see this is a habanero chili and this makes the sauce taste so good but I'm genuinely scared of touching habanero chilies because the oil from them rubs off onto your hands and then burns your eyes if you touch your eyes so I'm really trying not to touch this pepper I will avoid it at all costs ah you know what I'm just gonna have to touch it if I touch my eyeball later I'm gonna be hating my life but I want to cook for somebody like one of my family or friends and I want them to be like Emma how did you make this like that's my goal my goal is like to get to a point where I'm so good that like people who have known me for a long time are like Emma I can't believe you've done this ah oh [ __ ] I did cheese grade my finger the other day so that's what is going on here and now I just got lime juice into it which is probably karma for something ow garlic literally my favorite ingredient to cook with is tahini if you don't know what tahini is it's Blended up sesame seeds I don't know what it is but it's my favorite ingredient to cook with I put it in everything and then if I don't use tahini I'm probably using sesame seeds I'm genuinely excited to have a child one day to make their school lunches my kids are going to have the most badass school lunches of all time I don't know if I've said that before out loud I can't remember I feel like I have said that out loud but it's becoming more true every day otherwise having a kid is super not appealing to me but like actually pushing the kid out of my body not appealing dealing with my child when my child was crying again not that appealing but making my kids really aesthetically pleasing school lunches that will make other moms jealous that is that is appealing all right this sauce is ready to be Blended let's see oh it's the most gorgeous light green color it's so good this is the best sauce I've ever made holy [ __ ] it's so good I would [ __ ] drink this sauce don't do that don't do what I just did oh my God it's so good wow that makes me love myself cooking something that actually tastes good really boosts your confidence don't ask me why it's tahini water habanero pepper salt lime garlic basil mint I think that's it and you just put in a blender and now you have your own sauce that you can put on literally anything and it would make literally anything taste good like you could put this on some gross [ __ ] and it would make it taste good you could put this on chicken livers I would drink this sauce okay that was super exciting there we go I'm trying to think if there's anything else I can cook right now that's what I tend to do I like to cook at night like cook the night before and then I have food for the next day I think I'm good though I have some stuff roasting in the oven foreign not done yet what else could I cook this is why I want kids because it's like I want to cook for more people I don't want to just cook for myself and I feel like kids you know they're easy to cook for they don't care you know you make them homemade mac and cheese you make them box mac and cheese they don't know the difference which is why you know cooking for them is so healing foreign [Music]

been um three weeks i've not been back to la i've been everywhere but la and now we're in boston we're trying something new i haven't been to boston ever actually i have been to boston but i've never spent any period of time here um [Music] i don't know why i just decided to zoom into my receding gums i really hope my dentist isn't watching this cause that's bad oh god that's bad i brush my teeth like i don't know what the [ __ ] i did wrong to deserve that what i'm not gonna lie i really don't like making coffee in a keurig it's possibly one of my least favorite things but i've been up since four in the morning and i don't have energy to go for a walk to find coffee yet so like this is what we're doing you know desperate times call for desperate measures [Music] you guys what am i doing i have not been home in like three weeks now i'm in boston like what am i doing i've never really done this before like i feel like in the past every time i've traveled i've always planned everything out very particularly very um specifically and i've never kind of been random like this but i'm being extremely random i booked a one-way ticket to boston i don't even know when i'm leaving here like i don't know what i'm doing my ears are not fully popped yet so i'm excited to explore the city it's a new city for me my hotel room is cute it's like music themed in here like there's like a record player in my room listen i'm having a good time i'm enjoying myself i'm being a free spirit i'm being extremely random whatever like whatever i'm i'm i don't know i don't know is this like i'm wondering if this is like a cry for help although i don't think so because i'm having a great time i don't think like my impulsive traveling is a sign of something wrong with me i think it's just a phase i don't know i think it's like 10 or 11 in the morning i need a coffee immediately um i need to go to the grocery store to pick up all of my essentials my hotel room essentials before i get dressed i'm going to tell you about the sponsor of today's video which is thredup thank you thread up for sponsoring this video if you haven't heard of thredup thredup is an online thrift store with

and you can get an extra 30 off your first order with code emma [Music] recently i've adopted a new coffee order which has not happened in like five years i've been ordering the same thing for five years i found a new drink that i really like i've been ordering cortados not only does the name cortado sound fancy but it's also like genuinely you know it's genuinely good it's basically a latte like a hot latte but with less milk so it's kind of like a combination between getting a double shot espresso and a hot latte and it's really good and i've been getting them a lot recently and the thing i like about them is that you can drink them really quickly they're delicious they taste good but they're not too milky but they're also not too bitter like just getting espresso cortado check it out nothing better than just sitting in the grass my hair just looks like [ __ ] today first impressions of boston it's very beautiful here there's a lot of nature there's a lot of parks which i really like i'm really getting into parks i've walked past like six parks and i've been here for like four hours that's nice um it's very beautiful there's a lot of pretty brick buildings you know i feel like the energy here is kind of calming and relaxing enjoying that my coffee was really good so that's a good sign what else yeah so far i'd give boston like an 8 out of 10. i don't really know what i'm rating it based on but like i'd give it an 8 out of 10 just generally i would say i'd rate like new york city a nine and a half out of ten on my imaginary scale that has no like basis i don't really know what again i don't know what i'm what the scale is based on i'd give paris a 10 actually paris is a 9.8 out of 10 because i don't know how to speak french i'd give los angeles a 4 out of 10. i hate i hate it i'm giving it a 4 because it's close to the beach and because i live there so if i gave it a 0 out of 10 then that would be bad for my brain uh but yeah boston's at like an eight right now so that's pretty good i like it actually you know it might be out of seven it's very cool but you know i don't really know what to do here like i'm not really sure like what the fun stuff to do is here i know that it's a big sport city i'm staying right by the baseball stadium and it seems like that's a really hot attraction unfortunately i couldn't care less about anything i don't care about sports at all in any way and i never have i'm not going to be attending a sporting game i'm so sorry it's just not in my future in any way shape or form and that seems to be a big like boston activity i didn't do any research because i always hate what the internet tells me to do the internet will be like go on a um go on a boat ride and go whale watching i'm like i would rather actually not do that there's a whole foods nearby might check it out we'll see where the day takes me i don't really have any plans and i don't need to have plans i just want to exist in a new environment simply that's all my goal is today [Music] so [Music] ah i am so excited about this right now i feel like when i'm traveling my brain like works better when i'm at home like my brain is just in autopilot at all times but when i'm traveling my brain is like switched out of autopilot and i feel like i'm more conscious and more aware but when i'm at home i just turn into a robot and i don't like that sensation i'm also so excited about this sushi like i don't know what it is but like sushi sounds so [ __ ] good to me right now i mean it always sounds good to be honest i feel pretty exhausted i might need to take a nap um [Music] it's so [ __ ] good why is it so good um this is hitting this [ __ ] spot this is hitting the spot i'm not gonna lie i don't really want to do anything for the rest of the day but i'm also like all right we need to do the [ __ ] thing like i can't not go out and do stuff i'm here you know i need to seize the day but i'm also like my bed feels really good you know what i mean whole foods you guys know what you're doing such good sushi that sushi is no joke the only problem about eating in bed though is that like i'm constantly spilling [ __ ] in bed it's not good like i shouldn't be eating in bed because like you know now there's soy sauce in my bed it's like a mess but you know i'm the only one sleeping in this bed like it doesn't bother me i know where it came from that is a familiar stain to me that's not like some sort of scary weird stain like i know when that stain happened i know the story behind it i know what it is like it doesn't frighten me it doesn't gross me out it's not harming me conclusion is that eating in bed is fine yeah i'm gonna take a nap it's just like that's just i have to because then i start to get grumpy and then i get upset like i get emotional if i like try to push myself when i'm tired i just end up having like a meltdown and i'm always trying to avoid that so i'm going to take a nap i'm going to force myself to take a nap like how in preschool you know when your preschool teacher would force you to take a nap in the middle of the day and you didn't want to do it but also like deep down you know you knew you were tired was that a useful metaphor [Music] thank you to thread up for sponsoring this video i picked out some of my favorite pieces on thredup's website link is in the description for that and you can get an extra 30 off your first order with code emma check out [Music]

bit sad about it being my last day but i'm also ready by the end of the trip you're always like okay i'm ready to go home although i'm not going home i'm going to new york tomorrow listen i'm just not ready to go back to la yet i'm going to wait until something forces me to go home i have a cat sitter like my cats are fine they're being fed and pet and cuddled every day not by me which is unfortunate but they are being taken care of right now i'm in the mood for a coffee i already had one this morning but i think it's time for another one so i'll start there it's almost like a scavenger hunt it's like okay first up i want to find a coffee shop then i just walk until i find one of those and it's like a scavenger hunt next thing you know you've been out all day and you had a great [ __ ] time also i literally love filming myself in public here because for some reason nobody cares it's really awesome okay never mind somebody just gave me a weird look some man just looked at me like i killed his family so i actually take everything i said back [Music] i have a slight issue i need to go to the bathroom so bad like not even just like oh i have to pee or like oh i have to like maybe go number two like i have to do both like i need to like sit on the toilet for an hour right now but i'm out for the day like i'm not planning on going back to my hotel room for the rest of the day so you know i mean i'll figure it out it's just that [Music] last night my dad and i went to an art museum and it was one of those like famous paris art museums it's called the dorsey it had a bunch of famous paintings in it van gogh paintings monet paintings i think that this museum experience really opened my eyes to the fact that actually museums are kind of fun they're not fun that's not the right word but they're amusing they're like relaxing and amusing like i wasn't like ah [ __ ] yes ah i love this monet painting so much i'm having literally so much fun this is better than coachella you know like it wasn't like that it's a very unique form of entertainment going to a museum is a very different kind of entertainment anyway i took pictures of some of my favorite art pieces that i saw you look at this dude laying in bed and you can like feel what his body feels like right now like he's been snuggled up in bed for a few hours his blankets and sheets are all warmed up he's all insulated in the in the bed and he's all warm you know like that's the vibe like that's the vibe i can like feel this vibe see this is a van gogh painting and the funny thing about van gogh paintings is that obviously they're extremely famous everybody in the museum was like fangirling over the van gogh paintings and it was so interesting to see people like fangirling over an inanimate object but anyway i was also fangirling this is actually my favorite painting of all time i am [ __ ] obsessed with this painting i honestly really want to buy a fake one and just put it up in my house and i know that that's so wrong like i know it's just so [ __ ] good i love all the colors in it i love the wonkiness of the room there's something weirdly nostalgic about it i love how there's paintings of paintings in this on the top right like this is just the [ __ ] this is my favorite painting of all time and i know that i'm not saying anything groundbreaking here i think a lot of people probably love this painting it's very [ __ ] famous painting but whatever i can still appreciate it it's so funny like with art i feel like talking about famous art is like the same thing as talking about popular music it's like not cool to like the popular thing but [ __ ] all that i hate that and i love this painting and i cannot wait to buy a fake one i don't know why i was so obsessed with this portrait van gogh did this portrait of this dude i just love his facial expression he looks a little bit nervous he looks like me anytime i'm at a social event like when i'm at a party this is what my face looks like just a little bit uncomfortable what the [ __ ] another van gogh painting that's just a [ __ ] banger this one is just so good it kind of reminds me of coraline coraline is my favorite movie and this kind of reminds me of the house in coraline i just love everything about that this is the famous van gogh self-portrait i mean i had to [ __ ] take a photo of it he looks great in it the thing i do wonder about self-portraits back in the day is like how did they like how did they do it like did they take like a photo of themselves were there even cameras back then i know there were cameras okay don't get [ __ ] mad at me i play dumb all the time i'm not actually that dumb i play dumb a lot and i am dumb sometimes but i know that there were cameras back then actually i'm not 100 sure there had to have been cameras i know there were cameras anyway um yeah this is just a full painting of a vagina i'd love to say that i'm classy i'd love to say that i can see the beauty in a painting of a vagina i took a selfie in front of it and i sent it 10 people you know what i'm saying like anyway i'm gonna start going to art museums more i really enjoyed that it's relaxing but not boring it's kind of similar to reading a book it's like this very relaxing form of entertainment which i think the older you get the more you appreciate and so you know i might start going to museums more i'm not kidding i've had to go to the bathroom for the past half hour and the problem is it's hard to just find a bathroom like i don't know where to go to find a [ __ ] bathroom like where do i go to find a bathroom i'm in a park right now there's no bathrooms here also if i ask somebody again i'm really bad at languages and listen this is my fault but like you know if i ask somebody where the bathroom is chances are they're going to tell me in french and i'm just going to have to try to decode what they told me and i'll probably find a bathroom somewhere the problem is i don't know how long i can hold it [Music] i found the [ __ ] bathroom in in a mall i think i'm in a mall like a shopping mall i don't know know that bathroom experience i walk into this bathroom and i see a toilet so i start walking towards it and then i get yelled at and i was like what and she was like you have to pay to use the toilet and i was like oh okay that's fine i will pay to use the toilet i can't believe i have to pay to poop never thought that that would happen but hey sure whatever i pay this woman i get in line i mean like i was in so i was so uncomfortable like i was past the point of no return like it wasn't like oh i have to pee a little bit i have to poop a little bit it was like oh no i'm actually about to [ __ ] and piss myself at the same time my abdomen felt like felt like it had rats inside of it just eating me from the inside out so i'm waiting in line to use the toilet the woman comes up to me again and she's like you forgot to pay and i was like no i just paid you i just paid you a few seconds ago she's like you didn't pay and i was like yes i did queen i love you i can't wait to use your toilet i don't want to fight with you right now but i did just pay and i'm not going to pay again to go poop because i feel like that shouldn't be a thing anyway like i feel like i should be able to poop for free in general uh so i'm just paying once this time and she was like you didn't pay and i showed her my receipt and then she was like oh okay and then i and then i went to the bathroom and it was great and i feel great now my body feels uh super relaxed um but that experience was kind of traumatizing so now i am laying in a park just to try to decompress after what i've been through um although what was kind of magical is that while i was using the toilet a ladybug flew onto my arm inside of a building i don't know how a ladybug got in there but it was kind of a magical moment so me and this ladybug got to hang out while i was pooping and you know it was cute it was sweet but anyway yeah oh my god there's a [ __ ] eiffel tower right there can you see it [Music] do [Music] i was having a relaxing peaceful lunch and i go in my bag to get my wallet and it's not [ __ ] in there i [ __ ] lost my wallet listen it would be one thing if i was at home and i lost my wallet but i'm not in i'm not home it had all my credit cards in it luckily it didn't have my passport in it but it had my vaccine card like everything and i'm freaking out and i i had to have left it at the coffee shop that i was at before but that coffee shop closes in seven minutes and i'm literally seven minutes away so if they close early or they don't have it i'm [ __ ] but i had to have left it there that's that's because i because i used my credit card to pay there so it has to be there so i'm really hoping it's there because i it couldn't be anywhere else if it's not there i'm not i don't know everything just went to [ __ ] if i can find it though my day will be made and i will be i swear to god i will be the most i will never complain ever again about anything if i found my wallet right now you guys oh my god i [ __ ] found it it was at the coffee shop when i walked in they were like we know what you want and i was like yes what would i have done i don't know i i don't know i can now continue my adventure so life is good i just i'm appreciating life in a new light now you know it's funny this is why i normally don't carry a wallet like i don't even own a wallet like i'm literally using an envelope i forget [ __ ] everywhere i lose [ __ ] all the time so i never carry a wallet i always put things in my pocket but today i was like you know what we'll do a little wallet and then i [ __ ] lose it [Music] you

morning are you guys serving lunch yet um two iced coffees two hard-boiled eggs mixed salad thank you [Music] i got to paris yesterday morning i walked around for a few hours went to bed woke up at three in the morning couldn't go back to sleep and now it's like noon 12 p.m and i'm i am so tired see this is the thing about traveling to fun um international places is that for the first few days you can't even enjoy yourself because you're so tired but this morning i went to the grocery store to get some you know my hotel room essentials and i bought this almond milk okay this almond milk you don't understand if i could buy this in the u.s it would change my life this is the most incredible almond milk on the planet it's called bjorg almondii oh it has this like almond croissant flavor undertone and it is just the best thing on the planet i was thinking that i could go shopping today but i can't let myself do that because listen to what happened to me before i came to paris i was in new york when i was in new york i did a little bit of shopping nothing crazy just got a few things but those few things really pushed my suitcase over the edge my suitcase was overflowing um it took me like 20 minutes to close my suitcase and so you know i shouldn't have went shopping when i was in new york i thought it would be fine so i packed my suitcase extremely full i go to the airport to fly here and i put my suitcase on the scale and it's like 78 pounds and the lady was like sorry babe this is illegal to check like it's so heavy that we legally cannot put this on the plane and i was like what is a girl to do so i kid you not i ran into the bookstore you know like how in airports they have the little the little stores luckily they had a suitcase for sale in the bookstore in the airport it literally still has the tag on it which proves to you that i bought this in the airport anyway so i'm in the line to check my bag at the airport and i just rip open my suitcase and start throwing into that other suitcase and then i checked both bags everything was fine i hope that that story was exhilarating but the moral of the story is i'm not letting myself go shopping in paris because i can't have another situation like that i've been away from home for quite a while now honestly this whole month i've been away from home i went on like a two-week trip earlier this month now i'm on another trip i'm like weirdly going a little rogue like i've barely been home like i've always seen other people travel like this where they're always out of town and i'm always like ew that's a lot like the thought of living out of a suitcase was always really not appealing to me but i've been living out of a suitcase for almost the whole month and i'm kind of loving it i really don't i'm not homesick at all if somebody was like you can never go back to la i'd be like okay like i don't care like i don't care is this gross i don't know it's not gross to me i love hard-boiled eggs this just does not look good like this looks scary it tastes so much better than it looks though i'm in paris for fashion week i haven't gone to a fashion show in like two years so this is my first fashion show in like two years i actually brought my dad to paris with me so my dad's here um yeah good times all around i just made this table such a mess i feel bad holy this butter i i think i love butter ah [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you guys i'm freaking out what the have you ever seen fruit this perfect i've never seen fruit this perfect in my life i walked into this random corner store anyway they had the most perfect berries i've ever seen there's not one flawed berry in there except for that one but that's because i squished it okay there's not one i'm gonna eat all of them right now i don't understand what my obsession is with fruit right now it's all i talk about normally when you buy store-bought blackberries they suck these taste like if you were to be walking on like a trail and you just found a blackberry and you picked it off the bush and you ate it like this is exactly i've not had fruit this flavorful in years also this white shirt i've been wearing it for 10 days straight and it's so dirty but i've been traveling i don't know how to like wash my clothes i guess i could go to a laundromat but i'd kind of rather just wear the dirty shirt i don't think anyone's gonna notice somehow it doesn't smell bad yet no i'm not done that was good how are these so good it tastes like what the fruit's supposed to taste like so often when you buy fruit from the store it doesn't taste right but i eat a lot of fruit and i think i know what fruit is supposed to taste like by now but like this is some of the best fruit i've ever had what a life-changing experience look how dirty this shirt is can you like see like how it's all stained and everywhere i don't mind living like this this does not bother me as long as i don't smell bad i'm fine with the whole thing yes i would prefer to be wearing a clean shirt but i'm like going a little bit rogue you know and i mean i'm going a little bit rogue i've been traveling around being random being spontaneous being random and so what if i have to wear a dirty shirt that's the price you pay to be an adventurous this is my vibe right now my vibe is like i live out of my suitcase that's my vibe right now so this like disgusting white tank top that like feels damp and has felt damp for the past like three or so days this shirt matches my traveling vibe but it i swear to god it doesn't smell bad it actually like weirdly smells good which could be one of two things it could be that i'm immune to the bad smell or it could mean that i just have been reapplying deodorant responsibly i don't know it's crazy like what you can do in a hotel fridge i have leftover coffee here i'm in the process of making overnight oats infinite fruit selection pineapple blueberry raspberry strawberry hummus random carrot thing i don't even know what this is actually i found it at the grocery store absolutely no idea what this is i can't read the ingredients because i don't know how to read french i have so much great in here everything about how i just made this coffee was so like genuinely up in the morning i usually order an extra coffee so that you know i can just go in the fridge get my coffee that i got earlier and then make my own situation is that a little bit overkill yes but i think that i just genuinely enjoy i'm gonna be honest with you guys like i haven't washed my hair oh it's obvious i don't smell though like i don't like so it all i'm saying is yes i need to shower but it's not like i smell that's when i draw the line that's what i'm like emma you can't be doing this but i don't smell i'm just dirty there's a difference tomorrow's the show fashion week for me is very different than fashion week for some because some people go to fashion week and they go to like 10 different fashion shows i only go to one and i get very tired after one i'm happy just going to one show i love it tomorrow's gonna be fun let's be honest here i just don't have anything to say like i'm tired [Music]

morning i woke up at like 9 30 and i usually wake up at like 6 30 okay so i feel like a [ __ ] loser right now but i kind of wanted to have like a shopping day in new york i try not to let myself go shopping too often but i'm like you know what i'm in new york baby there's just so many great stores all in one area don't look at my nails i got them done two days ago and two of them are already broken actually three of them i don't want to talk about it very sore subject for me anyway there are so many great stores all in one area and i'm going to take advantage of that today although it's like 10 30 so not everything's open yet not really sure what to do with myself [Music] my first stop just had to be one of the gift shops like i'm sorry i don't own anything that says i heart new york on it and i feel like that's just like wrong so i went a little bit too crazy but it's like i couldn't help myself i've been eyeing the iheart new york pajama pants since i got here because i keep seeing them at the gift shops gray and pink pajamas okay now that i've gotten my touristy shopping done i can really focus on you know getting things that will make my closet more interesting although i would argue that these these are gonna make my closet more interesting part of my brain was like emma you don't need to get the touristy stuff like everybody gets the touristy stuff but it's what my heart wanted my heart wanted that [ __ ] so i did it especially the pj pants like i'm stoked about those i'm gonna wear those way too much like i'm gonna wear those like as an outfit like i'm gonna wear those i'm gonna style those like i'm gonna style them into an outfit like i'm not playing around with those like those are actually a fashion statement for me i'm really excited to be honest i'm already ready for another coffee which is really annoying [Music] i had to come back to the room for a little reset before i started shopping because i already got tired i didn't even start shopping yet and i already got tired i mean i just needed to come back to the room and then i'm gonna head out and we're gonna really do a shopping day but i just like needed a sec walking around new york is so genuinely exhausting it really takes a toll on your body like i've been i never take naps anymore and i've been taking a nap like every day since i've gotten here because the walking just kicks my ass my body's just not used to it because in la i just don't have to walk also i really don't want to wear a turtleneck anymore like it's 80 degrees out today why am i wearing a turtleneck yeah i just need a sec to readjust and then we're going out we're going out okay we're really gonna make it happen we're really gonna have a shopping day i actually purposely packed light so that i'd have room to buy a few things if something catches my eye i'm excited i just need a second [Music] so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] i'm so [ __ ] exhausted i even got my nails done and i didn't get long nails which is very rare for me but i'm just sick of getting long nails because they just break so quickly so now we have boring short nails but at least these won't break you know it was a good day although i'm on the verge of dropping dead um it would be completely inappropriate for me to not do a haul obviously we needed to get the iheart new york pj pants i mean it was like it was a must for me i don't know why i don't know what came over me but i had to have those and i had to have them in two colors don't know sometimes my brain does things that i don't understand even though i am myself not to mention like the quality of these is literally terrible they feel like cardboard but i'm gonna wear them i'm going to wear them in inappropriate amount i'm going to wear them a lot i'm going to wear them to meetings i'm going to wear them to the airport i'm going to wear them at home i'm going to wear them to the grocery store it's going to be disturbing how often i wear them i had to get a i heard new york zip up okay part of the reason why i got this was because i didn't bring enough sweatshirts on this trip and i'm going to be gone for like another two weeks i'm not going back to la for like two weeks uh so i need sweatshirts and i mean i love representing new york if anybody asks me if i'm from new york while i'm wearing this i'm going to answer yes even though that's not true but a little white lie never hurt anybody although now that i think about it i feel like people who actually live in new york and grew up in new york would never ever buy a sweatshirt this is iheart new york on it i don't know maybe that's like maybe that's okay but i feel like that's more of a tourist thing anyway um i got tote bag this is very cute i only brought like mini purses on this trip and this doesn't hold anything i cannot fit anything in here if i'm going out and i'm just bringing my phone and my credit card great this works like a charm otherwise i am screwed and that's why i bought tote bags i also got this pink one i don't know it was just cute it spoke to me um i can use these for grocery shopping carrying things around the remainder of the stuff i got is all thrifted not really but like kind of like thrifted but like cheating because i went to stores that are heavily curated like they really choose the good [ __ ] and then mark up the price a fuckton which in my opinion is like cheating with thrifting but it's still kind of thrifting it's more like vintage shopping i guess but some of this stuff isn't vintage this i'm stoked about i just know i'm gonna wear this a lot and i have a hard time finding jackets that i like and this one just spoke to me um and it's really good quality also this zipper detail situation right here i probably shouldn't put my mouth on that should i i don't know who owned this before me this zipper detail is very precious to me so this is a great jacket i also got this vest which was so random but i liked it like this over top of a um turtleneck white shirt with some jeans super cute fall vibes um that was kind of my vision today when i was shopping i was like what am i going to be wearing this fall let's get that running like let's start running with that i also got these pants these are like these green little pants situation the back is what really sold me i mean that's like a beautiful back i love that they fit great they're not too tight i hate wearing tight pants but they're not like too loose where they're like not flattering anyway they were they are good they're great although the mirror in the dressing room of that vintage store that i went to was terrible so i um i'm a little nervous about how that stuff actually looks on me because i couldn't really tell because the mirror and the lighting in the room was awful when i'm shopping i go more based on vibe anyway like i'm like do i feel good in this i think i do next i got this long knit skirt okay now my thing is with this is that i don't want to wear this like a summery skirt it's like knit material as you can see i want to wear this with like a sweater and some chunky boots or like some chunky loafers and wear this is kind of like a fall skirt which is very california of me i live in california unfortunately actually is it unfortunate i'm still trying to figure that out sometimes i'm like living in california sucks i hate l.a and then the next day i'm like i love california i grew up here i'm a california girl through and through i belong here i'm exhausted with myself i don't know then i got this very simple red sweater i'm not even gonna talk about it it's a [ __ ] red turtleneck i got this pink sweater okay now i know what you might be saying i know you might be like emma why did you spend a lot of money on a sweater that's just pink and you what hello may i ask who's calling who bye this sweater fits so well like i know you're like emma it's a [ __ ] pink sweater yes but this collection is one of my favorite louis vuitton collections ever so i felt like that was enough to justify my purchase last but not least this is not vintage but i just thought it was a cute basic i got this this is very out of my comfort zone and not something i would normally buy i really like colors like this they're very playful and i don't own a lot of things in like fun playful colors like that i'm just trying to broaden my basics in my closet [Music] you

i went back to la and then i lasted in l.a for probably four days and then i just couldn't do it anymore and would you look at that i'm back in new york not even a week later [Music] i just can't stay away i love it here i feel like i live here i've been in new york more days this month than i've been in la and i love it so this morning i got into new york at 6 a.m and i immediately went to my airbnb because i had this whole concept where i wanted to rent an airbnb i wanted to rent an apartment in new york because i wanted to really experience what it's like being a new york local you know i wanted to go grocery shopping live in a traditional apartment i wanted to really experience new york as new york rather than experiencing new york through the lens of a hotel room because it's just not the same like the fact that i can call the front desk at any time and say hey can i have a glass of water like that's not good okay so i was like you know what i'm gonna book an airbnb and i'm going to stay in a real new york apartment for a week test it out see how it feels who knows anyway get to the airbnb this morning there's all these instructions on how to open the gate and then how to open the front door and you know the whole thing all of it was very complicated for some reason and took like 20 minutes to figure out finally once i unlocked all the doors and i was inside the apartment i realized that the apartment was not what it was advertised online the photographs versus the reality were so incredibly different that i had to leave unfortunately so now i'm in a hotel so they're like i listened i tried to experience a real new york experience if anybody wants to get mad at me and say emma how do you know that you love new york how do you know that you want to move to new york all you do is stay in hotels nobody's ever said that to me by the way for those imaginary people who are making that argument i did try and it didn't go as planned um and now i'm in a hotel part of me feels like i'm weak you know what i mean like am i just weak am i just kind of a [ __ ] i didn't take any photos of it i didn't document any part of that experience i was like i just want to get out of here everybody wants to see a photo of what it looks like my mom my dad i'm like no you guys i couldn't stay in there for more than 0.5 seconds i had to go the silver lining of the whole thing is that i decided to stay in a random hotel that i've never stayed at before to my surprise it was right across the street from a trader joe's i didn't really get anything that fun if i'm being honest i got some overnight oats you know spicy hummus i got a bunch of blueberries because okay i've been really into strawberries recently they've been in season and they've been delicious but for whatever reason my strawberry face is morphing into a blueberry phase so like now i'm really into blueberries and i bought three of these and i can guarantee that they will be gone by tomorrow i eat like one of these every hour i i swear to god whatever i got some raspberries carrot it nobody gives a [ __ ] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] my idea of unwinding is eating fruit in bed the weather in new york is so perfect right now it's like 73 degrees it's perfect and that's not good for me because being in new york when it's 73 degrees is so incredible that it makes me want to move here the problem is is that it's giving me a false sense of reality here because the wintertime is brutal here but right now all i'm seeing and all i'm experiencing is new york when it's 73 degrees so it's hard for my brain to imagine it being winter time here i just need to remind myself constantly that this is not how the weather is all year round ah this is my second box of blueberries of the day that i've eaten they're hitting they're hitting right now i'm contemplating whether or not i go out to dinner i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty exhausted the thought of going out to dinner i think i just ate a moldy one one of the blueberries just kind of tasted like cheese just like a little bit i'm kind of at a crossroads here like i have enough food in my room where i could in theory make a full meal like in my room i could in theory do that but it's gonna be a little bit depressing like it's gonna consist of weird [ __ ] it's not gonna be pretty or i could go and get dinner somewhere i'm just like weighing out my priorities [Music] this is the truth like this is really what i do when i'm traveling [Music] i just like i i get really tired and i get too lazy to go out and figure out something to eat for dinner and so i just end up doing this and it's i enjoy it like listen i have so many fun options i can have like a protein bar i have some hummus you know i have my eggs what else i could have a clip oh i just got ow ow why is my toe cramping look at it do you see it it's cramping do you see it ow why does my toe why i have some potato chips that could be fun chocolate could be fun like i have options hummus on eggs is so good like i don't care i don't care nothing like a home-cooked meal get my veggies in with a little baby carrot and hummus vibe i'm getting a little creative it tastes a little bit disgusting because these are pizza flavor um and dipping pizza flavored crackers into hummus is like maybe not the best i had a long day i've been through a lot sometimes this is just what you have to do uh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] i

bath it's probably been you know three or four years since i've taken a bath or at least since i can remember taking a bath i'm naked and i'm genuinely terrified that there's some way that you can see my naked body right now like i'm scared that there's like a reflection somewhere that i'm unaware of but what are you gonna do i'm in the bathtub because in two days i'm about to go to the most terrifying but exciting event that i've ever been to in two days i'm going to my first met gala which is just unfathomable for me ever since i became aware of what the met gala was it's been one of those things that was so fascinating to me the mecca to me has always seemed like something that was completely unattainable for me like in no universe did i ever um the megillah never even remotely crossed my mind as a possibility ever i'm going in two days but i do not believe it i'm completely in denial i don't even know what i'm supposed to be feeling i'm not nervous it's more just like fear of the unknown but i'm not nervous about it i had no idea how much [ __ ] i would have to get done fittings you know meetings like all this [ __ ] like it's crazy it's crazy and i still have not fully comprehended the fact that i'm going to this event i've been running around so much you know doing last-minute stuff to prepare that like my entire body just hurts which is why i'm in the tub i just had my final fitting tonight where i tried on my dress for the last time before i'm going to wear it at the event and i'm obsessed with it i just literally don't even know what to think or what to say about this it just doesn't feel like a real thing that's gonna happen to me my brain is a literal of mashed potatoes right now like my brain is literally oatmeal right now if you were to cut open my head right now you would find baby food being somebody who struggles with anxiety i'm very frightened by the fact that i don't have anxiety about going to the met gala that makes no sense i almost feel like there's something wrong with me because i'm not panicking about it it's bizarre the plot twist of the whole thing is that i'm going to the event of course but i'm also interviewing other guests for youtube and vogue while i'm there i feel like that should make me really scared but for some reason i'm not why am i not nervous i almost just literally ate [ __ ] in the bathtub throughout my experience being on the internet and doing the whole thing there's been so many parts of it that i just can't comprehend and like this is obviously one of them but even just you know the entire concept of my life sometimes i struggle to comprehend and i think that my brain instead of trying to comprehend it just turns a little numb and i think that that's what's happening right now can you tell how [ __ ] tired i am looking to me in my eyes right now tell me i'm not tired the reason why i'm tired is because i'm jet lagged because i was in paris and then i came here and i'm sleep deprived and jet lagged and confused and i haven't known what day of the week it was for the past week i could not tell you i could not tell you i think it's saturday right now people are probably out on the [ __ ] town right now celebrating the weekend but here's me in the bathtub because i don't even know what day of the week it is life is a highway and i'm going to ride it all night long all right i'm getting out of the bath now [Music] [Music] so [Music] i can't sleep as i said earlier i'm not nervous but i'm just excited tomorrow's going to be an extremely busy day and like i am going to be going from 7 a.m to like 10 p.m and i'm starting to get freaked out right because it's like okay it is one in the morning i'm not sleeping yet [ __ ] i mean i'll be fine that's literally what coffee is for also i keep talking with my hands because i got my nails done they're also extremely long let's talk about that for a second i can't do anything with these i have no idea how i'm gonna wipe my ass genuinely and i actually have to pee a little bit so i'm gonna go pee and i'm gonna wipe my ass and i'm gonna come back and i'm gonna tell you how it goes okay it was actually completely fine somehow me peeing just now was like the easiest thing i've done since i've gotten these nails done tomorrow's the [ __ ] day you guys like we're doing it there's no backing out now we're in it we're in it to win it i think the biggest thing is that i'm i'm definitely kind of emotionally exhausted right because it's kind of all i've been thinking about even though i'm very excited about it and there's like no negative feelings about it whatsoever it's still like weirdly emotionally exhausting to be like so hyper fixated on like one event it takes a lot of energy to like fixate on something that hard everything that i've been doing every day has revolved around tomorrow i'm honestly setting my alarm for 6 30 so that i can have a nice morning to myself that's like relaxing and relatively meditative will i wake up at 6 30. thank you for calling room service by john george at the mark we are currently assisting other guests please stay on the line and someone will be with you shortly thank you for calling room service bye john so we're not ordering coffee this morning so i thought i was gonna like wake up early this morning and do a whole thing wake up at like 6 a.m get out of bed wash my face go get coffee you know walk around the city [ __ ] no none of that happened uh i need a coffee now right now yes thank you thank you this is [ __ ] embarrassing [Music] getting married this is literally my marriage i'm marrying myself tonight [Music] that's [ __ ] crazy that i don't even feel [Music] i feel sick okay i think we should start to then yes [Music] [Music] look but they took one of her leaning not this she was like leaning dances and vogue took it and like they look at look at that mask oh my god we have to see the one i'm wearing pjs for the after party

have a free day in Paris I don't like doing touristy things so what I usually tend to do is I just go out and walk around and see what I can find I feel like super touristy things in theory are enjoyable but I don't think that they are that enjoyable I think that you may have more fun trying to like pretend to be a local I want to blend in [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] well I had such a beautiful morning I felt like a local it was great uh I found this little green whatever the [ __ ] this is I have no idea what this is might be a plum these raspberries look juicy as [ __ ] let's try it out mmm very juicy okay that was fun can I order the green bean artichoke salad in iced latte with almond milk okay great thank you last night I got this green wait what is it green bean artichoke salad I don't know what's really in it but it was so good and what's so weird to me is that I don't normally like green beans or artichoke I like it makes no sense that I love this salad but I got it last night and it was like the best thing I'd ever eaten in my life naturally I have to get it again today but it was so good today when I was ordering my croissant I obviously don't speak French and I couldn't really understand what the woman was saying when she was trying to describe to me what flavor the croissant was so I just kind of was taking a risk you know I had no idea what type of croissant I was getting and it was a [ __ ] chocolate croissant and I was like honestly this is the best moment of my life because those are my favorite croissants actually I do love almond croissants almond croissants are crazy I am severely jet lagged I slept for three hours last night the night before that I slept for four hours it's safe to say that I am not functioning properly when I'm really exhausted I start to feel like I'm dreaming like I keep catching myself zoning out like I'll just sit and then all of a sudden I'll just start staring and then my mind will go blank I do that probably once every 20 minutes right now where's my phone [Music] foreign coffee of the day what makes this taste so good it has to be like the dressing or something so I'm actually going to New York tomorrow because I'm going to an event there a very very exciting event that I'm also very nervous to attend for this event I have to wear a fancy outfit so I'm going to a fitting in about an hour in Paris for my outfit for the event in New York I really want to know what this is it eggplant it might be if it's eggplant I might be an eggplant fan now but I also just don't know what it is it could be pig intestines and I would have no idea [Music] I woke up at 6am this morning it was pitched black outside and to be honest I don't know why I did that because now it's like 1 30 in the afternoon and I feel exhausted and I had no reason to be up at 6am when I'm on vacation though like I want to make the most of the day that's why I always try to wake up really early but then it just ends up making me tired and then I end up having to take a nap and then it's like well what was the point you know what was I talking about what was I talking about is that a hair it is but I think it's probably mine so there's no need to throw a fit Life's too short I've always felt like that like if there's a hair in my food it doesn't really bother me unpopular opinion but like it's not that gross having someone's hair in your food like yeah it's not the I don't want it but it's like things could be worse a fingernail much worse a booger that's way worse and chances are you wouldn't even be able to see it or tell that it was in your food because it'd probably blend in um [Music] foreign [Music] the jet lag is hitting me today bad I always think that like I'm gonna get away with not getting jet lagged and then it always creeps up on me at some point it's like 5 p.m and I'm ready to go to bed I ordered some room service that might revive me I kind of doubt it I think I'm like done for the day but I don't want to be done for the day this is the most tired I've been in six months and you can like see it in my face too you can see in my face that I'm struggling I'm just like thinking about how stupid it would be if I had a coffee you know what I mean like how dumb is that I actually had four coffees today which is way more than normal I usually only have one to two today I had four it's not my fault that the coffee here is just incredible it just tempts me at every corner foreign [Music] hopefully this does something [Music] [Music] thank you foreign I always get my energy at the worst times now it's you know 9 30 and now I have energy where was that energy when it was light out we cannot tell my mom that I'm taking a walk right now because she would be pissed but I'm 20 years old and I need my Independence there's nothing like an evening walk when I was younger my dad and I would go on a walk every night even if it was like 11 o'clock my dad and I would go on a walk it's such a good memory like that's a really great memory for me so whenever I go on a night walk I feel nostalgic my mom hates it though she hates it she's probably watching this punching her screen right now Mom I'm sorry I get to like see all of the sights you know look into all the museums look into all the clothing stores and there's no crowds there's no one around like I get to take my time and look at everything do you know what I mean am I just making excuses maybe but like it feels like I have the city to myself and I really prefer that because I'm a little bit selfish [Music] where did all my energy come from you guys saw me like three hours ago I was not doing okay why am I okay now like now I want to party like now I'm ready to party like I'm trying to go out to dinner now you know what I mean like I'm I want to get a drink I'm legal here I'm allowed to drink alcohol in Europe so I've only had one glass of wine this whole trip and I feel like that's not enough you know what I'm gonna have my own party maybe I'll do a little champagne evening I don't ever drink champagne I don't really know like I don't know what either of these are okay so this is a champagne dudes Brut eclassic so that's champagne this is lemon so okay well I can't read this one at all so we're not doing that one how does this work wait I'm actually scared to open this because it's dangerous oh [ __ ] how do I get this open without hurting myself oh this is not a champagne glass I'm obviously not good at wine give me a few more years and I'll be good at wine but right now I am very novice okay see this is what we want this is what we want I never thought I would like wine um okay okay so if that's what wine is going to do to my body I don't know if it's my thing but um

[Music] [Music] the last 48 hours have been absolute chaos I'm leaving for a trip and I'm going to be gone for 10 days 10 days is like a long time it's not that big of a deal but it's a long time like there's a lot of preparation that goes into being gone for 10 days I had to get my nail fixed because for some reason I always break my left pointer finger nail like that's always the nail that gets broken I decided to get my eyebrows done I had to go to the grocery store to get snacks I had to pick up some things from the dry cleaners when I was younger I used to just throw random pieces of clothing into my suitcase and call it a day but that strategy does not work for me anymore now I tend to pick out my outfits before I leave I just find that it works better for me the only problem is that the amount of time that goes into picking out outfits is always more than I expect today I spent eight hours eight hours eight not an exaggeration picking out outfits for my trip I do not regret it I'm so [ __ ] excited wait I'm like red now I'm gonna wait for myself to cool down I'm very excited to be honest I didn't pack a lot of casual outfits most of the outfits that I packed are kind of a little more fancy it's kind of going to force me to dress up a little bit on a day-to-day basis I just put on blue jeans and a white tank top and call it a day but I'm gonna be on vacation I want to look badass like it's not rocket science [Music] did our flight get delayed by four hours yes but [Music] foreign holy [ __ ] I'm here I have approximately I have 10 minutes until I leave for dinner and I just got off the plane like I'm fresh off the plane I'm stinky um and I need to make myself look as presentable as possible in 10 minutes there was some drama with the plane we were about to take off and they were like oh the plane's broken but they ended up fixing the plane it just took four hours so my flight ended up being delayed by four hours which is not the end of the world but I'm here a little bit late and now I have to go to dinner and I'm not ready and I'm sweaty and I like don't have time to shower so I'm gonna need to like get creative to make myself look clean like I have not brushed my teeth in over 24 hours I've not showered in over 24 hours I'm like majorly stinky right now I'm majorly stinky I also need to poop no time for that though we're just gonna have to work with oily hair today and that's just what just the cards I was dealt today oh I like to wipe my teeth with a towel after I brush them and I don't know if that's embarrassing also why do I have like red dots all over my face like what is it is that a mosquito bite or is it like I don't know I don't have time to be thinking about these things I think I have enough time to do a little bit of makeup so let's go crazy it's also the evening time so nobody's even gonna really be able to see what I look like at this hour so I just need to like do the bare minimum somebody just run my doorbell and I'm not wearing pants I'm about to go answer my door like this that looks good enough to me like I feel so disoriented like my body feels like it's 10 in the morning but it's 7 P.M it's not my favorite sensation but after getting a good night's sleep tonight if that's possible I will be adjusted but for now I feel a little bit off and Confused oh I can blend this up foreign we're wearing a dress today which is kind of abnormal but what is this rash going on good [Music] sure [Music] hello good morning um can I order an iced latte with almond milk uh it's okay for now thank you perfect thank you that's perfect thank you good morning [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] here we are streaming live on YouTube at the incredible Louis Vuitton foundation for the 2021 final of the lvmh prize what is the lvmh fashion prize this was established in 2013 to help young designers aged 18 to 40 from all over the world jump start their careers and fashion foreign [Music] that was a little bit scary I was hosting an event and I had to do some public speaking which I'm not great at the public speaking was live which means no room for mistakes luckily I only had one line that I had to say and I did not mess up so that's comforting but [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] I have no idea what's in the salad I don't recognize any of the vegetables wow whatever that is it's delicious so I'm just not gonna ask questions um I don't know what I'm eating though I normally don't like tomatoes but there's no way Paris would have bad tomatoes so I ordered the tomatoes with this cheese thing ball cheese ball it's great okay I see green beans in the salad some sort of nut maybe artichoke like I don't know honestly I feel like I would live in Paris if I spoke French like I would move here tomorrow but my desire to live in France is not strong enough to get me to learn how to speak French so therefore it's not gonna happen I don't think I had one glass of water today okay is this like a radish I don't care there's kind of something exciting about not knowing exactly what you're eating like I don't really know what's in the salad so when I took a bite of it I just started chewing instead of thinking of the ingredients I was just like oh I enjoy this for what it is I have no idea what it is but I enjoy it for what it is food in Paris is truly so much better I don't know why for lunch today I had some rice okay normally rice is extremely boring this rice was the best rice I've ever had in my life maybe the ingredients are fresher I don't know everything here tastes good I normally don't like tomatoes I normally don't like green beans I'm eating both of them right now and I'm enjoying it so much that was so delicious and I still don't know what it was when I'm by myself I eat like a monster when I'm around other people like I feel like I'm very polite you know or try to be anyway [Music] when I'm by myself there's none of that I've never in my life eaten a plate full of tomatoes and been like oh that was a good experience until right now did I order a hard-boiled egg yes people [ __ ] on hard-boiled eggs and think that they're so gross I do not care I love hard-boiled eggs they smell awful it smells like a literal fart but oh my God you know it could be really good if I dip some of the wait check me out was there anything in here no that's weird now watch this magic we take the egg this could be gross but I'm just freestyling here taking the egg rubbing it around in the pesto pesto egg not as good as I thought maybe putting hot sauce on it will help hot sauce and pesto egg I'm telling you guys I'm off the rails when I'm by myself I love pesto that much that I would literally lick it with my finger [ __ ] yeah [Music]

camera wow I did a lot of research and I was like okay what's the best camera for point and shoot film and it was this one I think it's a vintage camera and I did a lot of research on how to use it because I didn't want to just get a film camera a point and shoot that's like nice and not like learn how to use it uh and now it's time to play I am actually officially the last person on the planet to get a point-and-shoot film camera I kind of want to get good at it I really love taking photos I'm just gonna start taking this around with me and I'll see what happens maybe I'll get good at photography honestly it's not promised God this camera is gorgeous I I feel like I don't deserve it to be honest and I probably don't when I ordered it I thought I got a silver one but the gold one came in the mail and I'm not gonna lie I think I like the gold one more so I'm very excited well here's another hobby that God knows I'm not gonna follow through actually this I think I'm going to get into but also there's no film in it so that photo didn't take but I was just why is Declan literally trying to eat my tripod oh it's because I didn't feed him yet it is 7am in my defense it's 7 A.M [Music] I carry a purse around now that's a new advancement I just started carrying purses wearing heels it's all happening I love getting piercings as you can see I have quite a few my body does not react well to piercings at all I would say nine out of ten times I get a piercing they get infected unfortunately one of my piercings did get a little bit inflamed and infected and I did get a keloid if you don't know what a keloid is it's basically I actually don't know but I'm going to the dermatologist to get it fully removed because they're not the cutest and I'm also going to the dermatologist because I've had a rash under my armpit for over a year now and I don't know what it is so I'm going to ask her what that is maybe get some sort of cream to get rid of it you can't even see the rash anymore it's not visible I just can feel it and it's itchy but if I were to show you right now like you wouldn't be able to see it which doesn't make any sense to me so she's probably going to be like sweetheart there's no rash on your armpit and I'm gonna be like no you just gotta trust me it's itchy under there I feel it maybe it is visible let's whip out my armpit at this red light and see if we can see it you can't even see the rash you can't see it I'm like should I even bring it up to her because it's like literally not visible foreign [Music] I've ever attended my keloid on my ear is like basically too small to remove because I kind of fixed it On My Own by like cleaning it and draining it like I drained it of all the pus myself and so okay that was that and then with the rash on my armpit she was like I can't see it and because of that I can't diagnose it so you should just put moisturizer on it that was pointless are you what um so okay okay that's exciting uh do I take a selfie with it to like warm it up to like make sure it works let's do that are people gonna watch me do it yep but that's enough for now getting my camera set up just made my day and now I'm less mad that I went to the dermatologist for no reason like that kind of revived me and got me excited for life again I feel good about that um I love listening to 80s music on my record player that's enough do I need to go to the grocery store what day is it I do need to go to the grocery store why am I always at the grocery store okay I'm about to do something illegal even my car rejected my decision to be illegal just now I'm going to the  grocery store again and I'm excited like I love it there there's only one type of store that's more fun than the grocery store and it's Target I hadn't gone to Target in probably six months and then a few days ago I decided to go and I was in there for two hours as the story always is I went into Target needing to get one thing and I left with an entire cart filled with things and I know that that's like the cliche when it comes to Target like oh you're coming you think you're only gonna get one thing and then you leave and you I get it but it is kind of true like I was in Target and I was like you know what I could use a new frying pan Target is really fun the grocery store is a close second that's why we're here but also because I do need things I need things I need butter lettuce butter lettuce is actually in my opinion the best lettuce debating whether or not I go on a rant about why I'll save you guys the time [Music] foreign [Music] oh my god do you know what I can't help myself I need to go on a butter lettuce Spiel butter lettuce is the only lettuce I like the texture is like perfect crunchy but it's not so crunchy that it's like annoying to chew through it's like kind of soft but crunchy at the same time according to this packaging it actually has more iron than spinach seriously with three milligrams of iron per serving and crunchy so do it that what you want [Music] foreign [Music] in bed and eating strawberries that are not washed this is just like how I live the amount of bugs that I probably consume on a daily basis because I eat unwashed strawberries is scary to me and frightening but so Summer's pretty much over it's September now but I'm actually not that sad because I actually really love fall I love the crispness of the air there is one thing that I didn't do that I really wanted to do that is swim in the ocean at sunset foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
S4iDB9NhGck,cool,"i made the same hummus toast today and used the pickled carrots on top instead of using grated baby carrots (for the record, grating baby carrots is pretty much impossible) and it was delicious. just wanted to share. anyway, love you. -emma

never eat in bed this is catastrophic are you kidding me i saw this photo on pinterest and i had to recreate it hummus is my favorite food toast is my favorite food i'm enjoying this this was so good yeah that was good i have a zoom meeting in eight minutes i think i'm gonna start making it a goal for myself that i need to try one new recipe that i find on pinterest per week it doesn't need to be hard just something even like that i'm so impressed with how good that toast was like that was good good work emma it's 90 degrees today 90 degrees is too much although i am going to force myself to go outside today because i spent yesterday in bed and the day before so like today i need to like really kind of uh switch up the program but it is 90 degrees that is a little bit too hot for mommy hi hi it feels kind of like friday today and it felt like thursday yesterday and i'm just [Music] do [Music] it is it is so hot out okay i just contemplated going to the beach but i don't think i have the stamina for that right now so the other day i was wearing these brown pants i couldn't figure out what kind of shoes to wear with them because brown pants are tough and i tried on a bunch of black boots and stuff whatever and i was like this is not working but i really want to wear these pants and i dug deep into my closet and i found these cream heeled boots healed and they looked great with the pants so i was like okay am i about to wear heels right now voluntarily yes and that's never happened i've never worn heels voluntarily in public and i always see people out on friday nights or even out during the week wearing heels and just like walking around like it's nothing and i've always envied those people but i really wanted to wear those brown pants and the heeled boots were the only shoe that looked good with the pants so guess what i did i wore heels around town all day i emma chamberlain wore heels all day casually in public and it changed my life i was doing casual things that day you know i got my nails done i went to the grocery store i went to rite aid like i did a bunch of casual but i was wearing these heeled boots and for some reason every experience i had that day felt elevated i felt i don't know the world kind of turned into my runway that day i was like strutting around the way i was walking with this new found confidence i was almost frightened of how the heels took over my body like i started walking with a new little hip movement or something like something clicked in me my body and my mind disconnected and like my body was doing what it wanted in these heels and my mind was like what are you doing what are you doing i think for a long time especially when i was younger i was really nervous about dressing up wearing heels or like wearing a purse or wearing a outfit that i thought was fashionable like i think i used to be scared to do that because i was subconsciously scared that people would think that i was trying too hard but now i do not give a [Music] i have like a favorite gas station that i always go to it's my happy place like i i know how this place runs i know how it functions it also has like the craziest snack selection inside like they actually have good snacks like most gas stations the snacks are like exactly what you would imagine like whatever but this place has like good snacks like for example if you randomly needed oat milk from the gas station don't know why you would but it's possible they for some reason have oat milk [Music] [Music] [Music] ah wow this is delicious jasmine green tea it's really good actually something inside of me was telling me to try something new and also get something that wasn't water it's really refreshing and floral and i normally don't like floral flavors but this is really hitting the spot cool [Music] [Applause] [Music] i just went into a camera store because i wanted to buy a point-and-shoot film camera i think i'm the last person on the planet to get one if i'm being honest everybody has a film camera okay except for me i'm i feel left out at this point i also love taking photos so i think it would be a fun addition to my life so i went to a camera store to get one and i was like i don't know what i'm doing i don't know what i want the guy working there was like we only have one and it's not that good i appreciate the honesty because there's nothing i appreciate more than an honest salesman i picture myself wearing this with like a black skirt in a black bralette with some black boots i could wear it to like a party some sort of like weekend event and it even has some sequins in it the last thing i needed if we're being honest was another collared button-up shirt like i feel like i have way too many of them and i never wear them but this one was just too gorgeous beautiful this fine black stitching it's just so dainty and i feel like this could be cute worn open with a black tank top or a black bralette under it in some black boots again i mean this is just gorgeous oh my god i could even wear this under something and have this beautiful collar poking out like wear a vest over it or something or no maybe like a zip up i don't know this might have to be my favorite color actually that's not true my favorite color is green but i think if this is kind of like a statement jacket you know i could wear a white tank top blue levi's throw this on top and it kind of does the work for me this can kind of carry the weight of the outfit these pants what are you doing i think the design on it is quite precious and i love a good pant that's comfortable but can also be worn out to like a party or something i talk like i go to parties all the time why am i like i feel like my belt collection is not great i really like belts i think they're actually a really underrated accessory and i feel like a lot of people look at belts as like oh i need to keep my pants up that's fine but i also want to use belts as an accessory i just don't have a lot of them whenever i find a good belt i just don't question it i don't think twice i just hand my credit card over so i love this one because this kind of like bone looking material is very charming to me i feel like this is great for like a 70s look this belt is hot it's thick it's chunky i'm gonna overuse this belt my dad told me once my dad told me once he was like everything needs a paparazzi your home your outfit everything always could use a pop of red i think it's really true i think that having a pop of red can just change everything and i think this could really be the pop of red in a lot of outfits for me and last but not least i got this silver belt because i just could not help myself it also kind of gives me a little 80s vibe do i know what i'm talking about no i don't could i be getting the decades completely wrong i probably am but that's the risk that i'm willing to take for the chance that i actually got the decade right in which case you should be impressed because i was born in 2001. [Music] [Music] [Music] every time i'm at a restaurant and they put pickled onions or pickled carrots in my meal it like makes my day and it's so easy to make vinegar water sugar and salt in a pot and you boil it and then you pour it over the chopped vegetables and then you put it in the fridge and then you have pickled vegetables it's so easy so that was my adventurous cooking excursion of the day hopefully they turned out okay there's probably some blood in them from my injury so i will not be sharing this batch with other people um yeah it smells bad it's pretty good [Music] you

[Music] it looks like it's cold out but it's literally 80 degrees is that a pimple great it's raining a little bit i'm getting some tropical vibes from this like tropical storm vibes if i close my eyes it feels like miami i've never been to miami i already feel my morning poop moving like it took four sips and like i'm i gotta go i gotta go bye [Music] the waiter brings me the check and i realized i didn't even bring my credit card and i started texting my mom and i was like mom i don't know what to do like i don't have money to pay for my lunch this is like the one day that i decide to go to a nice hotel for lunch i was like you know what i'm gonna treat myself i'm gonna spend 22 on a chopped salad and then i forget my wallet and i just was like oh my god like i do not belong here and i don't have a way to pay for my lunch and like this is gonna just be the most embarrassing experience of my life but um they take apple pay i can't even count how many times apple pay has saved my ass so i'm very grateful the restaurant that i went to is kind of one of those places where the food is good and it's good you're kind of paying for the ambiance that restaurant has this sort of old hollywood feel like you can almost feel the ghosts sitting at the table with you like i know hundreds and thousands of old hollywood actors died in there like you just i can just feel it and it was almost like i got to eat lunch with them so maybe i wasn't really alone it's very haunted in there it's kind of terrifying but i also like that feeling i live in la i hate most parts of it but there's little like slivers of old hollywood in the midst of l.a and that's exciting and kind of magical in its own way the rest of la sucks though [Music] i've driven by this vintage furniture store probably seven million times but i've never had like a free chance to go in and i think today's the day am i gonna buy anything of course not i don't know how to transport furniture i'm gonna look at it more like a museum rather than actually shopping because i don't know i don't know how to buy furniture nobody teaches you that [Music] is it illegal to pop my zit at a red light i don't think so why did i look at it why did i look at it i wiped it and i was like oh and now it's a green light you know everybody was looking into my car like this is popping a fatty pimple ah grocery shopping just makes me feel safe and happy i do not think that there's anything i love more than just going to the grocery store ever since i was younger going to the grocery store is like my favorite activity it feels like time doesn't exist problems don't exist it's just you and in the produce [Music] so i saw these white strawberries and i've been on a strawberry kick recently like obsessed with strawberries i eat literally three packages this size per day this is my thing right now and so of course like i need to try this haunted breed of strawberries i hate the appearance so i'm pretty lost about what i'm supposed to be feeling right now they taste good but they have a slight different flavor like they almost have an apple something about this is giving me the essence of apples even the texture kind of reminds me of an apple a little bit but yet it's still very much a strawberry i just bought these literally 30 seconds ago like five of them were moldy and there was only like eight in the whole container you know it's like what are we doing [Music] i've had like an ongoing stomach ache for like four days straight i can't even feel it anymore at this point like it pretty much all sensation in my abdomen went away but maybe maybe the tea will help i feel like i need to move to seattle or something where the weather's like this every day because i feel like i get more done when it's foggy this is an interesting concept that i've been thinking about when it's sunny out you feel all this internal pressure to like make the most of the day because the weather's good and you're like okay i need to get a lot done and spend time outside and do the whole thing but then when it's foggy out mentally you're like okay i don't have to do anything today because are you kidding me no when it's foggy outside and the weather is not as good there's like no pressure to do anything because the weather sucks so if you spend all day in bed it's like who cares but then for some reason because there's no pressure to make the most of the day i actually end up doing more on foggy days do you see what i'm saying it's almost like the weather like reverse psychology is me okay i don't know oh [Music] i got a text from my dad earlier [Music] it's been so long since i've had a burrito and it's my favorite food i feel really tired right now for some reason but wow what an experience that was a good burrito the burritos in my hometown are better i actually contemplate going home probably once every two weeks to get a burrito from my hometown sorry to my family that i contemplate going home to get a burrito rather than to see you guys um i know that this is going gonna give me a stomachache but i feel no remorse i can handle it i already feel things cramping up like things are already cramping up um it was worth it [Music] until further notice i will be having problems with my bowel movements and that's just my unfortunate reality

woke up this morning feeling awful it was friday yesterday and i was like you know what i worked hard this week i'm going to celebrate now i feel like [ __ ] i don't think i'm going to leave my house today i feel like recently anytime i stay up past 11 p.m like nothing good ever happens i always regret it i need to just make it a rule moving forward like okay emma you go to bed at 11 and like you have to stick to it i cannot name one good thing that's happened to me after 11 p.m actually ever i love my morning routine that i have going you know i make my coffee i maybe meditate a little bit whatever but if i go out all of that gets [ __ ] up all of that gets [ __ ] up i wake up late i don't want to meditate i end up skipping out on all of my healthy habits what is going on what are you guys doing moral the story is like i refuse to stay up late moving forward like no more staying up late for me i don't want to do it i don't care if there's like a fun opportunity ow ow your paws in my out i don't care if there's like some sort of fun activity like if it's past 11 p.m i'm not going [Music] so [Music] ugh [Music] i forgot a towel [Music] i've been reading the same book for like three months and i haven't finished it yet and i kind of feel guilty like in the beginning i was burning through it and then now i'm not it's still a great book but i'm just not like i'm not i've been getting into painting in art in general a little bit more recently because it's easy you can just kind of sit down and start drawing stuff painting stuff whatever and it's like easy kind of therapeutic i painted something two days ago that i'm actually proud of i'm actually proud of it and i'm so proud of it that i hung it up right there it kind of makes me want to keep making art i had a little bit of success i have a little bit of potential and now i'm like okay wait maybe this can be my thing it won't maybe i'll make this little space by my bed my art wall and i'll put all my favorite paintings and drawings there to remind me to stop going on the internet and to maybe paint instead [Music] so [Music] i've kind of made the decision that i'm i'm not gonna leave the house today at all so i'm gonna try to make the most out of my my day at home [Music] i noticed that when i try to just like draw from my imagination things go really bad what the [ __ ] but if i have like something i'm trying to draw it tends to go a little bit better so maybe i'll try to draw like something maybe i'll try to draw my water cup [Music] i've been thinking about recently how there's all this pressure to like have a life where you do a lot of [ __ ] do you know what i mean like what's so bad about things being simple i'm not saying that like you know you never do anything crazy like you never go on a fun vacation or you never go to a nice dinner i'm just saying that generally like 80 of the time life is just very mundane and boring and that's not necessarily awful it doesn't mean that you're doing something wrong if your life is like that it doesn't mean that your life sucks once i accepted that i enjoy having a more simple life i actually enjoy it a lot more [Music] i'm painting a fish in the wine glass how [ __ ] goofy is that i kind of regret putting him in there it's in fact too late now so i have to make it work [Music] that is my potd painting of the day you know i said i wasn't gonna leave my house today but i'm not gonna lie i feel like i'm gonna be a little bit bummed out if i don't leave the house i need i do need to get out of here um vibes are off i need to get out [Music] i just can't seem to get out of bed today like why do cats do this when cats do this it makes me like very uncomfortable i think it means that he thinks that i'm his mom which is actually like precious but it's just kind of like something about it kind of grosses me out [Music] [Music] what's better than going on a walk in your neighborhood come on everybody give it up in my head when i imagine going on a walk i'm like okay i'm going to see cement i'm going to see like a few trees i'm going to see a few houses and i'm going to go home and like what what did we gain from that but it always ends up being so much nicer than i expect i walked past this parking garage just now that i wanted to go on top of so badly but i feel like i would get the police called on me if i did go in it because it looks very secure like it it they had like security guards and stuff of that sort oh my god there's a cat over there oh the cat is coming toward me stop this could be a come here come here like i know i have cats at home but like i would love to experience a feral random cat right now just went into somebody's front yard i'm extremely oh it's coming back come here look at my little friend you want to say hi he looks exactly like my cat at home named oliver also normally i'd be scared that a random cat on the street would have rabies but this one has like a very exquisite collar which tells me that that cat probably doesn't have rabies listen it's possible the caller may be giving me a false sense of security that cat could fully have fleas and rabies it's too late now what is it about like the clothes that you put on before you go on a walk like when i'm about to go on a walk i put on the weirdest [ __ ] like why have not worn these socks in probably two years this shirt has holes in the armpit okay like i'm wearing biker shirt like what am i wearing whoever owns this little gray kitty is pretty ballsy for letting this cat just like roam around los angeles where people drive like 400 miles an hour and steal things like why would you let your cat roam around oh my god there's a car i don't know what to do i think i'm just gonna stay here as the car drives by hey i wanna kill how do you explain this how the [ __ ] do you explain this i'm going home now i spent the whole day in bed and i mean i feel pretty good about it hey i went on a walk the [ __ ] oh i painted [ __ ] i did things the day after i spend all day in bed i am unstoppable because i'm all rested up like tomorrow's about to be crazy like i'm gonna [ __ ] do some crazy [ __ ] like i might even go to the grocery store tomorrow [Music]

playing drums i hit my head with the sticks it almost sounds like it should be a joke because that's how dumb it is but [Music] [Music] these strawberries look terrible they're actually good balls alarm [Music] let's count just like a how many tubs of spicy hummus does emma have in her refrigerator right now [Music] i just tried to draw um an elephant just from like my imagination um like it's crazy to me how not artistically inclined i am it blows my mind like my own father is an artist that is his passion in life that is his job he's my dad and like that's what [ __ ] happens when i try to draw like i have no artistic instinct um but i'm okay with that because i just enjoy like [Applause] you know doodling things like it doesn't i don't need to be good at it to do it i have this massive box of colored pencils from when i um i don't know i think i bought these when i was taking art class in high school and i still have them listen i might not be great at drawing but i enjoy the sensation of using colored pencils so why not like this is something i painted it's not all about being good at things i'm not good at drawing i'm not good at painting i'm not good at playing drums but i like the sensation of doing it i like doing it i don't need to be good at it to enjoy it [Music] it's terrible but i enjoyed myself so i always decide to come to the beach the same day that i wash my hair like the first thing i did this morning was wash my hair it's all clean it's shiny it looks gorgeous i wouldn't maybe say it looks gorgeous why is there [ __ ] bugs on me it's already august and i have not done [ __ ] i've been watching people going on these tropical vacations and i'm not gonna lie like i am jealous and it just hasn't felt like summer to me but i think that also when you become an adult unfortunately i think summer kind of loses its meaning if i see one more [ __ ] person on my instagram that has a smoothie that's in a pineapple or something like i'm going i'm gonna get in the water but my hair is so clean right now like it doesn't look greasy or oily but i am about to go in the ocean and pack my scalp with salt and sand and i don't care but it is kind of sad it's like these are my final moments with my nice clean hair i'm enjoying it i'm enjoying it the ocean does look delicious today though like it looks [ __ ] delicious sometimes you look at the ocean you're like not interested a few days ago when i was at the beach there was a tiger shark in the water is that what it's called there's some sort of harmless harmless shark in the water supposedly they don't attack humans but i'm like okay like maybe not usually but like what if this time anyway last time i was at the beach there was a shark so like i mean i definitely have a little bit more anxiety about getting in than normal but supposedly the type of shark was harmless i just have a hard time believing any sharks are harmless i feel like with any shark there's a chance that they're going to think that your foot is a flounder or something and then they're going to want to take a nibble and i can't blame them i'm in their habitat i'm in their world i'm walking into their house so if they want to take a little nibble out of my foot i can't say anything if somebody [ __ ] came into my house uninvited and they looked like a jar of peanut butter i would take a spoon to them and [ __ ] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] i do not know why people don't like going to the beach when it's overcast because i think it's so much better you don't have to wear sunglasses because it's like the clouds are protecting your eyes so you don't need to wear sunglasses that's great recently i've been not able to stop eating strawberries like i can't stop eating them i eat probably one carton a day sometimes two i think they're in season or something because i either that or my taste buds are evolving and now i just like have a special appreciation for strawberries but they're so good right now also ever since my strawberry obsession has started i feel like my experience every day pooping is just like 10 times better i've been extremely regular [Music] let me show you something sad why did i do that wait i like it better wait i just fixed my problem my hair is very wait i literally have a ball my hair is so short i mean i kind of fixed my problem though because my problem was that my hair was so uneven in the back that i couldn't wear my hair down because it looked there was a u-shape it was like a u-shape i bleached my hair a few months back well i actually i was like platinum blonde for like eight months and i kept bleaching my hair over and over and over again and my hair is relatively fragile so eventually all hell broke loose and my hair basically got fried off and in the back of my head things got really [ __ ] up because i lay down a lot you know the hairs in the back broke and got really short and so now all the hairs in the back of my head are really short as you can see and it makes things very awkward should i just like cut bangs while i'm at it like oh [ __ ] i think i'm making things worse okay let's just stop let's stop i kind of want to cut bangs stop i've never cut my own hair before i feel like it kind of went okay if i keep doing touch-ups i'm going to end up with no hair left okay now we're doing bad things now we need to stop no more of this no more of this why why can i not stop okay i need to stop i actually need to stop this is getting bad this is like out of control now my hair is so short wait i kind of like it though can it even fit in a ponytail no okay okay so i just like cut bangs right now stop don't wait what if i just did a little bit okay but what if i did bangs not like all the way but like what if i just did a little what's the worst that could happen it grows back my hair is already [ __ ] up no that's ugly okay okay [Music] okay i actually need to [ __ ] stop [Music]
e4tGyBaL_Q8,alterations,my “break” ended early,2021-08-11T16:05:22Z,324425,5869228,14673,[ __ ] [Music] it feels very balmy today [Music] i was gonna meditate outside but if i'm being honest my towel was wet and it was soaking through my pants i also forgot my phone and i need my phone to meditate because i do guided meditations if i just sit down for 10 minutes and close my eyes and try to focus on my breathing i will not stay focused and i will think about what it would be like if i got in a car crash or what would happen if i broke a bone or what would happen if one of my cats got hit by a car i like to put a blanket around me when i meditate so that i'm nice and warm and cozy and i feel like i'm in a cocoon [Music] [Music] this morning we're making an omelette i'm really picky about what goes in my omelets because i get grossed out i can't eat spinach in an omelette because it's like stringy and chewy and gross it's so gross the last few days when i've made omelettes they've looked bad they've looked genuinely ugly it's kind of more like an egg pancake and i it's definitely burnt so i am the worst with avocados because i buy avocados and then i never use them at the right time and then they all go bad i i don't think i've cracked open like a perfectly ripe avocado in six months every time i open one up it's like a little rotten and i eat it anyway but let's see if i have any successful avocados today you guys are [ __ ] good luck i'm not complaining like this is great it looks like toddler made it but my mission for today is that i don't have any pairs of pants that i really truly love because none of them really truly fit me properly except for my jeans but all my other pants like there's always something wrong they're too long they're too short they're not proportional like something's always wrong with these pants i decided today that enough is enough and i'm gonna go get a bunch of a bunch of pairs of pants altered this always happens i always drop [ __ ] on this robe this robe is constantly dirty i should not have a white robe [Music] this is what i went into my closet and picked out today okay that so but i like it like there's something about this that i like i also have gas it seemed like i got gas immediately when i put these pants on like i did not have gas this morning so i'm wondering if like my body is sending me signals saying emma maybe you shouldn't [Music] [ __ ] am i wearing right now what the [ __ ] this isn't an outfit that no one's gonna see i'm going to do my daily errands right now in this [ __ ] outfit this isn't like a joke like i'm i'm going out in the world like this i mean if you really think about how often you buy clothes and it doesn't fit perfectly i mean it's pretty much 90 of the time especially with pants because listen i do not have an ass okay so in majority of pants it's like saggy city in my in my butt region you know i want to show you something [Music] right i don't know what it is about the stage in life that i'm in but it really doesn't take much to make my day the people in there were just so nice i don't know i just like liked hanging out with it maybe i lack a certain level of social interaction i don't know something about it was just weirdly heartwarming but now i'm getting coffee because i'm can i do a iced almond macadamia latte with an extra shot of espresso holy [ __ ] holy actual [ __ ] okay i need to go to the grocery store i'm kind of enjoying my grand day out and my weird outfit it's good holy [ __ ] my forehead is sweating listen i love wearing the hat but like it's hot it's too hot like my i'm getting forehead sweat next level forehead sweat it's not feeling good it's not feeling hot actually it is feeling hot but it's not feeling like hot it's feeling like hot and listen as much as i love feeling hot i don't like feeling hot do the math but i also look way better with the hat on so i'm going to leave it on this outfit without the hat a [ __ ] train wreck i mean it's already a train wreck but if i was not wearing this hat it would be like a major train wreck like really bad oh my god i parked so i parked so badly there's the like did i get a ticket oh my god parking enforcement is right there literally speeding away i didn't get a parking ticket until i moved to l.a i moved to la and then i got probably 30 parking tickets within the first year of living here and then since then i mean the number has just grown exponentially like i i'm probably i've probably gotten 60 parking tickets i think i might have gotten out of this one because i don't have a parking ticket so they must not have caught me because i did not pay for parking let's not be mistaken here i did not pay for parking um [Music] do [Music] [Music] these strawberries taste like [ __ ] [Music] [Music] so so [Applause] i was really angry at the grocery store today because i went to get mini cucumbers because i like them in my salads they only had the big cucumbers so i had to settle they're not the same the mini cucumbers taste better i hate i hate these cucumbers many cucumbers are like a force of nature like they're so good you know i'm sorry about what i said about the cucumbers earlier these are [ __ ] fine they're pretty much the exact same it's not as good as a mini cucumber [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm in a moment of debate within my own mind right now i'm trying to decide if i want to go on a late night adventure or if i want my late night adventure to be in my bed the sun's about to go down this is my favorite time of day when like the sun's going down and it's warm out and it's the summertime i'm kind of in the mood to go to a party which never happens not only does it never happen but every time i go to a party i hate it so i don't know why i'm desiring a party right now because it's like am i sweetheart you know better you know better okay sometimes i'm in the mood see it's so confusing like i confuse myself because i can't tell if i'm an introvert or an extrovert sometimes being social recharges me and then sometimes it drains me beyond belief [Music] spicy penne in bed i cook this perfectly it's perfectly al dente and this never happens i always either overcook my pasta or undercook it it just feels good to do something right every once in a while this is the life i feel like i want to go on an adventure but i don't know what that means like i don't know what that means where am i going to go right now it's a wednesday i don't give a [ __ ] i do not literally there's so many different types of parmesan cheese there's like grated which is what i always choose but then there's also the parmesan shred or um like slices almost what's that called grated not well it's not grated because that's grated in slices okay there's that kind and then there's like the fake parmesan cheese that's like like uh like almost like little dippin dots anyway the moral of what i'm trying to say is here is that [Music] you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-07-25T16:53:16Z,230067,4530604,5149,hi [Music] i have been in the spot in bed all day it's 5 p.m i'm still here like i didn't even get up to shower this morning nothing happened i've been in this spot all day and i've had no motivation to do anything until now i was laying in bed as you can see here i started to think about what i wanted to eat and for some reason a peanut butter and jelly sandwich just kept coming to the forefront of my brain i realized that i was craving a peanut butter and jelly sandwich which hasn't happened in a long time although i do absolutely love it i haven't eaten a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in probably five years if i'm being honest but unfortunately because peanut butter and jellies are not a part of my day-to-day life i don't have bread for peanut butter and jelly and i don't have jelly for peanut butter and jelly readily available in my fridge which got me thinking even more what if i made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich from scratch i'm talking about i make the bread from scratch i'm talking about i make the jelly from scratch i'm talking about i make the peanut butter from scratch i'm also going to buy bread and jelly just in case i fail i'm not relying on myself today i don't necessarily trust myself especially when it comes to baking bread i really don't know how that's gonna go but i mean i'm excited to find out this could be this could be really fun this could become my new thing i feel like homemade peanut butter and jelly would be so good because it's already so good but if it was homemade i feel like it would be even like 10 times better so hi that's what we're doing today we're going to make a homemade peanut butter and jelly it's going to be an adventure whether it goes good or bad it's gonna be an adventure all right let's go to the grocery store you can just tell i've been in bed all day because my shirt is not supposed to be a v-neck and also my hair i just look oily i just hope that when i'm at the grocery store people think wow she's glowing and not wow she has a thin layer of sweat all over her body from being in bed all day this is why i don't drink sparkling waters i've been in kind of a cooking rut recently because i've gotten into the habit of cooking the same like five or six things every week no not even five or six more like two or three okay sorry i'm a liar i have gotten into a routine of cooking the same few things every week and i don't really stray away from that and that's not good i really enjoy cooking and i like the experience of cooking something new you know today we're gonna do it and it'll feel great okay i have this whole dilemma in my day-to-day life and it relates to watching movies reading books and cooking things that i generally well i'm not the biggest movie person but i do love books and i do love cooking the thing that stops me and i sometimes like movies every time i try to start a book movie or new recipe i have the same dilemma what is that dilemma you may ask i get anxious before i begin one of these activities because i'm so frightened that i'm going to hate it and that it's going to be a waste of my time and then i'm gonna have to start a new recipe i'm gonna have to start a new book i'm gonna have to start a new movie and then even if i do that there's a chance i'll hate the next one and the next thing you know i wasted all this time trying to find one that i like does that make sense once i find a recipe i like i just cook it over and over and over and over and over again because i know it'll never fail me i know i'll never be disappointed and i know that my time going into cooking that specific food will always be a good use of my time i'm not super into being spontaneous and that's not something i'm necessarily going to fight because that's me that's me baby i feel a little bit nasty which is not my favorite feeling i don't like it i don't like it when i was younger i used to feel so comfortable feeling kind of nasty a little stinky a little gross but now that i'm older i can't tolerate it as much i i feel gross i'm growing up i say that in every video shut up emma shut up find something new to say queen stop making the same [ __ ] stupid jokes if that could even be considered a joke because it's not funny and i know none of you laughed either i swear to god i haven't even been on the internet for that long i think i've been making youtube videos i've been making content for the internet for what four years okay so no more carbonated drinks for me we're just gonna never do that again although for now i'm not going to waste this so i will continue to drink it and burp but moving forward do not allow me to have carbonated drinks absolutely destroy me in the comments if i drink a carbonated drink because guess what you are being directly affected by the fact that i'm drinking this carbonated drink i'm burping and you have to listen to it that's not fun or something that you thought you were signing up for i'm not faking it either like i wish that this was a joke i wish i was not burping this much when i drink carbonated drinks with a straw they don't make me burp but when i drink them out of a can they make me burn scientists everywhere calling scientists everywhere explain that scientists stop what you're doing that's important and answer my question that was a joke and you know what i don't want anybody to get angry at me for that joke so i'm out of here before i just dig myself deeper into a hole ah that was successful and relatively easy i just got this credit karma visa debit card and all of a sudden something as small as picking up baking ingredients can be the biggest part of my day credit karma money offers this cool thing called instant karma which means that you could get reimbursed for a purchase that you make a free peanut butter and jelly incredible but reimbursements can be big up to five thousand dollars i use my card every day to see if i can get reimbursed thank you to credit karma money for sponsoring this video now it's time to go home and make this [ __ ] peanut butter and jelly i wonder if this song's copyrighted peanut butter is that copyrighted like does somebody own the rights to that i really hope not if i get a copyright email about me just saying that just now i am i'm quitting no i'm not quitting guys i would never leave you but no um i'm just as grossed out as you are i just want to be raw and real with you guys even making that joke just made me cringe i hate i hate that run real i just want to be run real with you guys shut up i'm feeling angsty today maybe my period's coming it's not actually i don't think it is so this is just natural this is all this is the real raw and real me let's literally do this i'm ready like i am so ready we're starting with the bread because i feel like the bread is going to take the longest normally making bread is extremely complicated like you have to let it rise and you have to put yeast in it and all that stuff i was like not literally not today so instead i'm making bread that does not require all of that labor i'm making a gluten-free bread so that it doesn't hurt my stomach so i'm adding a cup and a fourth of almond flour should i just like do a speed round and see how quickly i can do this okay that's not necessary let's not do that next i'm adding gluten-free flour what's in it nobody knows a cup and a fourth there's the fourth oh see this is why you don't rush things because there's still some left in there i need to just take my time and enjoy this this bread recipe is so easy that it almost seems too good to be true which is kind of frightening to me why is this so easy there must be a catch adding oat flour now three-fourths of a cup one day i want to make sourdough bread that's like on my bucket list but my god is that complicated baking powder that's a lot that freaks me out that's a lot i don't trust myself like the way that i just measured out a fourth of a teaspoon of baking powder soda baking soda like that was frightening salt almond milk i really need to make sure i'm actually reading this because i have a tendency to read things too quickly and then like [ __ ] the whole thing up apple cider vinegar okay you guys the batter is done check me out check me out that was quick that was under five minutes wait this could be a thing for me because i don't like when a recipe takes me too long so if something's like quick and efficient i mean look everybody look should i speed it up a little bit okay that was fun should i try a bite of the dough it's vegan so it's like doesn't matter okay it tastes like nothing which might be a good thing that might actually be a good thing i bought this specifically to make bread so my dreams are coming true okay i'll cross that bridge when i get to it i mean this seems easy enough like look how easy that was ah okay this is where things go wrong got it i knew things were gonna go wrong it was more like a matter of time like when is it gonna happen what i'm really excited to make more than anything is the peanut butter like my favorite food is peanut butter which might sound weird it's like oh well that's a condiment not for me i was thinking maybe i garnish it with sesame seeds i love sesame seed bread do i even own sesame seeds i do stop okay wait this is actually awesome okay this kind of looks gorgeous honestly i'm pressing it down with my hand which might sound gross but i feel like it's fine because my hands are clean every time i'm like my hands are clean don't worry guys i could be lying and to be honest i am this looks gorgeous and so easy so i'm gonna pop this in the oven now for 40 minutes and then we're gonna get started on the other stuff first order of business is the peanut butter because hello also i think the ac is broken in my home right now because it is a thousand degrees do i look yeah i look damp i'm going to try to use a blender to make this this might go terribly wrong i also don't have a recipe so again things could go wrong so i'm taking some dry roasted peanuts i love peanuts i'm gonna add a little pinch of salt now this is a secret ingredient i'm gonna add a little bit of coconut oil this is liquid coconut oil because i feel like this will make it a little oilier i'm gonna add vanilla and then here's the secret ingredient i just soaked some dates for like i don't know an hour and i feel like that's gonna make it taste so good cinnamon not a decent amount okay now we blend and like that was again too easy why is it so easy why is it so easy that's frightening it's not going as planned in the blender um wait it [ __ ] looks and smells so good i feel like if i add a little bit more coconut oil maybe that will help it smells out of this oh out of this world should i try a little bit no not yet no impatience with me okay guys i honestly think i did an amazing job stop it does look like poop but that's only because i have the brain of a seven-year-old that's the best thing i've ever eaten i could eat this whole thing right now but i have to save it for my pb j but holy [ __ ] you guys what a success my god i'm so proud of myself hey please don't judge me right now but i'm going to put it in a mug to store it you guys i'm actually sweating bullets for some reason i think my ac is broken the show must go on i'm not letting one speck of this go to waste like i none of this will go down the drain i feel reborn peanut butter being set aside now we have to make the jelly this is going pretty well like this is pretty promising so far i'm a little scared about the bread should we check on it what do you want oh they want me to feed them sorry mommy was infatuated by the idea of making a homemade peanut butter and jelly and forgot to feed you oh my god it's literally not even past your your dinner time like it's early like we're 20 minutes early i usually feed you at 6 30 sweethearts like what's going on you guys to be honest i can't really see it so it could be going really good or really bad i don't know i can't see it that's okay we're gonna add raspberries to a pan why am i not washing them may you ask cause today's not that kind of day next i'm adding some fresh lemon juice completely forgot to feed the cats just now even though it's not even their dinner time yet like they just like to do this like i swear i'm a great cat mom i'm even wearing a shirt about a cat right now so you can't say i'm not a good cat cat mom i'm making raspberry jam because i honestly like it the best i will eat any peanut butter and jelly and not complain like it's one of my favorite foods it could have toenails in it and i would gladly eat it i just added the juice of two lemons i'm kind of eyeballing this recipe because i just i'm kind of getting a little lazy if i'm being honest that's the problem with me in cooking i just get lazy too quick i'm gonna add literally a random amount of sugar i'm just gonna start stabbing it and breaking it up a little bit oh not a little bit smells amazing so that's a good sign here's what it looks like so now that i've dissolved the sugar i'm supposed to boil this mixture y'all i'm sweating am i sweating because i'm working in the kitchen and that's just like sweat inducing or am i sweating because my ac is broken or am i sweating because i'm nervous while this is coming to a boil we can feed the cats because they are just not having it their water literally like gets food in it after one day like how is there food in it already like i literally filled this up this morning and there's food in it and like cat litter how do they get cat litter in there explain that are you guys happy oh no okay did it start boiling yes so i need to set a timer this all happened very quickly i'm feeling very very out of control right now my orange cat declan has been doing this thing every morning he wakes me up by pushing everything on my nightstand off my nightstand onto the floor that includes my phone my glass of water that i have by my bed all of the above and it has been terrible it's been a terrible experience i don't like the phase that he's going through right now it's very rebellious and angsty and weird this oh this smells really good though let's do a time lapse of me cleaning my kitchen because i feel like that would be fun that was very productive it's bubbling very violently which is just kind of scary to me like i feel like i'm burning it am i burning it like i don't know it smells good it kind of smells like it's burning though okay i'm taking it off the heat okay so apparently i let it sit for a second and then i put it in the fridge unfortunately i don't have a clean jar so i'm just gonna attempt to pour it in here okay that one great that little oh look how gorgeous she is wow wow i mean it tastes great we're two for two ow yeah emma maybe you don't pick that up i mean so far two out of the three ingredients are absolutely amazing i just want to eat this whole peanut butter right now but alas we will wait and be patient i will see you in approximately 10 minutes when the bread is done in the meantime i'm gonna shove my finger in this peanut butter thing you know what while this bread is finishing baking i'm gonna go take a shower because i smell like dookie so i'm gonna go shower and i'll see you when bread is done and i'm showered because i just like feel nasty right now i mean can you tell i did not shower because i was too excited so let's just assemble we have our peanut butter and jelly our loaf of bread which honestly kind of looks good i mean it's a little bit flat but it kind of looks good oh it's so doughy okay okay i'm excited let me try the bread by itself it doesn't taste like anything which i guess is a good thing it's had a big slab of our peanut butter now we add a gorgeous spoonful of our jelly it looks kind of amazing i put like half a jar of peanut butter on just one peanut butter and jelly because as we know i don't [ __ ] around okay let's try it okay the lighting sucks and like i want the lighting to be perfect for this moment okay here's me and my peanut butter and jelly everything tastes good enough on its own so let's give it a go let's see let's see i'm nervous oh it's so good yes that was like the most successful thing i've ever done sorry i'm posing for a thumbnail it's definitely made my day i feel good i feel really good right now i'm gonna eat this i'm gonna take a shower and that's all she wrote thank you for joining me on my random spontaneous peanut butter and jelly journey i love you guys always and i appreciate you very much and here's your forehead kiss i'll see you soon cheers that was corny that was genuinely corny like why'd i do that cheers what the [ __ ] was that

-emma chamberlain",2021-07-18T18:05:43Z,229647,5215709,6520,hi everybody this video was sponsored by lululemon i'm doing something kind of crazy today i'm a little bit frightened also i dyed my eyebrows the other day it's a really long story they look really bushy and dark ignore that it's just like let's just act like it's not happening maybe you didn't even notice today i'm going to try to run a marathon with no training why am i doing this well i'm doing this because i know that okay actually i don't know why am i doing this well recently i've been getting into running i've been running a few times a week i just want to see what i'm capable of for no reason other than just why not like there's no real reason for why i'm doing this it's just kind of like why not a marathon is technically 26.2 miles am i going to be able to run 26.2 miles i can almost guarantee you that that won't happen but i'm gonna try to get as close to 26 miles as i can and that's today's video we're just gonna see how far i can run you know what they say shoot for the stars no wait shoot for the moon and even if you miss you will land among the stars that is how i feel about trying to run a marathon i have not prepared at all i just woke up this morning and made a coffee i don't know what i'm doing i did not train at all like i don't know what i'm doing so the likelihood of me being able to succeed at a full 26 miles is slim but we're just gonna see how far i can go regardless maybe if i end up enjoying it i will actually start training for a marathon although i don't know if i love running that much but regardless that's what we're doing today before i start getting ready to leave for my run this video is sponsored by lululemon every feature lululemon designs every fabric that lululemon creates every sensation that they engineer is all created with one purpose and that purpose is to unlock your full potential which is very relevant with today's video because i'm really gonna try to unlock my full running potential today there's so much research that goes into even the smallest features called the science of feel that really sets lululemon apart and makes them them so first i'm gonna show you what i'm wearing for my run the energy bra it's lululemon's most versatile bra the luck stream fabric is sweat wicking has a four-way stretch is breathable and feels slick and there's no friction i think this is a perfect bra for running that's why i'm wearing it today on my run all of those features support the act of running perfectly especially sweat wicking i'm a very sweaty person so i'm grateful for that feature i'm also wearing the lululemon fast and free leggings the new looks fabric has weightless coverage has an engineered four-way stretch is sweat wicking quick drying breathable and is very cool and sleek it comes in high rise and super high rise and it comes in sizes zero to twenty and you can also get different inseam lengths they have 25 inches 28 inches and 31 inches the inseam is basically how long it is there's two side pockets in here and five waistband pockets and a continuous draw cord but for after my run when i'm stretching relaxing let me show you what i'm gonna be wearing for after my run i'm going to be wearing the cloud bra and the align leggings it feels like you're wearing next to nothing they're distraction free they have even support all because of the new loo fabric there's minimal design lines the leica cloud bra is so incredibly comfortable it has molded foam cups that are lightweight breathable malleable very comfortable and it has light support for light impact activities but that was my little lululemon haul shop now at lululemon.com thank you again to lululemon for sponsoring this video now let's get running so i did do a little bit of research on running a marathon and it sounds like you need to be fueling yourself throughout your run so i thought i would bring myself a snack i don't know what i'm doing i was thinking dates with peanut butter dates have glucose which is sugar which helps fuel you when you're exercising do i know what i'm talking about not really peanut butter put it inside of the date push it together a little dating peanut butter sandwich running after eating for me is not good i'm frightened to eat breakfast this morning because i don't want that to affect my run so i'm going to just bring this as a snack whenever i run after i eat it starts to like come up my esophagus anyway so we have a snack next we're going to be bringing a water i'm nervous i have an energy drink here i have my water i also brought for after my run a coconut water because coconut water has electrolytes in it which help replenish the electrolytes in your body that get lost when you sweat a lot of yadda yadda whatever okay i didn't think i would be nervous for this but i'm genuinely like frightened let me give you a background on my experience with running to start so i did a little bit of running in high school which would make you think like oh emma you're gonna be great at this no because i was terrible i don't think i've ever ran more than four and a half miles a few times a week i've been running two and a half three and a half miles i'm learning to love it like truly 26 miles is not an easy feat we will see what my willpower is like today whether or not i can push through the pain because it's inevitable that this is going to be difficult i do not think there's a world where i'm going to run 26 miles but i don't know we're just gonna see we'll see what happens i mean we'll just simply have to see what happens like i don't know i'm driving to the beach i decided i wanted to run by the beach which it might be kind of cold out so i did not think about that i've always envied people who get runners high all the time runner's high is basically when you run for so long that you start to feel euphoric and happy or whatever i've always envied people who experience that but maybe today i'm not there yet but i really have to go to the bathroom so i just stopped at a grocery store i'm gonna pick up some i think i want to eat sushi after i'm done so while i'm in the grocery store to use the restroom i'm also going to get some sushi is it gross that it's going to sit in my car a little bit but i don't care i i think i literally have to go to the bathroom not because i actually have to go to the bathroom but because i'm genuinely so nervous i'm so nervous i'm gonna go sit on the toilet now okay i successfully used the bathroom but i did not successfully get sushi because apparently the grocery store doesn't put their sushi out until afternoon and i did forget that it is 8 30 in the morning so yeah we're not getting sushi right now maybe i'll get it later maybe not but my dreams were crushed i'm so nervous i'm why am i so nervous like i'm like listen i'm here's my mantra right here's my like philosophy with this whole thing i'm like i'm just gonna do the best that i can if i run more than four miles i'll be happy that's not true i want to run like 10 miles minimum shoot for the moon because if you miss you still land amongst the stars we can do this i have arrived my nail broke i don't want to talk about it i got them done yesterday i am heartbroken right now i literally got them done yesterday and one already broke i'm honestly i'm just gonna stretch and then get started i mean i don't know i i don't know what else to do i don't know how else to prepare like i'm just gonna do it there's nothing left to do it's time to go it's time to go everybody i'm a mile in i'm scared two miles i'm tired i'm at three miles it's not getting easier i'm at four miles i'm taking a walking break to update you guys not because i'm dying or anything this is so much harder than i expected i'm glad that i tried it but i don't think i realized what running this distance felt like like even four miles like i'm ready for bed five miles i'm so done i'm so bad i feel terrible i really thought you could do this without training not the case hit six miles and i'm done my body said emma not today my body is not happening having it happening it i had to walk like a mile back to my car but this has been the best walk i've ever taken like i just feel incredible oh my god why was that so hard i did bad i did really bad oh my god look at my snack okay well for one i'm gonna drink some coconut water i'm going to like listen i'm going to clickbait the video and say running a marathon with no training because that was the concept of the video but listen i did not run even cl i didn't even run a half marathon i ran six miles and then walked another mile so that's seven miles total a marathon is 26 miles a half marathon is 13 miles i ran a fourth of a marathon okay i didn't realize like the amount of training it takes to run long distance you can't just wake up one day and run 10 miles i didn't know that i did just get a piece of peanut butter in my throat i'm having a rough time right now i've never been somebody who can naturally long distance run ever even when i did cross country in school i was it was the worst thing ever like i was so bad at it so i'm not shocked at how much of a fail this was but it was fun to try like listen i thought i could define nature defy science and just run 26 miles but that's just not the case oh my god i'm so tired it was fun though it was a fun experiment i think what i would do differently next time is number one i would run at a different time like i would eat breakfast then go for my run because i think my first problem was that i tried to run on an empty stomach bad idea don't do that i also should have hydrated more last night and drank more water did not drink enough water last night or ever for that matter i don't drink a lot of water definitely should have stretched more oh i also went for a jog yesterday because i thought maybe that would help i actually just think that that made me get tired even quicker also i ran at like 5 p.m so it hasn't even been 24 hours since the last time that i went for a job that was stupid i just did not prepare regardless it was an experience this just truly made me appreciate people who run long distances and really admire people who run long distances if you can run 10 miles i don't know how you do it i need to go home i thought i was going to leave the beach immediately but i decided to just sit in my car with the ac on and look out at the ocean and just reflect and the moral of the story is the moral of this video is that failure is not a bad thing like listen did i technically fail at my goal today yes did i fail miserably some might say that i'm not going to be angry at myself i'm not going to beat myself up about it i'm not going to not post this video because my body was not feeling it was it technically a failure sure but it wasn't because guess what i ran probably more than i've ever run before i never i don't think i've ever run more than what four miles five miles max like this was a first for me i have a new found respect for people who have the endurance to run long distances i got to hang out by the beach listen this was not a failure this was a failure but it wasn't i think from this experience i learned that i actually don't ever want to run a marathon regardless it was it was a good day but i do need to go home now and stretch and have a relaxing and pleasant remainder to my day it's not only that it takes physical training but it also takes mental training you know what i mean like when i exercise it's always like more leisurely like comfortable it's never like uncomfortable i'm never pushing myself too far out of my comfort zone and i think i prefer that i think that's how i like exercise to be i don't like it to be painful i think that this taught me a lot about me and my personal fitness goals my personal fitness goals are to get a nice sweat in but have a good time running a marathon is not a good time i'm gonna go home i'll yeah i'll see you when i get home i am very excited to get in there right now i'm out of the shower i'm in my comfy stretchy aligned pant and cloud bra i'm not gonna lie i am exhausted i really didn't expect that to take as much of a toll on me i need to go get my nail fixed because my nail broke and i'm literally going on vacation tomorrow and i got these done yesterday for my trip i was thinking about going to the grocery store on the way home but i was like i think i smell bad i just sweat maybe a little bit too much to go in public so now i'm all showered i'm gonna go get sushi i also need to stretch those are the next activities i'm so excited to get sushi ow [Music] i'm gonna go get sushi now can you believe this i literally got these done at 8 pm last night they lasted 12 hours literally on my way to sushi right now i go through different phases with food i'll have a favorite food for like sometimes up to six months and then one day i will hate it and my favorite food for a while there was a specific salad it was kale and beans and avocado and seeds and like this delicious dressing i don't know what was in it that was my favorite food which sounds dumb but like i i loved it i was obsessed with it my greatest joy in life why is it so good why do i get so much joy from this okay but one day hit and i didn't like it anymore so my new food is sushi explain it somebody explain it i don't know what clicks in my brain and what changes my mind but like right now i'm in a sushi mood i don't think i'm ever gonna get sick of hummus i've been eating hummus every day for like over a year i'm not sick of it yet i love it so much anyway moral the story is i'm on a sushi phase right now who knows what's next hi um can i make an appointment for today for an acrylic fill all right yeah we'll see you uh uh okay great thank you nail appointment secured everything's coming together how have i managed to do all this before 2 pm i don't know sushi hall i'm so excited this sauce it's like chili garlic sauce wow there's something so sacred about eating in your car like it never gets old for me like i'll always love it um what a day i just arrived at my nail appointment imagine me in a nail appointment imagine me in my nail because imagine i need my hair i'm trying to hypnotize you into imagining me in my nail appointment imagine in my nail imagine me in my nail appointment [Music] did you guys hear that it was literally not a fart i swear so hey guys not only am i at home in bed with nails done i also have a coffee wow what a day what a day you know there were some rough moments i failed at my marathon my nail broke but there were some good things about today i got to eat sushi i still went on a nice long run i actually prefer the navy blue nails more than the green nails i had so that's nice feels really good to lay in bed though my body already is getting sore the other thing is that i didn't realize is that i was running on pavement i normally run on a treadmill and treadmills are so much softer to run on so i think that's another reason why i was struggling so bad because i was running on pavement and i never do that i'm kind of sore it's a lovely evening i'm sitting outside i'm enjoying the ambiance of the evening i just wanted to thank you for hanging out with me today we had a little bit of fun we had a little bit of failure we did it all today here's your forehead kiss i love you guys thanks for hanging out with me today i can't wait to hang out with you guys again next week and then the week after that and then the week after that and then the week after that once again this video is sponsored by lululemon thank you to lululemon for sponsoring this video i'm wearing your comfy outfit right now i love it and i'll see you guys around goodbye [Music] you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-07-11T17:34:33Z,237249,4600742,5493,good morning [Music] to start this video I am going to talk about the book I'm reading the book I'm reading is the razor razor is the razor's Edge by W Somerset mom mom close enough in this book there is a character named Elliot Elliot is kind of this pretentious very snobby yet social and kind of generous person although I do not admire Elliot's more negative personality traits like his snobbiness and stuff like that I was inspired by the way that he threw parties he just invites people over sets up cheese boards and sets up wine stations and I was really inspired by this because I've never been somebody to host parties I've never been somebody to host things usually I'm somebody who's in attendance I attend things but for the last two weekends every Saturday I've been doing a pool party I get a bunch of food I set up all the sunscreen all the towels I do the whole thing and I just invite over random people not like random but like sometimes people I don't really know that well sometimes people I know really well and I just invite a bunch of people and today is Saturday and I'm doing it again I'm having another pool party and so in today's video I'm going to show you how to set up a great party it's approximately 8 am I am having a pool party at 2PM it's time to set up step one is to assess what food I have I'd never like to just go to the grocery store blind right I like to go to the grocery store knowing what I have for example like I have a bunch of chocolate and truffles they got sent to my house and I do not know where they came from but I have a bunch of Truffles and stuff right and I know that people like stuff like that so I'm gonna put those out so I'm gonna put out one pack of truffles more chocolates check it out I already had these although the problem with these is that like you never know what you're eating so you'll like take a bite of one and be like ew this one sucks and then you just keep doing that until you're halfway through the box and you hated all of the ones that you took a bite out of anyways regardless putting these out there you go now I already have my sweet treat already decided and I didn't even have to go out and buy anything so now I know I'm not gonna need to go out and get some sort of dessert because I already had chocolates what if I like put them out on like a wood board no I don't know maybe maybe I'll integrate grate them into my cheese board because I am going to be making a cheese board today cheese board is mandatory okay I don't really have much produce in my fridge so I'm gonna need to buy lots of like fruits and stuff that is noted I don't have any cheese see if I have any like chips oh okay do have some chips I have some hint of lime these are the best chips oh Cheez-Its honestly okay so like the thing is am I buying these snacks for me or am I buying these snacks for everybody else because so far all the snacks that I pulled out are like things that I like I also have some gluten free um tortilla chips it's good to have options for people you never know you know what their situation is so you want to have gluten-free stuff you want to have some dairy free options as well I also have some pita chips so now look I already have look at what I already have so now I can build off of what I already have that is not a lot though like we need to do a lot we have a lot to do let's see if I have any I'm definitely making a charcoal reward today so let's see if I've anything okay I do have this honey oh my God I have more chips more tortilla chips I also have popcorn but I kind of like that popcorn too much to let everybody else eat it and I don't know if that makes me a bad host or if that just makes me if that's just like an act of self-care I don't know okay when it comes to cheeseboard I really have nothing I have no ingredients so I'm gonna have to start from scratch with that so now that I've assessed what I have I need to pick out my outfit before I show you my outfit options I must tell you that all the outfits are from Princess Paulie and Princess Paulie is actually the sponsor of today's video so thank you princess Paulie to sponsoring this video all of these outfits are from there let me show you my options number one cute this one's also cute this one's very cute simple comfortable I'm obsessed with these boots this one might be my favorite actually it's simple it's cute it's my favorite colors these are literally my favorite colors I'm really leaning towards this one I love this outfit but I feel like this is more dinner party vibes so I'm going to save this for the next time I have a dinner party although I do absolutely love this oh my God these pants are [ __ ] amazing I loved all of those outfits but I did choose the one with the brown shirt and the mint green skirt just because I feel like that matches the vibe the best although all of Princess Paulie's clothes are gray trendy fun comfortable check the link in my description to shop on princess Polly and use my code Emma for 20 off your purchase site-wide baby do a little shopping spree follow your dreams but now I need to go to the grocery store I'm on my way to the grocery store [ __ ] the lighting is so bad okay I'm gonna wait till the wedding gets good now it's dark like what the [ __ ] okay there we go so I'm going to the grocery store I might end up having to go to multiple grocery stores because I feel like they never have everything I needed just one the key is that you want to have a diverse selection of snacks okay you want to have some stuff that's like classy like you know the chocolates that I put out and the charcuterie board like all of that that's classy right but then you also want to have some fun stuff like you want to have Cheez-Its and things of that sort you know I think a lot of people avoid hosting events you know because they're like ah but I don't want to clean up afterwards weirdly enough personally I enjoy cleaning up the next day there's pretty much nothing about hosting little parties that I don't like which is crazy because I usually can find a flaw in just about anything actually I think there is one flaw that I have so far like you never know if it's gonna be a success like what if everybody's busy nobody shows up that's the thing that sucks maybe it's me again I mean as I'm growing older I'm starting to enjoy the kind of motherly things maybe that's why I'm now getting into hosting because it's a very mom thing to do but I've been thinking about it recently and when I'm older when I'm like 40 my kids birthday parties are going to be absolutely Buck Wild for one and for two I'm gonna literally throw Super Bowl parties even though I don't watch the Super Bowl I'm so excited to have a child just so that I can do a crazy birthday party for them like this [ __ ] just brings me [ __ ] Joy like no other oh my God nobody's here this is why waking up early is the joy of my life because it's 9 30 in the morning and nobody's at Whole Foods like I am I literally the whole place to myself like it's [ __ ] amazing did I possibly get too much stuff yes like I do not know how many people are coming and I just got enough food for cheese and I just got enough food for probably 20 people so hoping for a good turnout today or else um I'm gonna have an absurd amount of cheese and fruits and vegetables in my fridge people are going to start showing up in approximately four hours oh my God I have so much time [Music] things are looking good we have all the food that we need more than enough food I'm not going to start preparing the food for a little bit because you want the food to be as fresh as possible so I'm going to set up some things that are not food related towels sunscreen so I like to set up a little drink station where I have fresh lemons and limes I also have an ice bucket but I'm not gonna fill that yet because it's just not time okay there we go we have lemons and limes gorgeous some cups yes they are red cups because this is going to be literally the craziest pool party ever and it's not because um I just don't want anybody to break my glass cups it's not because of that it's because I I'm having a litty party so that's why I'm using bread cups check it out foreign drop dead gorgeous is there anything else I can do right now I don't think so I think I'm good for now okay I'm gonna go lay in bed for like an hour I'll see you in an hour it is time to start assembling everything here's what I'm thinking I'm thinking I do a vegan cheese board here and then a regular cheese board on here the first step to making a cheese board don't look at the back of my head so I'm going to start with the vegan cheese board I got double cream garlic and herb Tree Line aged artist art artisanal some mature cheddar slices and then I have one more vegan cheese in the fridge but I'll get it in a sec I always start out by laying out my cheeses vegan cheese is suspicious like I don't know if this vegan cheese is even going to be good but hopefully you know my dairy-free friends will be open-minded yeah like that smells [ __ ] weird but whatever that smells so good okay I think people are gonna like that one this is the garlic and herb one it like literally smells incredible I think this one's gonna be a hit I'm not getting my germs in it I swear I think having cheese slices on there can be kind of nice because it just makes life easier do you know what I mean and then I do have one more type of vegan cheese it's only expired by like a week so I think it's fine it's not real cheese so I feel like it doesn't expire anyway if somebody at my barbecue gets food poisoning this is not a barbecue I'm not doing a barbecue if somebody at my pool party does get food poisoning it will be my fault but at the same time that's the risk you take when you decide to be my friend time to add the fun stuff okay for some reason like this cheese board is already not looking that good and I think it's because all the cheese is like vegan and that's just like never good every time I make a cheese board everybody always asks me for honey because it apparently like really enhances the flavor added some honey added some Jam now let's add the crackers so oh wait I also have almonds oh my [ __ ] God these are truffle almonds and they smell so good oh my God they smell so good okay anyway now let's start adding crackers so I got I have some of these I feel like these are these are really good we'll add a little bit of those uh I also got this this is the cheap way to make a cheese board you just buy assorted entertainment crackers I kind of just wing it when it comes to like placement of things like I'm not I'm not thinking too deeply about it if I'm being honest I used to overcrowd my cheese boards but I've learned not to do that anymore because it just makes it a mess you also want to angle your crackers so that they don't fall off the board I make that mistake frequently I'm gonna add a few breadsticks now I'm gonna add some blackberries things what else did I have honestly I'm kind of happy with this like it's not the most elaborate cheese board but like this is perfect for a vegan cheese board it looks cute I mean it's not like the most extravagant but it's definitely cute and it's straight to the point now for the real fun let's really go crazy we're gonna go in with this one first cheese I have is always a big hit this is the garlic and herb garlic and fine herb bar so I'm gonna plop that right there it's kind of kind of did just rub my finger on it to fix it again I hope that nobody is coming to my barbecue why do I keep calling it a barbecue it's not a barbecue I hope that nobody that's coming to my pool party will watch this video and see I mean I wash my hands before this but that only goes so far like I don't think people want my finger smushing down their cheese but they don't have a choice this is some Irish cheddar this is a Brie I think I'm gonna cut this Brie because it's like in a block and I don't like that oh see that's better I'm gonna cut it in half and do one half here one half here I also got a orange Cheddar good good start Good Start okay got our honey now we add or Jam okay now we're gonna add these [ __ ] truffle almonds because people are gonna flip out over these they're so they smell dude they do make your breath smell a little bit rank though so that's why I'm not eating one right now because I'm like I don't want people to get here and be like Oh Emma smells stinky okay time to add the crackers I'm just gonna go random with it as we know these are Rosemary raisin pecan crackers I'm not a huge fan of crackers like this but they look really pretty that's that's enough for me like that sold me they look gorgeous I mean they probably taste good too they're just not my cup of tea and now let's add some blackberries randomly now here's the thing that I wanted to add that I thought would be kind of Genius so check this out my idea was to take dates we I'm scared what if somebody comes and they're allergic to peanut butter I was gonna fill a peanut butter or a date with peanut butter I feel like peanut allergies are really common so I don't want to risk that I'm trying to think what else I could add oh breadsticks for sure God this is [ __ ] classy as hell I feel really satisfied with this wow look at that cheese boards are oh my God my hair looks so bad did my hair really look this bad this whole time and you guys didn't tell me don't unsubscribe because my hair looks bad please next we're not done we're far from done we're making a little veggie platter I feel like this might be too small we're gonna use a plate I am going to be making a veggie platter it's very simple carrots you know what I might do take the hummus right and put this in the center don't forget to mix your hummus okay at the beginning of the week I actually pre-cut some bell pepper for myself and then I didn't eat all of it so we'll use that now why not right take advantage of it fresh it smells fresh I think it's fine but I'm also I'm also kind of worried last but not least my personal favorite little mini cucumbers and no this knife is not dirty it's just rusty I don't know what's worse actually I'm cutting it this way then this way then this way then this way okay veggie platter is done looks gorgeous has some spicy hummus in the center a little bit a little tiny bit of paprika a little tiny bit of olive oil okay veggie tray is done moving on moving on keep on moving keep on I'm gonna do a little fruit situation still hiding my head make sure to wash your fruit everybody I don't do it for myself but I do wash my fruit for my guests this is the point when I start to get excited it's like I've been cooking well I didn't really cook anything so I guess I haven't been cooking like I've been prepping all morning and now it's like an hour until people start showing up I've been grinding my ass off and now it's like okay what are people gonna think the goal is you want people to walk in and be like Emma you've outdone yourself except insert your name God this is [ __ ] taking forever I'm gonna add some raspberries adding some blueberries done that's [ __ ] gorgeous you've only had a little piece of mint I would put mint on top when it comes to like chips like I don't really I tend to just leave them in the bag and that's because people like to know what kind of chip that they're eating but I might with tortilla chips because you know this is like a whole ordeal here so maybe we'll put some tortilla chips in here okay but now I'm faced with a moral dilemma do I do the Scoops or do I do the hint of lime personally I like the hint of lime better but I also know that hint of lime chips are not for everybody so I'm going to not be selfish and I'm going to put the Scoops in it this is making me feel like I should have gotten guacamole and now I'm [ __ ] mad so as you can see I have more of the adult snacks here we have the charcuterie boards the veggie fruit platter more fruit and then we have the chocolate right and then over here we have more of the playful chip area these are my actual personal favorite these are so good and they don't hurt my stomach IBS Queen I think my spread's complete like I'm done I put out everything I'm gonna make a montage of it oh I forgot about something hold on check it out some drinks for outside I'm Gonna Fill both of these honestly I'm not like people could just go into my fridge and get drinks but look how [ __ ] cute these are like I just can't help myself I did it I'm ready it's done it's done my job is done you saw everything we did everything here's my little outfit this is exciting now I wait for everybody to show up hopefully this goes well I always get scared that nobody's gonna come like I'm like God I put so much work into that like nobody comes home to be pissed wish me luck I hope people show up and I hope that all my work does not go to waste and that people get to enjoy the foods that I've created and well I didn't really create them I literally just took things out of their packaging and arranged it but regardless I hope people enjoy it and I hope that you guys got a little bit inspired maybe to host a little something something I wish you guys could come to my pool party like I would that would be incredible I wish you watching this were here right now to experience and critique my work but you know what you're still here you you were here in my heart I love you all thank you guys for watching here's your forehead kiss I'm going to enjoy my pool party I really encourage you to throw

-emma chamberlain",2021-07-04T18:51:06Z,325687,8054297,8411,hi okay so it's night time which is weird i don't think i've ever started a video at night i'm exhausted you could probably tell it's like 9 30 i'm about to go to bed i can't tell if it's embarrassing or impressive for the last like three hours i've been watching all of these videos about why waking up at 5 a.m every morning is like the best thing you can do for yourself i actually took notes the benefits of waking up at 5am number one waking up early can help people who struggle with anxiety depression mood problems etc i struggle with anxiety and depression so i will try anything number two waking up early can prevent nightmares which i do occasionally have nightmares three waking up early can help establish a better sleeping pattern number four waking up early helps develop your personal discipline number six if that's the number we're on i forgot waking up early can make you more inspired and more productive and also a lot of rich people wake up early like oprah and stuff there just seems to be so many benefits to waking up at five in the morning i think the main benefit for me will be that i'm gonna have this moment of calm before the day starts and something about that excites me this is my first day of trying it i wanna try it tomorrow i don't think it's gonna be too hard for me because i already wake up relatively early i set my alarms check this out so we're doing it i want to do this because i feel like i've been on this kind of path where i'm not path i've been trying to figure out better habits that i can implement into my life that are like small habits that will make my life better because i think that they make more of a difference than you think i'm going into bed sweet dreams why am i doing this why why would i do this i want to go back to bed i can't give up hello i want to go back to bed okay it's probably unhealthy up close my phone is my head i'm already [ __ ] up so i'm going to make a coffee oh my god it's hard to get out of bed my eyeballs are so poppy okay what's up little [ __ ] okay it's getting easier now i feel like i'm up that is pretty i can't lie i'm up i made cold brew last night that's exciting oh the seat is wet from condensation yes i am wearing my cheetah snuggie it makes me feel safe okay that makes the lighting better had to put a flashlight on my face because it's that dark out so far i mean getting up this morning hurt pretty bad but i think the reason for that is is that i went to bed a little bit earlier than normal i went to bed at 9 30 and i normally go to bed at like 10 10 30 11 9 30 is pretty early for me my anxiety was terrible last night that hasn't happened to me in a while but i think that's what happens when you try to go to bed with too much pent-up energy is that your brain just starts getting anxious so i didn't fall asleep probably until like 11 30 because my brain just could not shut off so waking up this morning was a little bit harder than i expected but we're here the feeling that i'm getting from the world around me right now very much reminds me of when you have to wake up really early with your family to go to the airport if you guys are going on like a family trip like that's kind of the vibe i'm getting right now the problem is i don't really know what to do i was thinking that i could try to go to the gym right now because they're open but first i'm just going to sit and enjoy the ambiance and then i'll go to the gym i think i'm gonna journal for five to ten minutes just about like i don't know maybe talk about some things i'm grateful for some things i'm looking forward to goals i don't know just the good stuff i'm definitely still tired i mean definitely still tired i'm gonna push through because something's gonna click in my brain at some point but right now i feel a little bit like a zombie still um i'm going to the gym right now i'm like not looking forward to it at all because it's so early but at the same time i want to try out this early morning lifestyle see if it makes me feel more productive yes everybody yes early risers you guys are my people now i thought that on the way to the gym i tell you a quick story so yesterday i was cutting up some broccoli for the week because i've been trying to like cut up all my fruits and vegetables in the beginning of the week because then it just makes it easy that is what some people call adulting so i'm cutting up broccoli and i noticed that some pieces looked a little bit moldy like they had some like brown dirt stuff all over them that looked like mold because it was kind of like lumpy and so i was like okay ew like that's gross i'm gonna cut those pieces off and as i'm like cutting out the broccoli i'm like damn there's a lot of pieces with this like weird moldy [ __ ] on it but i was also kind of confused because it'd be like one little piece would be super moldy and then the piece of broccoli directly next to it would have no mold on it and i'm like this is weird because normally mold kind of like spreads so i was like what's going on here so finally after like throwing away half of my broccoli because it all was moldy i decided to look up really close at the mold because i was like maybe this is just leftover dirt i look up close at the broccoli at the little lumps of moldy dirt or whatever the [ __ ] it was it wasn't mold and it wasn't dirt it was little tiny bugs that were dead like hundreds of them and they their little legs sticking out it's safe to say i'm never eating a vegetable again like i'm somebody i genuinely enjoy as a vegetarian i've learned to love vegetables but i'm actually never eating a [ __ ] vegetable again or fruit for that matter i don't ever want to eat anything that came from the ground again telling that story just now and and like really reliving that experience just woke me the [ __ ] up like i feel awake now i feel like my biggest struggle in the morning is how genuinely like weirdly cold and like achy i feel like i always feel really cold and achy when i wake up really early like i remember when um i was in school and i'd have to wake up at like 6 30 or whatever i was always like freezing cold in the morning and it took me so long to get warm so that was always my struggle and i'm struggling with that right now when i was watching a bunch of videos about the benefits of waking up early almost every person that talked about it was very adamant about discussing the importance of a solid morning routine like you can't just wake up at 5am and lay in bed and go on instagram for an extra three hours like that completely defeats the purpose it's like if you wake up early you got to use that time wisely exercise make coffee journal it's 6 30 right now which is not that early but it's still pretty [ __ ] early there's no parking at the gym if this is not a spot i'm gonna [ __ ] flip out oh no it is watch the gym be like more crowded than usual i'm gonna be so pissed okay i'm not gonna lie i don't want to go in i don't am i stalling right now yes i am stalling i also in my defense i have to finish my celsius energy drink ah this is tough this is tough but i can do it you know what i was realizing earlier this is the last thing i'm gonna say and then i'm going into the gym because i need to stop [ __ ] stalling today i was writing some things that i was manifesting in my journal what's the definition of manifesting for those of you who don't know let's find out manifesting is making something happen making it real wishing for it so that it comes true okay that's basically what it is so shut up shut up it's too early sorry siri i don't know what that was that was weird anyway but it's good to write down some manifestations in your journal some things that you want to happen to you etc etc but today was writing down like things that i was manifesting and i was like i have control over all of these things like if i want these things to happen i can choose that for example i wrote down and i was manifesting that i start waking up earlier in the morning and then i realized i was like emma i you can just do that okay i am really stalling i'm going to go into the gym [Music] i'm done i have a really hard time drinking water i don't know what my problem is but i know i need to drink it right now do not look at my airpod i didn't film in there because shocker it was more busy than it is when i normally go i normally go at 10 a.m it was more busy now than usual so now it's like almost 8 i don't know what to do i'm gonna try a new coffee place because why not i have nothing better to do so here's the thing about trying new things if you're a busy person whether that's with school or work or whatever it may be if you're even kind of a busy person the thought of trying new things is exhausting because you're like i already have enough [ __ ] to do just to make ends meet i find that i feel like that all the time i think that this is where waking up early comes in it's 8 a.m which is normally when i wake up and i've already done all of my like things that i need to get done in the day that to make me happy i've already done those things by 8 a.m so now let's say someone asked me to lunch at noon normally i'd be like no i'm at the gym i can't no i'm working i can't no i'm cleaning my house i can't but now all of my knee stuff is done by 8 am so if somebody asked me for to lunch now i'd be like absolutely i already did all of my activities for me now i can hang out with you anyway i'm going to a coffee shop that looks kind of reminds me of france oh are you going to take my [ __ ] parking spot no you're not oh love okay so i'm gonna go into this coffee shop we'll see if it's good or not i don't know got my nails done yesterday kind of classy but a little bit funky anyway let's go into the coffee shop that was exciting to try a new place i really want to start trying new places more often because i feel like i don't i also tend to make coffee at home a lot so i don't really go out as much anymore but it's kind of fun although there was a spider massive like a fatty spider like this [ __ ] was like at my table and i like i looked down at my leg and it was like an inch away from my leg and i was like i don't know how long i can sit out here and then i moved tables which made me a little bit less frightened but then i started to feel like there were spiders crawling all over me apparently i'm having a bug problem like there was [ __ ] bugs all over my broccoli now there's bugs while i'm trying to drink my morning coffee like what the [ __ ] going on i'm trying to think there's any errands i could run because i think that right now is a great time to run errands i just don't have any errands to run right now i actually could run to trader joe's trader joe's sells this specific seasoning that i'm obsessed with putting on my eggs and i don't know how much i have left and i don't think i have a lot left and they only sell it at trader joe's but i always avoid going to trader joe's because it's always so busy but it's eight in the morning 8 30 in the morning which means it's probably not gonna be very busy which means this is a good time to go to trader joe's so i guess i'll go to trader joe's i haven't been to trader joe's actually in so long i mean it's been like three weeks but still like i haven't been in so long like maybe they have some fun new snacks too so i'll go to trader joe's that will be my errand of the morning and then i'll go home and get some work done and be a productive young woman i do weirdly feel motivated to like get some work done you know like i feel motivated to go through my [ __ ] emails i'm up so i'm up so early i might as well be oprah you know what i'm saying or elon musk who else wakes up at 5 am is it elon musk i don't know whatever but like i might as well be one of them at this point with how badly i want to read my [ __ ] emails oh i can't wait to go through my emails i also have gas [Music] um we have good news and bad news good news trader joe's is vacant there was no line there was infinite levels of parking it was amazing bad news is that trader joe's discontinued the seasoning that i literally came here for vegan chickenless seasoning salt it's gone i think it's gone so i'm ordering some on amazon they do have it on amazon brb literally ordering six of them is that too much i'm ordering six of them like that's not a waste of time or money in my opinion that is exactly what i deserve it only tastes good on eggs though weirdly like it doesn't taste good on anything else i've tried to put it on other things it's not as good but like it is so good on eggs so let's do a trader joe's haul anyway because whatever first thing i got was this dark chocolate coffee buzz bar oh look how cute smells [ __ ] amazing that is [ __ ] good that's a 10 out of 10. the other [ __ ] i got was so [ __ ] boring cucumbers because i forgot to buy them the last time i was at the grocery store frozen raspberries because i like them in smoothies everyday seasoning because i use this a lot as well and then i also got this mushroom and company multi-purpose umami seasoning blend so that's all i got from trader joe's because they didn't have my vegan chickenless seasoning salt i feel [ __ ] freaked out and upset right now i mean i did just order six on amazon i'm honestly considering ordering more i'm not gonna [ __ ] on trader joe's because i do love them and i do love what they do i love everything that they do i'm just a little bit pissed right now all before 9 a.m i got pissed off at trader joe's and then forgave trader joe's waking up at 5 am is crazy actually it is 9 am now so i can't really say that but it's time to go home and be productive now i feel good sorry i can't sing i farted i'm done i showered i took a body shower i moisturized my whole body i'm enjoying nature i have my coffee from earlier that i didn't finish i'm going to do some work now and be productive i did not wake up at this hour for nothing i never work outside like i always work inside so this is new i feel like i've lived three days in one i'm about to make breakfast and i'm like i feel like i've been awake for three days already i'm about to put eggs in the toaster oven so i don't think you guys realize how much i love this spicy hummus let me just prove to you how much i like the spicy hummus i have four more spicy hummuses on deck in my refrigerator at all times i eat it with everything i don't think i eat one meal without it like i put it on everything here's the seasoning that i was talking about earlier i love you so much i'm the only one that eats it so i can do stuff like that i feel like i'm ready to get out of the house i would eat this like this if it wasn't socially unacceptable i mean i guess you could i love hummus so much i want to get out of the house and do something i'm feeling inspired i thought i'd take a little minute before i figure out what i'm going to do with the rest of my day to thank the sponsor of today's video seat geek thank you seatgeek

for about an hour i was gonna like try to get out of the house i thought i was feeling inspired and then i was like oh but i just want to lay in bed for a little bit so i've been laying in bed watching videos about fashion not necessarily super productive i'm feeling a little bit tired like i could take a nap but i'm not allowing myself to take a nap today because i'm trying to adjust my sleep schedule so that waking up at 5am becomes natural for me we'll see if that ever happens it is 2 00 p.m i think i should share my new shoes with you they're like a mixture of a platform doc martin and a birkenstock this is my summer shoe officially i have been in bed for a few hours i know that if i start like reading a book or something i will take a nap so i'm getting out of the house i think i'm gonna get a coffee to start and then just kind of like see where you know the day takes me you know what i used to do when i lived in um when i lived at home in northern california is i would drive around and just look and if i'd see a coffee shop that i was interested in i would just stop and go in maybe i'll just do that right now hey [ __ ] it i have the time i woke up at 5am and got everything done i'm i got the rest of the day for me baby and nobody wants to hang out with me so [Applause] i also didn't ask if anybody wanted to hang out oh my god i'm so guilty of that i literally am such a [ __ ] i will be like nobody wants to hang out with me i'm like did i ask anybody if they wanted to hang out did i put any effort in no i feel like i've seen a coffee shop over here that looked cute that i haven't tried so let's see if that's real or if that's my imagination i need coffee right now like i mean i only had one coffee i did also have an energy drink oh we ate three coffees we only live once and guess what i woke up at 5 am so i can do whatever i want see this might be actually bad i'm about to put on lip plumping lip balm i'm feeling spontaneous right now i also don't know why this is in my car when it got here why it's here but my lips are about to look super juicy so should i go get a tattoo right now i'm driving past a tattoo shop i'm like no nope don't do that no okay crossing my fingers for a coffee shop okay there's literally one right there and it's closed like what the [ __ ] if only there was a chamberlain coffee coffee shop in los angeles then i would no longer be struggling that's not a teaser i don't have any plans of doing that right now but i would love to so don't think i'm like trying to hint at something okay i kind of want to give up oh wait no oh my god i'm right near a coffee shop right now that i've driven past two or three times that just opened oh wait but i think it might be a bar i think it might be a bar slash coffee shop which is honestly kind of lit whoa but also maybe not because like i don't know how that works like i don't like are they gonna let me in if there's an age limit well there's not gonna be an age limit at 2 pm oh my god it's not open guys i swear to god i'm being tested right now i just got an idea okay i'll see you when i get there i'm gonna drive to another city i'm in one city in l.a i'm gonna drive to another one and i'll see you when i get there i i cuz they have so many good coffee shops it's like 25 minutes away but it's so worth it i'll see you when i get there i did just listen to cold play for the past 20 minutes the entire way here i feel like i could burst out crying and screaming right now but we're [Music] i here finished my coffee and i came into the bathroom to go pee and there's literally a disco light in the bathroom so you know what that means dance party [Music] i'm just walking around hanging out all the cars driving past me are looking at me talking to my phone i'm just going for a walk we'll see if anything peaks my interest regardless it's a nice warm day so i'm just enjoying the warmth and walking how is how am i still living in in the same day i feel like i have lived 10 days in one i got home a few hours ago i got in pjs i laid in bed i'm gonna cook i am exhausted i feel like i'm gonna go to bed at 8 00 pm tonight so what's my review on waking up at 5 am i'm going to rate it out of 10. 10 being this is the best thing ever a one being this is the worst thing ever i'm gonna give it a seven because i really liked it and i really feel like i benefited from it like i don't think it was pointless like i think that you know it made me feel good i felt proud of myself all day because i stayed up you know i mean because i got up okay i so i'm actually gonna take it down to a six out of ten because i'm so tired right now that i can't get out a sentence i think it was good because i i can't see how it would help boost your self-esteem i also felt like inspired to try new things the only problem is that it's you know 6 p.m and i am exhausted do you know what i think i'm going to do i don't think i'm going to do this every day but i think i'm gonna do this as often as i can what was i talking about like i don't even know what i'm talking about right now knowing me right now like i might burn my food because i'm probably gonna fall asleep while it's cooking i'm proud of myself that i'm even cooking right now for starters this is gorgeous anyway oh my gosh the sauce is so [ __ ] good i wrote a pros and cons list of waking up at 5am we'll start with the pros number one you get everything done really early which relieves stress so that's good the second pro is that you feel like you have all this free time which inspires you to try new things and do fun things the third pro is that i felt badass all day i felt almost better than everybody else and that that actually might be a con fourth pro and final pro is that when you run errands it's less complicated because there's nobody awake yet so nothing is busy now let's go to the cons number one i'm extremely tired and grumpy and it's 6 p.m second con is that it's unsustainable for somebody my age because sometimes i want to party late at night until 5 a.m that really doesn't ever happen but sometimes overall though i had a good day i think that's all i got for today i'm going to lay in bed i'm gonna read my book i'm gonna watch some youtube and i'm gonna [ __ ] go to bed at 8 pm tonight in vlogs moving forward you guys will be able to see whether or not i decide to make this part of my routine in daily life why do i keep taking bites and then trying to talk okay guys thank you for hanging out with me do i broccoli oh god thank you guys for hanging out with me today i hope that you had fun i appreciate you hanging out with me every week and i can't wait to see you next week and here's your forehead kiss one more one more this is how i'm gonna end the video drum check [Music] love you

-emma chamberlain",2021-06-27T18:01:25Z,244664,5329065,5969,good morning [Music] it is 8 30 in the morning i am sitting outside of a coffee shop i am going to pick up my coffee in approximately 10 minutes once it's done because i ordered it on my phone and it says that it won't be ready until 8 40 and it's 8 30 now which is honestly [ __ ] annoying like how long does it take to make an iced almond milk macadamia nut milk latte seriously anyway i had a burning urge to spend the day out of the house today i woke up this morning and i was like i don't want to be home maybe subconsciously my brain was like you need to spend the day outdoors we're having a grand day out while i wait for my coffee apparently there was a louis vuitton fashion show this morning at five in the morning i missed it i did not wake up on time because just wasn't happening um but while i wait for my coffee i'm going to watch the show wow oh i like that one i really like that one look at that also wherever the [ __ ] this fashion show was i want to have my wedding there oh that that's gorgeous okay that was fun um started my morning with a little a little runway fashion to inspire me to get me revved up for the day i don't think my coffee is ready yet but i feel like i should just go out there and ask i'm back i'm not really fully woken up yet because it's like 8 30 i mean like i i'm awake i am awake i am ready for the day but i still feel a little bit you know cheers okay my coffee machine broke probably three weeks ago i ordered a new one and it still has not come which sucks but it's also a fun excuse to like go out and get coffee every morning which honestly i do enjoy i do like the experience of going to a cafe and you know you know enjoying it and all that anyway i think that for our first stop of the day we are gonna go to the gym you might be thinking emma why what has come over you why are you going to the gym who are you we don't recognize you we're scared we're frightened i'm not gonna lie i'm kind of really into going to the gym and i kind of been falling in love with it and i'm kind of on the brink of becoming a fitness influencer like i'm really this close i know i talk about this too often like while i'm driving to the gym i'm like ugh but i know how good i'm gonna feel once i get started it's interesting i've always been somebody who has been better at challenging myself physically than mentally for example i'd rather force myself to run a mile in like six and a half minutes than force myself to learn how to play a song on the guitar i would rather ride a bike for 20 miles than spend 20 hours on a painting i've just always preferred physical hobbies maybe i should run a marathon i feel like i need a goal like that you know although i don't think i like running enough to do a marathon so i'm gonna have to kind of think about some sort of uh goal maybe i should do well you know what's trendy in the youtube space right now is wrestling matches okay if i had to wrestle a youtuber why do i feel like i'm gonna get in trouble if i literally mention any youtuber's name you know what i i'm gonna stay out of it i'm not gonna wrestle anybody i don't i hate it the way that the youtube community works is you say like i wanna wrestle blank and the next thing you know like you have to start training i am drinking double energy drinks right now celsius and a coffee that's so bad for you don't do that comment down below if you want to see me box another youtuber and tell me who you think i should box i'm kidding because i would never [ __ ] do that i really don't think i could punch somebody i think i would just let them beat me up there's no way that this is good for you i don't know why i got a coffee if i was just gonna come to the gym and drink this i'm gonna be anxious as [ __ ] oh god this is a lot of caffeine in it wait how much are you supposed to have in a day 400 milligrams of caffeine is healthy for an adult this has already 200 let's see how much is in my coffee okay this has approximately almost 200 as well because i got four shots of espresso in it so basically i've already maxed out on my caffeine for the day i'm not i'll save this for after my workout but like why do i do this i also am kind of dreading going into the gym right now at this hour i'm like not fully awake yet so i'm wondering how this is gonna go i feel like i need this to like i need to finish this yes [Music] i i'm tired i did a little running i did a little walking i did a little bit of stretching the thing that i love about la is that let's say you work out in the morning and then you want to like go run errands afterwards that is absolutely acceptable here in los angeles because people just wear active wear all day every day anyway so i can walk around sweaty in my workout outfit all day if i want brace yourselves i've made the spontaneous and random decision to drive to the beach i live in california i live by the beach it's summer it's hot out it's already 75 degrees it's gonna be like 80 degrees i need to use california for what it has to offer and one of my favorite things it has to offer is the beach i am gonna go on a really really nice really relaxing stroll then i'm going to go and get some food it's going to be a whole thing the beach is only 30 minutes away from me if i don't take advantage of it this summer i've failed for the first few months i like don't take advantage of the fact that it's summer and then for the last month and a half i like really go hard i've made the decision i'm like i'm gonna go hard all summer beach every day [ __ ] it why not maybe not every day but like a lot of a lot of days you know what's crazy i was in the gym today and i swear to god i see the same people in the gym every day and what's crazy about it is is that i go to the gym at like very different times every day like sometimes i'll go at nine in the morning sometimes i'll go at noon sometimes i'll go at 3 p.m and i still see the same people every time which makes me think that people just hang out there all day maybe that's an la thing like i'm kind of dumbfounded what like what are these people how do these people have enough time to be at the gym for like eight hours a day but honestly like mad respect like i good for them but like what are they doing one more thing about the gym showering up the gym when i used to go to the gym in high school i would always shower at the gym and it like didn't bother me but like i have a raging phobia of showering at the gym and of somebody filming me naked i was thinking about it and i was like okay worst case scenario somebody filmed me naked and posted it to the internet would i really care not really i would hope that they got a good angle at least bare minimum i was thinking about it and i was like i wouldn't really care if there was a video of me showering at the gym on the internet like it would it wouldn't be my favorite like it definitely would not be my favorite thing but i think i'd get over it we all have boobs in the cooter yet i still am like scared nobody can drive nobody can drive here i'm still frightened of showering at the gym despite the fact that like i don't think i would really care that much i feel like sometimes i fear things even though like they wouldn't be that bad if they happened like this is a great example like i have this weird irrational fear that somebody's gonna film me but not only is that not gonna happen because it's extremely illegal and also just people don't do that but also even if it did happen i wouldn't real it would be fine that's i guess what anxiety is so maybe i'm just describing anxiety okay great good talk so i made it to the beach which is amazing but i also ran out of gas so i'm going to make the risky decision of going to the beach and then hopefully i have enough gas after i'm done at the beach to go get more gas i love a little bit of spontaneity in my day you know but sometimes i'm a little bit too spontaneous and i neglect to do the minimum preparation like i i fail to even check oh do i have enough gas to go all the way to the beach well so that's where i'm at i think i have i mean i think i have enough gas to make it to the beach and then make it to a gas station after the beach i think i do it will be a fun adventure um i'm trying to look at this in a positive there's a [ __ ] gas station oh the universe got me i feel so [ __ ] lucky look right as i was talking about it too i swear to god the universe really got me sometimes wait this is actually cute shout out to the universe that was really sweet of them [Music] that was nice i sat on the beach soaked up a little bit of sun but now i'm [ __ ] starving i am excited to announce that i'm going to go to drumroll please air one shocker so excited to announce that they have one very close to the beach that i'm at and i'm excited to announce that i will be attending air one right now i'm actually on the way i decided i'm also going to put a bathing suit in my car and a towel in my car and i'm going to keep it there at all times so that if i ever make a spontaneous uh decision to go to the beach i have the proper equipment because i was a little bit bummed out that i couldn't swim in the ocean because it just looked so delectable and i saw all these kids swimming in there and i was like [ __ ] you guys like like i was literally jealous of the 12 year olds that were in the ocean and that's not necessarily the best feeling i learned a lesson now i'm just going to keep a bathing suit in a towel in my car at all times [Music] i am such a creature of habit i get obsessed with like one thing and then i just wear it out like right now it's this stupid salad from erwan it's just a matter of time before i'm sick of it and then god knows what's next but i just like i get obsessed with things and i get into a routine and then it evolves and like you know who knows what comes next but right now it's this [ __ ] it's air one [Music] it's [ __ ] hot in here i just got out of the shower i feel absolutely incredible my earring just fell out i feel so tired because i did so much in the beginning of the day like i already went to like it's only like 2 p.m right now it's bedtime for like a little bit like just a little afternoon nap putting in my hair products i just put in a detangler and a hair oil i'm gonna brush through that i didn't wash my face in the shower because i decided that i would do my whole skincare for you in honor of the sponsor of today's video bad habit skincare thank you to bad habit for sponsoring this video let me show you my double cleansing routine i like to double cleanse when i've been wearing a lot of makeup or when i sweat a lot when it's really hot out because double cleansing really ensures that your face is as clean as it can possibly be first i'm going to use the bad habit um's acai nightly cleansing balm this works really well for taking off your makeup at night but i use it more than just that then this says grapeseed oil vitamin e and shea butter in it which all moisturizes and softens this is just going to help me get off all that i sweat a lot in the first half of today and i feel like i just need to really get in there this is really soothing and really melted away excess makeup sweat the whole nine yards okay so once i'm done with that dry my face off and then go in with round two wake things up matcha and mint daily cleanser one of my favorite ingredients in this is aloe vera which keeps things calm and smooth and this is the second step of my double cleanse so that i can really just make sure all of the [ __ ] is off my face okay it's very refreshing and cooling now that my face is double cleansed i'm going to take a mask this is the bad habit face mask trio there's three masks one that's for exfoliating total reboot one that's for hydrating the silent mode hydrating hyaluronic mask and then one for a detoxifying effect which is the 10 minute rehab green juice charcoal detox mask i am going to do the hydrating mask today oh wait i don't know why i'm opening this one i already have one that's open this silent mode hydrating mask has hyaluronic acid in it to give you that moisture and i feel like during the summer i get kind of dry but this is also one of my favorite masks of all time although i do love to use this total reboot aha bha enzyme peel once a week so we're gonna leave this mask on for about 10 minutes thank you again a bad habit for sponsoring this video go check out the new mini mask trio there's kind of a mask for everything in here i'm obsessed with this thank you to bad habit for sponsoring this video links to everything will be in the description bad habit is available at morphe.com badhabitbeauty.com and ulta select ulta stores gonna put on some lip mask i washed off my face mask and moisturized i feel amazing i feel clean i feel so much better i kind of felt like [ __ ] i think cuz i was so sweaty i just like felt gross and then i showered now i feel amazing but it's 90 degrees outside which is a little bit much for me so i think i'm going to do something really crazy and really unexpected right now and i'm going to read get this i'm going to read in journal are we surprised we're not we're not surprised like we're just not i also have a coffee did i zoom in like this to block out the fact that i had another coffee on my nightstand yes because we all know that i'm already at a dangerous caffeine level right now this one might just push me over the edge but in my defense i don't have a defense like i don't time for some self-care okay did i take a nap yes it's now like 5 p.m see this is the thing it's like if you're productive in the morning you end up having to take a nap and then the second half of your day is [ __ ] whereas if you sleep in the first half of your day is [ __ ] but then the second half of the day you have a chance to catch up so i guess you know you win either way i have a lot of packages that i need to open so i'm going to open a bunch of these off camera because that shit's going to be boring and then i'm going to do a haul of some of the stuff that i either got sent to me in pr or i bought in approximately 30 minutes i'll be doing a haul it will be approximately one second for you in youtube time so okay i unboxed most of it and i'm gonna show you some of the highlights the first thing i got is this vital proteins collagen peptides which is good for your skin hair nails and joint support my mom told me that this is good for me next i got a new milk frother this one looks like it's made out of wood which i thought was really nice my other milk frother is kind of dying so i got another one and this one has cute looks like it's made of wood much cuter than my other ones does it come with a battery no that's should be illegal moving on i got some biker shorts here are some brown ones some red ones some black ones this is the brand they make my favorite biker shorts ever for some reason then i ordered this bathing suit i mean nothing crazy then i ordered two sweat sets because i'm just like i've just been like wearing sweatpants so much that i was like you know what i'm gonna get more so i ordered a little oatmeal pair of sweatpants in the matching little cropped zipper thing i just know i'm gonna wear these all the time this is from los angeles apparel i also ordered the same one in gray and then the last interesting thing i got in the mail was a package from my girl kim skins i got a little black tank a little brown top this is really cute another black tank but this one's longer a little pair of black biker shorts these are so soft i literally can't wait to wear these a little simple black bralette a sheer creamy colored dress i also got this little tan tank last but not least i got these little underwear shorts those will come in handy and that's pretty much all the interesting stuff i got the other stuff i got was like hangers for my closet cat food cat litter nothing interesting i kind of want to try on these sweatpants i'm gonna put them on and give you a sweatpant review because to be honest i am so picky about my sweatpants and i will be the first person to tell you that these sweatpants suck los angeles apparel i'm about to put your sweatpants to the test oh my god um these are actually amazing these are actually amazing don't look at the back of my head let's see how it looks with the matching top let's see if it's like a full fit moment i mean it does the job i'm sold i will definitely be wearing this quite frequently probably more than i should okay well that was exciting um i really want to drink another coffee but it's like 5 30 now so that's not good i'd make a decaf coffee but i don't have a coffee machine right now it's broken so this might have to be my favorite time of day sorry i need to pop my ears this might be my favorite time of day in los angeles the day was really hot like it was really hot out today but now it's not really hot anymore it's just like comfy i'm gonna have myself a pink lemonade my favorite part of summer is exactly what i'm experiencing right now when it's warm at night and bright and the weather is just so warm and comfy but not too warm i love this [ __ ] cheers i brought my book out i brought my phone out recently i've been randomly like i never have listened to ted talks but recently i've been listening to ted talks if you don't know what ted talks are they're like motivational speeches and i've been enjoying listening to them so i might listen to a ted talk they literally have ted talks about everything like this one is called the art of being yourself this next one's called mindset is everything another one is called food is medicine the next one's called overcoming rejection like all these things are very interesting and useful i might even listen to music out here like the opportunities are endless i don't know what do i do should i read if i read then i can't look at the view nobody's talking about that when you read it's great but you can't look around you that's controversial that's actually controversial maybe reading is a scam get out it's okay i'm gonna read anyway [Music] um it is bedtime it's like not even late but i'm just ready for bed hi i just wanted to thank you for hanging out with me today i had a really good day here's your forehead kiss one more for good measure and one more just in case the last two weren't enough i love you i appreciate you i enjoy hanging out with you every week and i'm excited to see you next week but until then i'm going to eat and go to bed i'll see ya love you [Music] you

-emma chamberlain",2021-06-20T17:00:23Z,275631,4999411,6411,good morning beautiful i'm making a matcha right now because my coffee machine broke i ordered a new one but apparently it's taking a long time to come so i've been making matcha every day instead probably good for me to be honest have a little coffee break i don't really know if i make matcha correctly i woke up this morning with a terrible taste in my mouth not like metaphorically like actually a bad taste in my mouth last night i made myself a stir fry for dinner and i was putting garlic powder in it because i wasn't going to see anybody for the rest of the evening so i could use garlic powder and i spilled way too much so i brushed my teeth really hard last night and then i wake up this morning and my mouth still tastes like garlic and i'm not gonna lie to you i'm not thrilled about it don't look at my hair i add some ice cubes and my matcha's complete shall we sit outside for a second and see how the weather is oh my god all the plants in my backyard fell over how did this happen oh my god it's such a nice day out okay but look i do not understand how they fell over i'm gonna try to lift them back up myself but we'll see if i get injured in the process okay that wasn't too bad it was upsetting but um i'm going to sit outside this morning because it is such a beautiful morning out i feel like finally the gloomy days in california are coming to an end this is how summer in california works it's like in may you'll get a little bit of hot weather and you start to get comfortable you're like oh my god summer's here it's hot girl summer like i'm gonna shake some ass i'm gonna break some hearts i'm gonna make some memories like the whole thing and then at the end of may it gets cold again and you're like holy [ __ ] wait everybody stop the presses i'm not shaking ass yet i'm not breaking hearts yet everything is put on hold and then at some point in june it gets warm again and then you're like okay now i'm gonna shake some ass but it's like you kind of get a little blue bald in a sense if you don't know what blue bald means just google it because i don't want to explain it i also have a brand deal in this video and i'm trying to be respectful of the brand if you didn't know any better you'd think that i really had my life together right now it's [ __ ] loud out here every morning um before i go on my phone i tried to read or journal or do a little mixture bowl i go back and forth between having good self-control with my phone usage and not having good self-control in my phone usage if i start my day by going on my phone my days ruin so every morning i've been very much trying to journal or read or bulk how you start your day really it really makes a difference and it really sets the tone i like to write in my journal about things i'm struggling with or like things i want to say manifest like things that want to happen to me in addition i'm reading the book the razor's edge by summerset mom i had my little morning routine i drank my matcha i read my book i did my journal now it's time to be active i'm on my way to the gym i've come to terms with my new love for the gym because when i first started going to the gym again i was like this is actually embarrassing because i think there's like a stigma around going to the gym that's negative and it's always like oh the people who go to the gym take all these supplements and are so obsessed with how they look and whatever which i understand that stigma because i think that does exist for sure but i really like the gym not only helps with my mental state and keeps me happy but it also helps with my stomach problems because i have stomach problems recently what i've been doing at the gym is i go on the treadmill for about 30 minutes and then i do all the weight machines that i feel like using that day and then i go home oh no then i stretch then i go home and that's my workout routine and sometimes i'll do like some squats or some crunches or some planks at the end of my workout but recently i've just been doing the weight machines i'm genuinely embarrassed at how much i like it as [ __ ] up as this sounds i just don't feel like it matches my aesthetic it's that's a really bad way to look at life like for example a workout that would match my aesthetic more if you will maybe doing yoga i feel like that's what people would expect me to do just based on my personality but no i like the [ __ ] gym what are we gonna do what are we gonna do long story [ __ ] short we're going to the gym well you know what's funny is that when i first started going it was like kind of tough for me to like like i'd be so tired after my workout i'd be like i can't do this again for another week like i don't think i can do this again but i pushed through that and i kept going and i've been going consistently for about a month now like not only is it satisfying to feel yourself become stronger but also now like it's more fun the moral of that story is if you are getting into you know exercise and you're figuring out like what you want your exercise routine to be be patient with yourself because i think that the first week or so is pretty miserable maybe even the first month is kind of miserable but then after that like you just start to really enjoy it like you start to enjoy it so maybe fitness is my new hobby maybe i'm gonna become a fitness influencer okay is that what you guys [ __ ] want from me you don't trust me because i'm not doing anything spectacular i don't know i think it's a i'm ex like i'm weirdly into it it definitely is shocking although this isn't the first time because i had a little phase where i was obsessed with cycling classes give this video a fatty thumbs up if you guys remember my cycling class phase i was going to like soul cycle every day and it was my favorite thing ever but as long as you forget that other people are in the gym with you it's pretty great [Music] oh i don't look good okay i just finished my workout um filming in there is so terrifying like i got so nervous i also like always get really nervous when i'm on the treadmill because i feel like you know because i'm wearing headphones and sometimes i accidentally fart when i'm running and if i'm wearing headphones then i don't hear my own fart whatever you guys don't want to [ __ ] hear about my like bowel movements and stuff anymore i know that but it's just hard for me not to bring it up these are so prevalent in my life but anyway what's next for the day so number one i want to get a coffee somewhere don't know where actually i see a little coffee shop on the corner here that i've never been to so i might pop in there i want to run into sephora to get some new makeup because when i moved i decided to like clean out my makeup drawers and i need new makeup because now i'm like don't have [ __ ] i also wanted to run into lululemon to get some um more biker shorts for working out i wore biker shorts today so yeah i'm gonna do a little shopping sometimes if you put some like boundaries on yourself and you're like you know what i'm i'm only gonna save shopping or eating out at restaurants or going to the movie theater like i'm only gonna save that stuff for special occasions i find that you end up appreciating it more and that's kind of what's happening to me with shopping because i feel like i used to shop so often that i stopped appreciating it whereas now i kind of stopped shopping as much and whenever i do go shopping i appreciate it but that actually relates to our sponsor of today's video which is nate nate is an app and i think the best way to explain it would be it's a combination of a mood board mixed with online shopping mixed with after pay basically while you're online shopping you can save items that you like to boards that are in the nate app and then if you end up wanting to buy them you can and all of the things that you want to buy are all in one place or you could make lists to share with your friends i mean like the opportunities are endless so on the nate app i actually created two lists one inspired by new york and one inspired by los angeles with a bunch of pieces clothing pieces specifically that i feel like encapsulate the vibe of both cities i forgot to mention that everybody who makes a list titled emma's inspo wins a gift every single one of you make a list get a gift is that rhyme so check it out link is in my description download the nate app i'm actually a really big fan of it i think it's amazing it's super fun and there's so many different ways that you can use it nate is a great app link in description check it out thank you to nate for sponsoring this video i was gonna like drive somewhere to get coffee but there's like literally two coffee shops i don't know which one to go to there's like three of them okay we're gonna go grab a coffee i'm honestly i'm super dehydrated and i forgot to bring a water to the gym so now i'm just like dehydrated and i'm about to go get a coffee maybe i'll get a water too but like maybe not so a large iced americano with almond milk thank you okay i'm back got my coffee let's give it a try it's not my favorite but it's definitely better than i expected because when you just go to a random place like you really don't know you're getting yourself into i would definitely go to this place again i think next time i'd ask for extra ice i don't feel like there's enough ice in it but i'm also a [ __ ] and very picky so some girls staring at me i hate when people stare at me people can literally stare at me for three seconds be like and i'd be like they're staring at me they're harassing me [Music] it's haul time it's such nice weather out and they were playing john mayer on the loudspeaker at the mall and it felt pretty romantic i went to sephora lemon let's start with a little lemon i was actually so embarrassed because i'm in my workout clothes and i'm wearing a little lemon top and lululemon bottoms and then i walk into lululemon and i'm like gonna buy more stuff like i hate that they should give people a discount if they come in wearing a full fit first thing i got was a pair of biker shorts they are in navy blue i refuse to buy light colored leggings because they show sweat and then it looks like you pissed yourself anyway i also got some workout tank tops so i got this cute little blue striped one listen i don't really care about how my workout clothes look but then again it is fun to feel a little cute i also got this little light blue one i just love this shade of blue anyway now makeup from sephora i didn't get a lot because i kind of like forgot what i needed but there was a few things i knew that i needed number one was a new eyelash curler boring number two is a new mascara i decided to try out this dior show pump and volume hd oh my god wait what what is this oh my god okay so apparently you like squeeze this wait what this is like squishy and you're supposed to squeeze it when you're i don't know i don't know give every lash a volume boost squeeze the flexible tube once or twice to soften the formula oh that's actually smart next i got a lipstick this is the charlotte tilbury pillow talk matte revolution next this is a charlotte tilbury hyaluronic and happiness happy kiss color bomb honestly we could try it on now why not oh i like that what's next what's next oh this is an amazing product this is the tatcha the kisu lip mask so it's like a lip balm in this little pot and it comes with this little scooper and you scoop it out it's amazing i also got this i don't know what this bread how to pronounce this brand but it's like this facial spray i like having like a bunch of mini little facial sprays and i feel like you can just like i don't know they're just nice okay next i am on the lookout for a new um setting powder for my makeup so i found this mini charlotte tilbury air airbrush flawless finish i'll try it out i'll let you guys know how it goes and that's it that's all i got from sephora the main thing i needed was a new mascara and an eyelash curler i don't really wear like i don't really like have that many products that i wear on a daily basis so it was not difficult to restock because they were just don't use that much stuff anyway i'm hungry so we're gonna go to literally my favorite place in los angeles erwin i don't know if i need to explain this again but i'm going to anyway air one is an overpriced you know what it's not overpriced i always call it overpriced but erwin is not overpriced they have such fresh food that i cannot even call it overpriced because the quality of their food is so good they have like food like pre-prepared food and groceries so that's why it's my favorite place on the [ __ ] planet because i can like go there and stock up on groceries but also get a delicious meal anyway we're gonna go there now and i just looked at the clock and it was 333 which is good luck so the angels are on my side they want me to go to erwin i agree i want to go to air one too [ __ ] now that you know the world is opening back up traffic is starting to get bad again i'm sad i mean i'm happy and sad at the same time as casey muskraves once said if you don't know what i'm talking about look up happy and sad by casey musgraves on your spotify on your apple music whatever you listen to music on and just give that song a listen because i think everybody deserves to hear her beautiful voice sing and i love her i do not believe in paying for parking i don't who does the money go to genuinely like i i don't know the answer so don't call me a [ __ ] i encourage you all to stay curious question society daily i'm saying why can park why isn't parking not free where is that money going i don't care i'm going to pay for parking regardless i'm just curious but also it does piss me off i'm just talking out of my ass at this point you know how most people are like don't talk to me until i had my coffee where was i going with that you know what i'm just gonna stop myself because i forgot where i was going with that and then but i honestly don't really know if want i remember so it is officially the best time of the day emma what time of the day is it it's the time of the day where emma sits in her car eats her favorite salad and watches youtube videos on her phone it's like so funny because this is the largest container that they'll give you so i get like one and a half because i'm like that's the perfect size erwin if you're watching this make larger portions for mommy i also have my pink lemonade oh my god i get like excited about this time of the day i love you i love you so much this is my [ __ ] pride and joy so recently i deleted tick tock off of my phone because i refused to scroll through that app ever again but before i deleted the app i saw a video about how to make edible cookie dough out of garbanzo beans this is frightening to me because ew but i also love hummus i'm gonna quickly try to make it as a snack i don't i'm not following a specific recipe i'm just kind of like i saw a few videos about it so i'm just gonna kind of like use my imagination if this is good this is gonna be a fun snack step one open up your can of chickpeas and strain them i will be back eh i'm only making one serving because i don't wanna waste just in case these turn out awful two tablespoons of sugar now i'm gonna add some of this peanut butter powder because i honestly am not sure how i feel about it and like i can't tell if i like it or not now i'm gonna add some flavor drops vanilla water that might have been too much and i feel like that's it and then i'll add chocolate chips after we can see if this was a waste of my time or not okay well regardless of if this ended up good or not it was very easy to make it's kind of good would i recommend that you make it no like i don't think you should waste your time like i think you just make just make it without the chickpeas like you could very easily have a better situation here i also added too much water it doesn't even really need chocolate chips was this a waste of my time no i keep eating it yeah it's not bad all right good talk good talk guys see you later see you when something else interesting happens hi we're having dinner together i'm having some noodles it's weird because it's like 8 p.m which is almost my bedtime and it's bright out are you enjoying watching me eat this or is it gross i can't imagine the sounds that my mouth is making as i'm eating this are pleasant i had a really good day today i did okay i had a good day now it's time for me to read and go to bed it does it looks like it's literally 4 p.m right now i'm gonna eat my noodles i'm gonna read my book and i'm gonna go to bed i just wanted to thank you for hanging out with me today i hope you had fun with me i actually had a

-emma chamberlain",2021-06-15T18:23:28Z,339708,7146796,13506,this is the last time you're ever gonna see me in this house i'm moving [Music] it's kind of emotional weirdly is it i don't know these are my last few moments in this house this is the last time you're gonna see me walk down these steps bye thanks for the memories i really am so emotion like i'm kind of an emotionless [ __ ] like that's the last time i'm gonna close that door i'm out of here so i'm moving basically what happened was i moved into this house a little bit over a year ago and you know i loved it um at the time and it was an amazing house and it was my first house which was a huge um dream of mine is to have my own house and that dream came true in this house so this house holds a very special place in my home but i'm moving so soon because where i live well this house that i'm moving from is kind of in the thick of la it's kind of in the middle of l.a and i'm ready to move to a different area of la a more relaxed area of la a little more removed from the rustle and bustle of los angeles so that's what i'm doing i'm still going to be living in la but just in a more relaxed area i bought a new place but i have to remodel it i have to remodel a lot of it because i bought an old house it's gonna take about six months to fix everything up before it's ready to live in and so in the meantime i'm going to be living in a rental so that's where i'm moving to right now i'm moving to a rental what's funny about this rental is that it's fully furnished like it already has furniture and everything all i have to do is put my clothes in there and that's it so this is not the last moving vlog of the year i will be moving again in approximately six months into my permanent house um but first i have to rent for six months so that's where we're at moving is very stressful i actually had a panic attack today i'm not lying um i had a panic attack because you know when you make a big decision can stir up a lot of emotions so i did have a panic attack today i'm feeling much better now also i think my period's going to be coming in a few days because i feel extremely uncomfortable in my abdomen right now which is usually a telltale sign that my period is coming so i think that that's the reason why i had my freakout but anyway i'm moving now you know now here's my mom my mom has been so helpful everybody comment down below something nice about my mom because my mom has literally made this move possible because without her this would be a [ __ ] mess but she's so organized that she made moving easy aren't we having so much fun moving we're not having panic attacks and stuff it's a blast it's really aren't we having so much fun it's so it's probably the most adventurous fun adventure like i've had in a long time mommy i oh i didn't just call you mommy you just always call me mommy this is the one time that i'm going to call you mommy with my full chest and really just belt it out loud because guess what you um are literally moving for me because i'm so emotionally unstable that you are doing it for me yeah i will see you tomorrow when i moved into my rental you guys don't want to see like you guys don't want to see the [ __ ] chaos okay of all these boxes everywhere and stuff like that you don't want to see that when i'm in my new rental and life is simple again then i will see you but for now we're gonna spend the rest of the evening in the first half of tomorrow moving it good morning so you're probably like emma that's not your bed that's not your nightstand that's not your bed you're right i slept here last night i am officially in the rental shall i give you a little tour we're here oh back in bed the gardener's here okay well it's really [ __ ] loud um anyway post mated a coffee because i don't have my coffee machine actually my coffee machine's broken i had to order a new one like i don't even have a coffee machine right now look at that girl just staring at me i am tired am i tired yes i'm tired but i should probably be productive with my time so i'm thinking okay let's run some errands i need to go to whole foods and i need to go to sorry it's not a booger it's just dead skin i have a rash under my nose right here my mom told me to put ointment on it and i didn't and it's going away anyway so i don't listen to my mom that's so not true i do i think i'm gonna go to whole foods and trader joe's i'm like out of groceries honestly one of my joys in life is going to the grocery store and stocking up on produce it's so fun for me which is so embarrassing i just figured out how to roast carrots and actually make them taste good because whenever like i've eaten other people's roast carrots like they've made roasted carrots and they've made them for me and i've eaten them they've never been cooked properly but the other day i was like you know what i'm gonna try myself i figured it out so maybe i'll get some carrots maybe some cucumber definitely some raspberries definitely some strawberries i actually bought strawberries yesterday and then ate the whole carton in one sitting so i thought i was gonna have strawberries for a few days and then i ate all this so anyway we have to really stock up get ready with me i honestly like never took care of my hair up until recently i didn't realize how much of a difference it makes like i use a leave-in conditioner and um a hair oil and it just makes my hair [ __ ] silky smooth my skin is really dry for some reason ow ah ow ow and then last step to get ready for the grocery store ow fit check okay honestly i used to like make a little effort every morning to get kind of dressed before i'd run errands or do anything like that but recently like i can't get myself to wear something besides sweats in public i've always been somebody that liked to wear sweatpants and like comfy pants out in public i used to wear old navy pajama fleece drawstring pants everywhere but that's just me like i like being comfortable i've always liked being comfortable the weird thing about moving for me is that like it takes me forever to feel at home and i don't know why that is maybe i'm just like really weird about energy and [ __ ] like i don't know i'm making it a lot deeper than it needs to be but i i really like the rental so i'm excited about that i mean i definitely was a little bit anxious last night because it was unfamiliar moving is possibly one of my least favorite things to do on the planet i feel like for the past four years every time i get like moved into a place like everything is in its place everything's organized everything looks great right when i get to that point right when i get to that point i move why do i do this so when i was younger i always wanted like an excess of clothes and an excess of makeup and an excess of jewelry i always craved that and wanted that as a kid now that i make my own money i kind of have more freedom to like make those dreams come true right which is amazing but now i'm like it's too much and it's stressing me out it makes me feel cluttered almost and it makes me feel like i don't get proper use out of all of my things because i have so many things now whereas when i was younger i didn't really have that much stuff right so like i felt like every pair of shoes that i bought every uh makeup product that i bought every skin care product that i brought always got used to like completion now i'm like stuck with all this stuff and my like life feels cluttered so i'm really actually i'm not [ __ ] with you guys i'm really gonna change my life right now i've decided i'm gonna get rid of a bunch of stuff donate as much stuff as i can to charity some stuff's gonna have to be thrown out whatever it may be donate as much as i can just live with less clutter this is growth you guys are witnessing growth sorry i should not be removing my hands from the wheel if i'm being honest i'm going to trader joe's for one thing and it's a salad dressing but it's so good it's called green goddess but it tastes like pesto and it's so [ __ ] good it has like avocado blended up in it [ __ ] so i'm going all the way there just for that is that stupid a little bit here's another thing i slept for like six hours last night i'm used to getting a solid eight hours and now all of a sudden tonight last night see i can't even talk last night i only got six hours and my god it is a f i am affected which is so funny because when i was younger i would just stay up all night and i would thrive actually i was not thriving i was i don't think i was maybe i was just more used to it ah this parking garage is so narrow y'all this parking garage literally why okay why are parking garages in la just not simple it's like a [ __ ] maze in here i keep following the arrows to find the elevator oh there it is it wasn't actually that hard i do have to fart though i'm very constipated right now sorry tmi and that also makes me pissed off but anyway we're at trader joe's now so let's go get our ones our singular salad dressing [Music] oh [ __ ] look how cute this elevator is day equals may i'm no longer grumpy okay we're done when i get home we'll do a little grocery haul it's gonna be [ __ ] boring though because i just bought only like fresh stuff there we go now my face is in the light i have a zit oh let's pop it ow i popped it i hate having acne but i do love popping zits i know that's gross but like i've always loved it like when one of my friends says it i'm like let's go you know okay if you can hear that loud sound we're just gonna act like it's not happening the gardeners are here but we're gonna do a grocery haul hard-boiled eggs that are already peeled the best invention ever raspberries my favorite a bell pepper red literally so many strawberries some arugula and some lemons some tofu because vegetarian life i got some dates i haven't eaten a date in a really long time but i saw somebody eating dates with peanut butter and i remembered how good that snack is little mini cucumbers these are way better than the big cucumbers the big cucumbers are like soggy always i hate that literally so much broccoli and then last but not least i got colorful mini carrots oh no that's not all i got so i got this jar of spicy kosher dill pickles pickles i love spicy and i love pickles so let's see yes i mean those are delicious so love that then i got three of my salad dressings it's avocado green onion lemon juice chives basil and garlic and it definitely gives you garlic bread so i eat it only when i'm going to be by myself all day but it's so good [Music] that was fun back to bed for me that was productive now i get to lay in bed and wait until the movers get here and unload all the boxes then it's gonna be grind time while i'm in bed i thought i'd talk about our sponsor for today's video which is public.com and this is such a cool sponsor and i'm very excited to talk about it public.com is an investing app where you can buy and sell stocks follow investors share ideas the whole nine yards as you can see here you can discover stocks it gives you a bunch of interesting info as you can see here like oat milk is up 18 cents today that's cool um you can scroll down on your feed and you know read interesting stuff from investors and once you've added your banking info you can invest through the app and it's great i'm not really big into investing i don't really know much about it i know my dad's always been into it but i am definitely a rookie and i think that public.com is such a great place to start because it's very beginner friendly and i think that stocks and investing and stuff like that is so intimidating when you're just starting and that's why i think public.com is so great because it's like very easy to digest mentally like it's not super complicated the app is free and you can start with as little as one dollar you don't actually have to buy full shares of stocks you can actually buy portions of stocks which is really cool fractions or slices of stocks what also is cool about public is that you can see what other people are investing in like i follow cody on there cody ko my friend and i can see what he's investing in and that's really cool because he's really smart public also doesn't share your data and information so you can feel secure and safe while using that you'll get a free stock when you go to public.com emma get started today follow me on there my username is my name emma chamberlain um i'm not invested in anything yet because i'm doing a little bit more research on stocks and how they work first before i actually start investing once again go to public.com emma for a free stock thank you public for sponsoring this video you guys are really awesome check it out i don't know what i'm supposed to be doing right now like i'm in this weird like random it's like random right now because it's like okay i can't unpack anything yet because i'm still waiting for the movers to bring all my stuff over here i just like don't know what i'm supposed to be doing with my time right now you know what i'm saying like i'm just gonna lay here and go on youtube and tick tock i really need to start reading a new book i have two books right now ready to read at any given moment i have to kill a mockingbird here and i have pride and prejudice here and i think i'm gonna read pride and prejudice what is it about spirited elizabeth bennett is one of a family of five daughters i don't know what to kill a mockingbird is about it's a gripping heart-wrenching and holy remarkable tale of coming of age in a south poisoned by virtually prejudice okay this looks interesting both of them having it seems a female protagonist which i've not read a book that has a female protagonist yet they've all been male protagonists so that could be kind of fun and hashtag relatable because i'm a woman oh look how like cute the pages look for the next minute or so you're going to watch me organize my fridge and it's going to be extremely satisfying so enjoy i'm done it looks exactly like my fridge at home kind of boring but fridge is done fridge is done now should i do the pantry i kind of love this like honestly i kind of like the organizing process like it's kind of amazing and fun it's also nice i'm also getting rid of stuff guys i got rid of so much like old food that i forgot was in my fridge like it's amazing now we're working on the pantry ow i think i said ow because i thought you're gonna put it on my toe i'm always ready guys i'm tired let me show you what i've done i've done a little bit more but that's all the interesting stuff you guys this is i hate this there's just so much [ __ ] so i made a little coffee station i ordered a new espresso machine and it hasn't come yet so just imagine that it's there imagine that there's an espresso machine right there i have my little kettle little matcha chamberlain coffee and then in here i have beans and tea this one helps me poop don't judge me my mom hasn't been here for the past few hours because she's been running other errands so i've been doing all this by myself and i really need my mom here i need my mommy but look at the view i can't lie i do love that i want to take a break but if i take a break then i won't start again i'm gonna get back to work i just hit the eight hour mark and pac or unpacking for eight hours i haven't even started unpacking my clothes i think my period's coming or something because i'm like so emo like i feel like normally i'm pretty like resilient with projects like this but today i was just like getting pissed off i was like throwing [ __ ] around honestly that's why i wasn't filming um the second half of the day of me unpacking because i was like i don't think anybody wants to see me ripping boxes open and like throwing things everywhere violently not a good look for now i'm just gonna lay in bed and enjoy being in bed the kitties are meowing at me stop oh my god i am so tired i am so tired right now first time cooking in the new house i'm going to roast some vegetables i had a very stressful day a little bit not just be a whiny [ __ ] baby so i feel like this is good for me ah i didn't cut into my finger just now but i cut into my nail it was a very bizarre sensation i really wish i had something to say but i'm i think i don't have a brain anymore i've never ever been a big carrot girl like i've always hated carrots but ever since i figured out how to roast them and make them tasty now i'm like a carrot girl for sure i've never seen like white carrots before it's kind of crazy i always almost accidentally leave the sticker on and i mean i feel like it wouldn't kill me it actually might even be good for me can i tell you something that happened to me today when i was off camera actually i don't know if i should tell that story i don't know if that's a good one for the internet fine i'll tell you my period was a day late and my anxiety started to convince me that i was pregnant um so today when the camera was off i did take a pregnancy test i wasn't pregnant i'm like 30 seconds late to my period and i'm like y'all i'm pregnant i miss one day my period and i go onto youtube and make a new account so that i can start a family channel i start coming up with like click bait baby ideas when i miss my period for one second i start coming up with baby prank ideas pranking my baby into saying [ __ ] as its first word see how iconic would that be check it out i'm lazy so instead of trying to evenly coat all the veggies and olive oil i'm just gonna spray it with olive oil then we're gonna take salt i just basically salt my veggies and then i season them later now anyway that was a fun activity now i have veggies for the week see look this is good i can start crying but i won't because i stay strong for you i stay strong for you that was an early forehead kiss okay it's been a week so much has happened so basically i'm fully moved in now but the chaos that ensued off screen was unbelievable my mom and i were trying to move me into this place by ourselves with virtually no help and after about two days of doing that we both had a mental breakdown i had way too much stuff my mom and i just couldn't do it by ourselves we hired an organizer which i didn't even know was something like i didn't even know that that was a type of person that existed um and now i'm fully organized i'm somebody who doesn't like to ask for help if i wanted to i could have unpacked and organized everything myself i know that but hiring an organizer was the best decision in my life i have a new macho recipe it's not really that complicated there's just one key ingredient so as you can see i'm making matcha right now hot but we will be adding ice in the secret ingredient so now we have our matcha here's the secret ingredient caramel nut pods i've never tried this flavor and i ended up trying it in coffee and it was good but then i tried it in matcha and it was life-changing so what i do is i add a decent amount of our nut pod here then then i add water then put some ice in there so good the caramel nut pod is the secret ingredient and so random like caramel and matcha doesn't sound like it would be good together but it doesn't really taste caramelly it's just like buttery almost i can't explain it but it's so good we're in bed i thought i would be brutally honest here for some reason moving sent me into a mental breakdown spiral i do not know why i think it was just because it was so stressful but now that i'm like fully moved in i feel a lot better i thought i would show you some of the things that are organized now just because i want to share because they're exciting and she did such a my organizer did such an amazing job so i thought i would show you some stuff first we have my main closet love that she also did my jewelry the most exciting thing that i think that she did was my spice drawer i've always wanted to have a spice drawer like this please look at this you're going to freak out like are you kidding me you guys know how i feel about organization i was so stoked a lot of the other stuff was boring like you know not anything interesting i mean this is actually cool so organized we're here everything's good all is well my mental breakdown is almost over like i i know we're almost done i journaled this morning which i think helped i've been really trying to journal i also started a new book the razor's edge by summerset manga [Applause] it is literally five hours later basically i took a nap and then i took a shower and then now i'm laying in my bed with a face mask i'm a simple girl i don't really plan on getting out of bed for the rest of the day sue me that is my what's the word prerogative definition of prerogative correct that is my prerogative but anyway guys i got through the move we're moved in i hope you guys enjoyed hanging out with me during this process was it a train wreck absolutely are we surprised no this is exactly what we would expect but anyway i hope you guys had fun hanging out with me um i love you guys and appreciate you per usual another one another one sorry okay keep it real stay strong out there we can do this whatever you're going through whatever is challenging you at this time i believe in all of us all right see ya [Music] you

-emma chamberlain",2021-06-06T16:12:19Z,283360,6258662,6619,oh my god it's so sad what happened my mommy's in town your guys's favorite look at my hair no no no more mommy content the people love you [Music] good morning everybody i woke up this morning to my espresso machine being broken it's been making my coffee a little bit weird but i haven't been able to figure out what the problem was so i was just kind of ignoring the problem and then today just like everything blew up in my face i no longer have an espresso machine that was upsetting but in other news today is my last day as a teenager when you're watching this my birthday will have far past and it will all be a memory my teen years have been something else it was really quite a decade for me and it's kind of sad to see my teenager years end but also not really because i don't really care but i want to live it right today i'm going to have a fun day and i'm going to [ __ ] make it fun and i'm going to force myself to not lay in bed all day like i have been for the past six months i have a few things in my mind a few ideas but first i'm going to the gym i know it's kind of out of character i'm turning into a gym rat like i've been really genuinely like unironically genuinely enjoying going to the gym recently it's almost like one of these things where i'm like i don't want anyone to find out because i'm like embarrassed for some reason there's really nothing embarrassing about it it's extremely normal but i'm i don't know like there's something embarrassing about it for me like i'm embarrassed i can't put a finger on it i got my birthday nails done yesterday they're these 3d bubble color bubbles i'm not a big birthday person and honestly it kind of makes me anxious it makes me anxious when people do nice things for me so you can imagine birthdays for me are kind of anxiety-inducing because it's just people doing things for me and saying nice things to me all day so i'm not the biggest birthday person i don't really care about doing big stuff i don't really have any big birthday plans it's probably just going to be like any other day maybe go to dinner this is kind of a big birthday i mean this birthday you know i'm going from teen hood to my 20s so even though i'm not really planning anything crazy i still want it to be a good day and i definitely want to look good which is why today i'm going to try to search for a birthday outfit i have not gone shopping in probably a month and a half but i do want to try to find a birthday outfit i don't care if people wish me a happy birthday couldn't care less i just want to wear a [ __ ] dope outfit on my birthday i also was thinking i kind of want to get another piercing i also want to change out my nose ring which i can't do by myself i need to go in and then they do it so i'm gonna try to do that today but lord knows like whatever if that's gonna happen oh and i also want to go get myself a new espresso machine as my birthday gift to myself but first we're starting out with the gym because weirdly enough i actually enjoy going to the gym last workout as a 19 year old i need to go home and shower and then we can figure out what's next you know what i smell like i smell like a cup of instant noodles like instant ramen like it's not sweat smell it's like salt like i smell like salt i'm gonna google it does that mean something is something wrong with me it means i have a lack of sodium in my body oh or i've been eating too much salt wait what's the answer okay i guess i'm not gonna worry about it anyway see you in a second i'm back and i'm clean what are we doing today it's 11 in the morning i blow dried my hair i don't know i was feeling fancy um i have a few things that i want to do today and i wrote them down on a list number one go shopping for a birthday outfit number two go to the container store and get a bunch of different little containers so i can organize my refrigerator i don't know how to justify that but i would like to do that today i want to try to find a new espresso machine and try to buy one i would like to get an ear piercing because i just like feel like i'm due like i'm long overdue for a new piercing i want to go to the grocery store and buy some sort of cake cookie cupcake something fun for my birthday tomorrow but i want to pick it out myself because i'm picky and those are all the errands i want to try to run today i need to get some caffeine in me so we're going to go get a matcha shocker are you guys surprised okay hey what the [ __ ] oh my god this [ __ ] literally was just speeding down my street and he was like swerving around my street anyway and then he flipped me off um something's in the air in l.a bad vibes anyway i've been very unmotivated to do anything recently but i woke up today at 7am with this like burning passion for life and i was like i'm going to get piercings today i'm going to go shopping i'm going to go to the gym i'm going to do all of it and i it feels good basically the reason why i'm saying this is because um if you're watching this and you're like i have no motivation to do anything right now and i feel like i never will again let this be comforting for you that i have literally not wanted to get out of bed for like a month and today i woke up and i just wanted to get out of bed it happens you can't predict when it's gonna happen but if you just keep pushing through it'll pass and today i feel energized and motivated and happy and it's great i think i'm gonna go to one of my favorite vintage stores to try to find an outfit let me take this okay i'm gonna go into this vintage store crossing my fingers i'm going for something not too crazy but something a little bit out of my comfort zone maybe let's see what we find [Music] did i buy things yes i actually had a relatively successful shopping trip i didn't get like a full outfit like a full birthday outfit but i got a few pieces that i can mix with pieces that i already have time for a haul first thing i got is not really for a birthday outfit although i may wear this on my birthday because it's very me it says it's a vintage tee that says leave me alone i love it next i got this is another this i'm definitely not wearing on my birthday because it's not warm enough but i bought this long sheer black skirt that i can wear as a bathing suit cover-up it just fit really well okay this i want to wear if i leave my house past 7 p.m on my birthday this jacket it's so cute and i was thinking if i'm feeling really spicy i could wear this underneath it's a lot i love that i think that's so cute like the colors match perfectly with some black jeans or some black leather pants or a black skirt oh black skirt that's possibly my birthday outfit and then i also got two birthday gifts for myself two pairs of sunglasses little vintage sunnies first we have these i don't know i just like them and i know that they're dior but i can promise you that they were only a hundred dollars which isn't that bad it's my [ __ ] birthday okay i also got these cute wait these are so cute i'm happy i'm a happy girl okay next i think i'm going to go to the container store which if you don't know what that is it's exactly what it sounds like it's a store that sells a bunch of different kinds of containers and i think i'm gonna get refrigerator organizers because let me tell you i saw this photo on pinterest of like a super organized fridge i saw this photo and i was like i have to do this with my own fridge because now that i cook for myself it's like it's time and i was gonna order everything and do it but then i was like you know what i'm just gonna go to the container store pick out everything it's gonna be an absolute ball and now that i'm turning 20 i'm basically a grandma so doing things like organizing my fridge fits my new vibe i remember when i was younger my mom was obsessed with the container store because she was like this is the best place on the planet because it's just a store with a bunch of different containers and ways to organize things like a bunch of different drawer organizers like all kinds of organizers that you can imagine any kind of plastic organizer that you can imagine the container store has this store was like my mom's favorite store when i was growing up and i was always like can you shut up shut up and then now i'm older and i'm like girl i'm sorry for everything i said i get it tell me why that was so fun tell me why i just had the most fun i've ever had in the container store it's the most bizarre concept for a store it's literally just containers but i got so much good [ __ ] i'm gonna organize the [ __ ] out of my refrigerator later refrigerator later but i do have some bad news the espresso machine that i want is only available in a store that's 45 minutes away from me not worth it you know it's actually been so awkward today i've gotten like multiple birthday texts for some reason everybody thinks that today is my birthday it's not my birthday today it's tomorrow do i tell them that it's not my birthday or do i just play along now we're going to the grocery store so i can pick up some birthday sweets because at the end of the day the only person you really have is you and i'm not going to rely on somebody else to get me a cake or to get me cupcakes or something i'm going to get them myself because i know what i like best anyway i also want to get more apricots because apricots are in season and they're absolutely [ __ ] delicious right now the grocery store is very busy right now and i'm contemplating going later but i'm also like i'm here what do i do what the [ __ ] is this person doing somebody's literally trying to park in a spot that's not a real spot oh my god you're so [ __ ] stupid seriously am i having road rage today or is everybody just driving badly this is like the most errands i've ever i've run in probably six months like i have not been to three stores consecutively in like two months like normally at this point i'd be tired and i'd be like [ __ ] it i'm going home but i have like energy today so this is like natural i did have an energy drink but i drink these every day so emma turning 20. maybe emma's turning 20 and her depression is going away but i'm not gonna get wishful thinking because it has not gone away for six seven years so but i'm having a good time so grocery store time [Music] grocery store run was a success i got some cupcakes that have ingredients in it that won't hurt my stomach look what else i got are you [ __ ] kidding me i also got strawberries and broccoli and two nectarines but i'm not gonna pull them out of the bag because you've [ __ ] seen those fruits and veggies before like you don't need to see them again wait i kind of want to try a little bit of the cupcake now but i'm like emma no save it for your [ __ ] birthday i'm gonna save it for my birthday some girls watching me film right now and judging me so i'm gonna drive away before i discuss how delicious that was oh my god she's [ __ ] telling her friends she's like telling her she's like whispering to her friends right now as if i cannot see as if i do not have two eyes i see that you're talking [ __ ] about me to your friends did you know it's my birthday week [ __ ] i bet that girl does not know it's my birthday week and she's [ __ ] bullying me i try to buy desserts that have ingredients in it that won't hurt my stomach because like if it's my birthday i don't wanna have a stomachache you know what i'm saying but these like you know gluten-free vegan uh dairy-free sweets sweets that are gluten-free dairy-free vegan stuff like that when you get those they're hit or miss like you don't know if it's gonna be good or not luckily that one was good you know it's kind of funny how like freaked out i get when people watch me film or like judge me because in la people are judgmental sometimes it's just you know what do you expect right but it's funny how i like care sometimes because then when i really think about it i'm like they're never gonna see me again there's no reason for me to care okay so my mom's in town she wanted to try the cupcake because me and my mom have similar stomach issues and so she can eat this but also don't eat too much of it because this is my birthday well i have another one no you have to have the frosting i know no the frosting oh my god that's amazing right are you cutting a piece how am i gonna put my mouth on them it is hard it's so did you just say that's what she said no isn't it so good you can have the rest i know that's fun very delicious thank you for sharing you are so welcome queen how did that just take my day you know what time it is it's time to organize the fridge i feel like this is gonna be fun but i feel like also i might start getting bored after 20 minutes so we will see okay so first i'm gonna put all of my fruits and veggies into these little containers that are supposed to make them last longer so first we have some raspberries i don't know if this is efficient like i don't know how long i'm gonna be able to do this you know like before i start getting frustrated we'll see maybe i'll be able to keep this going okay my strawberries don't fit this is already going bad i'll eat one oh wait those are moldy are you kidding me i just bought more i just spent like 20 dollars on moldy strawberries okay this is my next container strawberries wait look how nice this is all of my little drinks in their own little container i put all my sparkling water all my sparkling waters into one is this a waste of time all my coffee creamer is this am i what am i doing oh my god they're too big for my refrigerator guys this is quickly backfiring oh no nothing fits nothing fits i'm not gonna let this ruin my day because it's my [ __ ] birthday but i did get to organize this it's honestly a little bit less messy than before so that's kind of exciting but for the rest of the fridge um i am in pain mentally um but i'm really gonna try to make it work so give me another like hour and we'll see what i come up with this is not going well it's just not helping like it's not making my fridge more organized like it has made no difference but on the other hand this is actually kind of amazing there are special containers to keep your fruits and veggies fresh so at least we have that i'm going to put everything back in my fridge and move on to another activity for the day because i'm a little bit devastated and frustrated um so i can't i don't want to think about this anymore okay wait honestly i just rearranged things for like an hour and i feel really good like i just wasted half the day doing this but i actually feel like it looks good now you just have to ignore the fourth row because that's not organized right now but the rest looks pretty good i mean it's kind of good like i have all my almond milks here and then i have all my fruit juices here there's like cranberry in the back and lemon and lime and then i have my creamer the ones in the front are my mom's but you know then here i have all my sparkling waters then i have some of my homemade egg white bites then i have some hummus and then i have my mom's leftovers and then i have some drinks here all of my fresh fruits and veggies and some leftovers and then vegan meat and vegan cheese and some salsa and pickle i mean it's kind of random it's still random but it's better than before like i think it's more aesthetically pleasing i mean that's pretty aesthetically pleasing i mean listen we made it work i actually ended up using all the containers too i found a place for all of them so this wasn't useless hi um do you guys have any availability today for two ear piercings and um a nose ring change yeah when are you gonna come in i could be here at two yeah they're at two okay perfect great see you at two okay so we're getting piercings now i think i'm gonna get i don't want to get anything on this ear i think i'm gonna get wait what side do i sleep on i don't remember um i think i'm gonna get one right here and then one i don't know i don't really know yet to be honest i really don't know i'm literally gonna wing it i'm just gonna wing it and then i'm gonna get a gold nose ring because i've had this silver one for way too long and it's pissing me off but anyway i need to literally leave right now because it's 1 40 and my appointment is at two am i spontaneous today guys literally when have you seen me with this much energy i am on one today so the funny thing about me and piercings is that i get piercings all the time but it's really like hit or miss whether or not they get infected with me because i have very sensitive skin so like my body doesn't react well to piercings so i like get them and there's like a 50 50 chance that they'll heal so i've gotten like this cartilage up here done multiple times but it's gotten infected every time and so lord knows whether or not these are actually gonna last or if they're gonna get infected but i i don't know all my piercings right now are healed up pretty well so i feel like there's a good chance there's a prom well not really there's not really a promising chance maybe i'll just get one today i said two but maybe i'll just do one because i need to kind of cool down i'll do two [ __ ] it like whatever chances are one of them will get infected so then at least i'll have the other one i just got here i'm warning you i'm not gonna film in there because i am very intimidated by people who have lots of tattoos and lots of piercings and i'm going into a tattoo and piercing shop therefore i will not be filming in there because i'm always scared of the people in there like they're always intimidating without fail so i'll see you after wish me luck here are my ears now here's my nose ring now and i'll see you after you guys okay number one look at my little gold nose ring so much better and it's also smaller so it looks better on my nose see and then i got this one on top right here that's the only one i got because i was like i'm not gonna overdo it today i'm not in the mood to overdo it today so i just got that one but i'm obsessed with it i love it i think it looks so cute and i like my new little gold nose ring so that was very successful another little birthday gift to myself some new jewelry and a new piercing just two besties chilling in bed so ow my ear piercing is hurting i am planning on reading my book i'm reading 1984 by george orwell i'm almost done i have approximately 40 pages left i'm gonna read some of this right now and then i'm also going to write in my journal um for the next say probably 45 minutes and then i actually am going to dinner not really like a birthday dinner but like kind of a birthday dinner with my friends three of them i don't know that's actually all i have we can get ready together and it'll be fun but for now i think i need to have some chill relaxing bedtime with my book and my journal it's good for me i got dressed and it only took me an hour only an hour let's see if you can see it in here so it's time to get ready i i don't know if i like i might change my shirt the shirt might change guys i swear to god i've done i did more today than i've done in two weeks so i'm actually exhausted and the thought of going to dinner right now is scaring me because i'm exhausted i also kind of hate my outfit so i'm gonna have to really think about that i think the reason why i'm confused about this outfit is because it's not comfortable today we're doing quick makeup quick and dirty i don't think i like my outfit i don't i hate it okay well i will be changing my outfit after this but i will finish my makeup first and then we can have an entire another crisis about my outfit i don't want to be predictable that's why i was like okay today we're coming out with the plaid pant but the plaid pant is giving me a wedgie in all areas every time i use this cream bronzer i'm really like risking my life here because i'm like this could either look really good or really bad and like i'm i take a risk every time i use it see that like looks not good oh it looks so much worse on camera it looks bad in person too but listen nobody said it had to be perfect i tried to pluck my eyebrows a little bit last night because they were getting out of control and i think i might have actually did a good job and i've never in my life been able to pluck my eyebrows but i tried last night and i like really took my time and like really was methodical and thoughtful i think i actually did kind of a good job i mean they're still a mess but like they were like bad yesterday like they were really bad birthdays are always crazy because it's like who's gonna come out of the woodwork and text me that hasn't texted me in like a year like that's exciting it's like what [ __ ] is gonna decide to come out of the blue and text me happy birthday my makeup's not going well today um it's safe to say that but it's okay cause i'm gonna blend it with my finger until it looks good it's fine it's fine i'm also getting irritable because my ear is aching from the piercing and it's like the most frustrating ache because it's like not that bad but it's just like dull we're doing some highlight i'm mad about having to change my outfit like i don't want to change my outfit but i like know i need to because i hate it once my lips get drawn on everything changes like i am a brand new [ __ ] every time brand new [ __ ] add a little shimmer and shine last but not least mascara listen i'm quick how long does that take me like 10 minutes ow oh [ __ ] out we did it we're ready i'm gonna go change my outfit but i'm not taking you with me because you don't need to go through that like it's going to be excruciating for me so like i don't want you guys to have to go through that go through that i'm not happy i was so tempted to wear my birthday outfit a day early because it looked so good sorry i didn't show you we settled on this boring [ __ ] black skirt pink purple shirt in a little cardigan whatever i'm done but anyway i need to go to the oh my god i'm like talking too fast and i can't get sentences out correctly i need to go to dinner i'm excited even though i don't like my outfit that much lord knows i'll probably change three more times even though i don't have time anyway i love you guys thank you for hanging out with me today on my last day of being a teenager by the time you're watching this i will have been 20 for probably like two weeks so the hype will be over but i'm glad that i got to spend today with you and i love you so much and i appreciate you so much there was your forehead kiss there's another one just for good measure i'm out of here i'm gonna go to dinner now in my boring outfit bye love you [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-05-30T20:30:18Z,257980,5948863,7374,[Music] good morning [Music] thank you to google for sponsoring this portion of today's video when we're constantly on the internet looking at things it's very easy to see something and immediately look at it as fact because we saw it on the internet but the truth of the matter is not everything that we see on the internet is true google makes it a huge priority and encourages us to look at information on the internet critically and to do research ourselves when you see something on the internet it's important to make sure that it's credible always take a minute to step back look at the information that you're consuming check to see if it's real something that i've been searching up on the internet recently is vitamins which might sound random but i'm a vegetarian i want to make sure that i'm getting the proper vitamins that i need to be healthy and happy and i've been doing a lot of research on the b12 vitamin reading a lot of notes from scientists and from dietitians and things like that to see the benefits and so i have been taking b12 for the past few weeks and i mean hopefully it's doing something good for me i use google to research all of that and a lot of their work goes into making sure that quality and reliable sources are at the top of our searches in conclusion google and i so let's be better consumers of information together do our research and be thoughtful and critical it's important especially today big thank you to google for sponsoring this portion of today's video now let's hang out for the next 20 minutes or so hi sweet declan anyway there was your declan fix for the morning declan you do need to get off mommy though you need to get off of mommy i know i know you want to hang out with mommy right now but mommy needs to go sit on the couch you can come with mommy to the couch but no you need to get off of me he does not want to get off my lap this morning honestly i'm honored like i love when animals love me like it makes me feel like i'm special and different like i feel like it like makes me like feel loved i swear to god i've never sat on my couch in a youtube video before in my life so this is very weird i woke up late today i just kept pressing snooze on the alarm i feel like declan wants something from me like he's giving me a lot more attention than usual i really don't have anything on the agenda today but i do have one priority and it's that i need to do a little self-care routine because i have been so bad about like doing my skincare routine and like shaving my legs and stuff like that just because i've been so lazy for whatever reason it just hasn't been at the top of my list of priorities and so i'm starting to feel a little bit gross i i can't explain it it happens to me sometimes it's like when i just really am like doing the bare minimum every time i'm in the shower like i'm in the shower and i just wash my body i don't even wash my hair i don't shave my legs i don't do anything and then i don't do my skincare routine i just get straight into bed like when i do that too many days in a row i start to feel kind of gross i feel like i'm due to like really make myself feel good another thing is that i want to paint my toenails today so that's gonna be so exciting and i mean that's pretty much it i really don't have anything on the agenda when was the last time i had something on my agenda before i get into the shower hear me out the other day i was at the grocery store and i bought an apricot and i was like okay i don't know why i'm buying this i'm just buying it because i'm bored apricots are so good every season i have like a new fruit that i'm obsessed with during the winter it was raspberries i just couldn't stop eating raspberries the summer before that it was plums like i was eating plums like every day all day every day i think that my summer fruit this season or maybe my spring fruit i don't know is apricots okay oh my god they are so good and you take out their little pit do not sleep on apricots these are so good i also need to eat breakfast i'm having my usual breakfast this morning of spicy hummus and my egg white bites i've been eating these egg bites every morning for like a month i eat the same little yogurt bowl like i eat the same things every day so i was thinking maybe later i try to cook something new because i'm sick of eating the same things every day it's boring of me it's not interesting of me so that could be potentially on the agenda this is good for me this is good for me it's good for me to get in the shower it's a lot easier to lay in bed but you know what i know that i'm gonna feel good if i get in the shower and i shave and i wash my hair and i moisturize my body it's gonna feel great it's gonna be worth it on the other side i'll see you after the shower i feel scrumptious post shower it was so worth it i feel amazing it's always like before i take a shower i'm always like ugh i just like don't want to do it and then afterwards i feel so incredibly amazing maybe i'll do a face mask like honestly i'm like already you know i did a good job like i i got in the shower i shaved i wash my hair i brush my teeth in there because i like efficiency sometimes when i um i'm board i'll go to makeup stores or skin care stores and buy random products i actually do this more often than i wish to admit um and then i try them out so today we're going to be trying a new sheet mask that i found looked fascinating i like sheet masks on days that i'm feeling lazy because they're just so easy and there's also so many fun ones to try who knows if they even do anything but it feels good i feel gorgeous right now it's book reading time just give me like 30 minutes to read and then we can resume with the day i just feel like this is good for me time for me to paint my toes it's a self-care day i don't know there's something about gloomy weather that just makes me not able to do anything as much as i like getting my nails done in a salon i find that it just takes so much time that like i like to do my toes myself because they just decline you need to not get your cat hair in my pedicure because i will be mommy will be mad also i bought this you can't see it you see i bought it like a year ago so that i could do gel nails on myself and honestly guys i'm not kidding it's a game changer because i hate waiting for nail polish to dry gel manicures and pedicures are just so much better because there's no drying time you just put it in this machine and then it's done it's like the best creation ever today i'm using a shimmery pink color i don't know if i'm gonna like it but we're gonna find out okay i don't really like this color at all but whatever like i actually hate this color like i regret choosing it just now but you know sorry i really don't like this color i really hate this color i don't like how it turned out actually you know what now that i put on the second coat it's a little bit cuter i didn't really shave my ankle very well it's kind of still prickly a little bit in some spots honestly i was so passionate about nail art when i was younger like i literally was obsessed with doing nail art on myself and on other people it was like my number one hobby um and now i can barely paint my toes so it's crazy that i was more talented at painting nails as like a middle schooler than i am now but see and that was quick it took me like less than 10 minutes to do my own little pedicure does it look good not the best but it doesn't look terrible you know recently i've been struggling to like find things to do in my free time like when i have free time i don't know what to do because okay well what am i going to do my pedicure does look like the five-year-old did it you can't really see it but i don't want to put my foot closer to the screen because that's probably kind of gross i want to see the final product fine i'll show you it's better than nothing when in doubt remind yourself it's better than nothing it's what i do guys look the sun came out omg now i don't have an excuse to lay in bed anymore i don't know if i'm happy or sad about it yet i'm still deciding i think i'm happy about it because i really need to not be in bed nothing better than sitting outside with a iced tea caffeine free by the way let's brainstorm together let's brainstorm together things that i can do instead of going shopping now let me tell you my mind is blank maybe it's okay that i don't have anything to do maybe it's good maybe it's good for me maybe it's what i need or maybe i could go shopping no no no i got nothing guys i got literally nothing like i literally cannot think of anything to do what to do when you were bored okay i just found an article that says 64 things to do when you're bored number one watch reality tv don't want to do that trying not to watch tv two watch a classic movie no three read a great essay no start reading a book already did that play a video game absolutely not i had a little video game phase like a year ago where i was like playing video games every single day for like eight hours a day and i really don't want to go back down that that rabbit hole you know put together a puzzle no give yourself a pedicure i already did that meditate no make bread no no no no write a song okay i'm gonna write a song right now i used to go shopping when i was bored then i had to stop because i became a hoarder and now i have too many clothes in my closet and now i don't know what to do with them because i have too much and i've been keeping and i have not gotten rid of clothes and i still have clothes from high school in my class i but what do you do when when you have nothing to do and you want to go shopping but shopping makes you feel like poo because then you have too much stuff and all that stuff [Music] but that was enough this article told me i could clean my makeup brushes i don't want to do that or wash the windows no maybe i'll just sit out here and enjoy the sun it's not even really that sunny out so what did we learn from this video embrace the boredom and see what will come out of it hey you know what i'm going to actually use this as an experiment i am for the next few hours until further notice i'm just going to remain bored i'm just going to let myself be bored i'm just going to accept the boredom and i'm gonna see what happens i've decided to embrace the chill nature of the day like today is just clearly meant to be a chill day and i'm gonna go and treat myself to a matcha and you know what i'm gonna treat myself to a little bit of lip balm today is my day why is the lighting like that i tend to feel guilty when i take a day off and i'm not sure why that is but i've always kind of been like that like i feel like i always need to be working on something or doing something or like bettering myself in some way but in reality i think that you need days where you just don't do anything and so today i'm going to embrace my relaxing day and i'm not going to fight against it and i'm not going to be like emma you're not doing enough emma shut it shut up just enjoy it idiot you know what else i might do i might go and get my favorite salad from my favorite salad place see look how fun this is matcha salad painting my toenails showering is my mantra ready yes it is be back oh my god it's one of the paparazzi dudes anyway i'm scared i hope he doesn't see me i mean not that he that was conceited of me i hope he doesn't see me it was so awkward when i was picking up my matcha i saw somebody who i'm like pretty sure i've met before but i like couldn't tell you when i met her or if i for sure have met her or if i've just seen photos of her on the internet also why are there paparazzi everywhere right now they're everywhere there must be some sort of crazy event what i'm about to do right now is i'm about to go get my favorite salad and then eat it in my car and watch youtube videos my greatest joy in life why is it so good why is it so good it makes kale like just taste deliciouser than it is why is it so good why do i get so much joy from this it seems wrong i wish you guys could taste it so you could understand because i feel like you there's no way you can understand through the screen i'm in love with it let's see what i'm gonna watch on the internet today nothing is interesting me why is nothing interesting me i've never had to look this long for something to watch while i eat my luxurious salad okay i'm going to watch a short 13 minute video about why the u.s builds houses incorrectly i just got home and i got the random urge to do my makeup this hasn't happened to me in a really long time i have not done my makeup voluntarily in probably a month so i'm just gonna do my makeup um also i saw this hack where you go like this and then okay it didn't work i'm like really gonna make this fun like i never like clip back my hair and stuff because i'm always too lazy but i'm like you know what i have nothing better to do today i'm really gonna enjoy this process we're already off to a bad start because i can't find my foundation oh it's literally right here boredom maybe isn't so bad because i'm actually like enjoying like now i i think i'm enjoying myself now i think you hit a certain point when you're bored where then you're like okay i don't want to be bored anymore i'm just gonna enjoy it and i think i'm like reaching that point now where i'm like enjoying it while i was um off camera i called my dad for a little bit and i was talking to him about being bored and like how i actually think it might be important now that i'm thinking about it and he and i and i told him that and i was like what do you think and he was like i completely agree because i think that being bored forces you to be creative i was driving home just now and while i was driving i was listening to music and i was thinking about how fun it would be to try to bake something with no recipe which i've done before but i haven't done it in a while and i want to i like that because it's fun it's like fun because it could go wrong but it also could go right and if it goes right then it's like an accomplishment so i was like thinking about that and i was like maybe i'll bake something you know for dessert later and if it goes badly then so be it but if it goes well then it'll be fun you know the key is you can't go on your phone when you're bored because if you go on your phone when you're bored then you're entertained so you don't need to you're not bored anymore so then it doesn't force your brain to start coming up with ideas of how to entertain yourself okay that was way too much bronzer [ __ ] hey but wait it's fine because i'm doing this out of boredom not because i have to go somewhere so it doesn't really matter oh that was definitely too much doing my jawline again i put way too much why am i doing that today but hey it doesn't matter because i'm just doing this because i'm bored what kind of makeup look am i gonna do i've been seeing a lot of really pretty like green eyeshadow looks and i'm like thinking like that to be cute this is scary this is scary and risky green eyeshadow look can emma do it and i'm not using an inspo pic like i'm just gonna try it so we're gonna use this dirty brush why am i like nervous i'm gonna keep it simple and just do like green all over the lid okay that's not even showing up as green because this eyeshadow sucks either it sucks or i'm bad at makeup oh there we go i mean i guess so far so good like kind of want to make it almost messy i feel like that could look cool what if i add some like green shimmer on top i'd take a selfie with this actually it's kind of ugly but i don't care i don't care i'm just having fun it's light-hearted this is light-hearted and fun why does it look weird actually i don't know why i'm asking that as if like it's not obvious why it looks weird because i have no idea what i'm doing oh did not notice that that was happening maybe maybe when i add mascara it'll look good this is kind of tragic okay see i don't actually think the makeup look is that bad when i um let's not be so sure okay honestly it's kind of not looking that bad maybe this will actually look cool it smells like a food oh my god it smells like strawberry yogurt oh my god it smells like it smells like the yogurt you see it as a kid god i would i would eat that if i could here's my final makeup look i mean honestly it's not that bad did i do a good job i mean like for a rookie like for a makeup rookie how did i do it's like now what like now i'm just in a full face of makeup now what i'm hungry let's go downstairs and cook up something in a full face makeup because why not okay christmas outfit i bought these butternut squash crinkle cut butternut squash to be honest i just like the way that they're cut and i don't really like butternut squash but i'm trying to like try new foods and stuff so i was thinking i could kind of bake these and maybe turn them into like butternut squash fries i'm gonna use this as an excuse to use my air fryer and maybe it'll turn out good i'm not gonna follow a recipe because i'm coming up with this concept myself i'm gonna put these onto a bowl they're kind of wet first step we need to season these properly first we obviously have to do salt usually any kind of french fry has a lot of salt next we're adding garlic powder i'm gonna add a lot because i like garlic powder onion powder i'll add some paprika maybe some chili powder i don't use chili powder a lot but it smells really good this could be a fun new snack for me if i end up liking it okay i'm gonna put them in the air fryer tray they smell so garlicky i think i use too much garlic powder i don't think i can see anybody for the next few days i'm gonna spray these with some oil evenly coated popping these in the airfryer the funny thing about the airfryer is that like everybody's obsessed with the airfryer and yet like i have one in my toaster like it's a setting on my toaster oven but i don't ever use it because i just don't i'm like i'll just bake it like i don't get why air frying is so good okay you guys obviously want your dinner so let's feed you it's like you guys act like i've never fed you before they make a big mess with their food it's everywhere look how their food is just everywhere they eat so messy would you guys judge me if i postmated dinner like i never do this anymore but it's just not a cooking night for me okay fine i'll cook no i don't want to but i should but i don't want to while i think of what i'm gonna have for dinner i'm gonna eat yogurt okay oh my god you know what i could do what if i put a veggie burger in the airfryer next to this next to my butternut squash that's so efficient and easy i can't believe i didn't think of this earlier this is officially the laziest cooking i've ever done should i like pull something out now and see if it's i'm gonna burn myself i'm trying a little piece of a fry okay that's raw good tastes good though actually but it's raw see when it's done the butternut squash is not going as planned it's taking forever to cook but the veggie burger is done so let's taste let's see how the airfryer did it cooking it i put some pesto on it which sounds random but don't judge me i'm unique i'm a unique person and it's not homemade pesto either because guess what it's just not one of those nights okay so the air fryer did a great job with the veggie burger don't get me wrong this tastes great but i really think that you could have just done this in the oven do you think they're done now let's check you know what i think they're done again i'm gonna dip them in pesto i am unique they're pretty good i'll eat it but you won't see me walking around saying oh that's my favorite food the pesto is the only thing saving it though because in my humble opinion pesto's um just the best food on the planet maybe i do like it because i can't stop eating it that was relatively successful give this video a thumbs up if i need to take my makeup off right now when i'm by myself for too long like i start to lose it like you know what i'm saying like i've been alone for too long like my eye makeup is green i just put a veggie burger i guess putting a veggie burger in the air fryer isn't that random like that's so [ __ ] normal but i was i don't know like normally i would cook it in a pan but and but i'm going crazy and i put in the airfryer okay like what happens when you leave me alone i start going off the rails i mean i don't know bye it's the time we've all been waiting for the makeup's coming off okay i don't even think i got a good selfie in it either the thing about posting a selfie on instagram is that it's like there's something kind of embarrassing about it right not really like whenever i see somebody else's selfie i'm always like yes go off but when i post my own selfie i'm always a little bit embarrassed and i need to remember like nobody else like everybody else is probably looking at myself you being like go off queen i don't think anybody's like oh that's embarrassing it's possible i never look at somebody's selfie and think like girl what are you doing you know i don't i just have a hard time taking selfies like i just really do and i have a hard time posting them unless i'm being a little goofy in it unless i'm being goofy today was such a bizarre day for some reason like you know those days that just feel like they're a week long oh god it's literally 8 p.m but i'm going to bed i've been doing this recently i go to bed at like 9 30. i'm going to bed right now hi guys i'm in bed so let's recap the day wait i need to plug in my heating pad let's recap what we learned today number one boredom can be a good thing and we should embrace boredom in our day-to-day lives because it can inspire creativity and it can force you to self-reflect which is a good thing we didn't really talk about that earlier but it's true we learned to enjoy our relaxing days we learned that an air fryer is just a glorified oven it really is just an oven that's enough lessons for the day i think i'm gonna go to i'm literally going to bed it's like 8 30 but i'm just gonna read and go to bed i don't know i just want to you know like i'm full i'm happy i'm ready for bed like i don't want to do anything else but anyway i love you guys so much thank you for hanging out with me today i hope you had fun with me here's your forehead kiss as promised i love you guys i'm going to bed literally peace out here's another one here's another one okay whatever now i'm done okay i love you bye thank you again to google for sponsoring that portion of today's video

-emma chamberlain",2021-05-23T20:46:34Z,320908,9892063,8841,good morning good morning good morning everybody good morning guys good morning good morning everybody my hair is so dirty [Music] happy sunday when i'm filming this it's a sunday it's a foggy day out not hot but not cold it's like one of those days just to set the scene a little bit the reason why i love sundays is because it's it's this day of peace before the week starts and it's this day of relaxation before the week starts and that's why i like it i also like it because it's the day of farmer's markets i never use the farmer's market to its full potential like i feel like i never actually like go to the farmer's market and like get my groceries for the week because i never time it out properly right like sunday will roll around and i'll look in my fridge and i'm like i still have groceries like i don't need groceries right now so i don't want to buy more stuff because then stuff is going to go bad and i hate wasting food i don't know what it is but i've always been so weird about wasting food like i refuse which is a great um problem to have today um i looked in the fridge and i'm out like my fridge is like empty so i was like you know what that means let's go to the farmer's market so we're gonna go to the farmers market this morning i feel we need to go right now guys because it's 10 15. i'm getting a little later start to the day than normal all the moms start showing up at around 10 okay and they start making the line to the farmers market extremely long and i'm not somebody that enjoys lines although i don't think anybody enjoys waiting in line you know what else is going on today there's the flea markets flea markets are like places that have a bunch of vintage stores so maybe i'll go to one of those too declan you're so sweet you're so precious but you're gonna need to get off mommy let's go to the farmer's market i'm honestly embarrassed to admit that the farmer's market is maybe a 15-minute walk from me and yet i'm still driving now i have an excuse and my excuse is that i don't want to carry things home that's my excuse guys my allergies have been so bad the pollen in the air is severely affecting me my ears and nose are like itchy inside like i feel like it's itchy inside but you know whatever we deal with it you know what i've been thinking about recently when it comes to like my shopping addiction in a sense because i definitely love shopping a little bit too much sometimes i just want to be a minimalist with with clothes like sometimes i wish i just owned like 10 white tank tops 10 white t-shirts 10 pairs of jeans and that's it because those are my favorite things oh i just got a good parking spot maybe life isn't oh wait no i don't think i can park there no i think i can yay am i allowed to park here though [Music] we're done do you guys want a hall farmer's market haul first thing i got is a matcha okay the first thing i got is some skin care organic vegan skincare i got a body oil and i'm very excited for that i also got a body butter for when i get out of the shower and i'm very excited to try these i also got this little face oil to try out i also got a lip balm which we're gonna try right now hello let's try the lip balm um oh it's so nice and mild love this place is so cute and actually uh the girl and her mom who own this shop watch my youtube videos and i was so honored so i had to i had to just try everything so oh my god there's a hand sanitizer too wait love that and it smells good okay wait i'm gonna keep this in my car because it's so cute look at the packaging okay that was amazing so that was the first thing i got next i got broccoli there are literally so many people by my car right now and me holding up three cucumbers to the screen is just not very questionable like i can't imagine what they're thinking i also got a little strawberries so many raspberries can that guy not [ __ ] watch me like what you've never seen a youtuber before i like to eat my raspberries with my yogurt parfaits the fact that i went to the farmer's market and am now talking about yogurt parfaits is like further making me concerned that i'm turning into a mom should i try a strawberry looks gorgeous [Music] okay now what it's 11 in the morning i'm like what do i what's my next activity i might have to go to the flea market i know i really shouldn't go shopping but i've been so good like i've been so good that i feel like i've earned it i caved i just went and dropped off my groceries inside i caved and i decided i'm going to the flea market and i'm going and i'm you know what and i might buy clothes and i might but i might not and i'm going to try not to but i might that leads us to our sponsor of today's

emma link is in my description that's join honey.com emma anyway start saving today with with honey love you honey thank you for sponsoring today's video i love you guys anyway let's go to the flea market the problem is that it's like kind of far away and like that always makes me not want to go because i'm lazy but it's worth it like it's always worth it it's only 25 minutes i can handle that i'm not like that much of a baby i'm having kind of a fashion dilemma okay because part of me is like emma you want to be minimalist you want to literally just wear jeans and a white t-shirt every day and call it a day but then on the other hand i'm like i want to step up my style and have like a crazy unique style that nobody's ever seen before and i want to create something new but i don't really know if i have it in me right now i would say my fashion philosophy is very much like whatever i'm feeling in the moment it may not be extravagant it may not be groundbreaking and i'm more and i don't want i don't need it to be all the time like i feel like there's this pressure for everybody to like do groundbreaking things with their fashion sense and i'm like it just doesn't need to be that complicated if you dress to quote unquote fit in then you're boring but then if you dress kind of more eccentrically eccentrically then it's like some people are like you look [ __ ] stupid so it's like what are you supposed to do like there's i don't know that's why i'm like maybe i just need to do the whole white tank top in [ __ ] jeans thing and just wear that every day for the rest of my life and never have to think about clothes again you know so i think that the moral of the story is i'm just not gonna listen to what anybody else ever has to say and i'm just gonna have fun so that's kind of what's going on here also i did not just pick my nose i was itching it so don't get any sick and twisted ideas that i'm picking my nose i would never pick my nose um you know what fine i'll admit it i do pick my nose but i can say that i don't eat my boogers i can confidently say that i've never actually eaten my boogers like even when i was a kid it just always grossed me out i'm proud of that and i'm not saying i'm judging you if you if you eat your boogers i don't care it has no it's none of my [ __ ] business i really couldn't care less but i'm just saying for me that like i have never eaten my boogers not saying that it's wrong to eat them also not saying it's right though either i mean i guess it probably i i it can't be harmful i mean i doubt it's harmful probably relatively efficient actually if you think about it it's like you know a little afternoon snack pick-me-up for free costs zero money i want to do some research on the psychology of eating your boogers cause like in like not in a judgmental way like just genuinely like what's going on there like do they taste good like i i mean i've gotten a booger in my mouth on accident before like you know like when you're crying and your nose is running and it drips into your mouth anyway i'm gonna change the subject i literally wear this zip up sweater like every day i would wear it every day if i could i love it like i literally love it it's my it's one of my favorite things in my closet now is this extravagantly fashionable no but i [ __ ] love it okay like what i'm a simple gal you know what deep down i am a simple gal anyway every time i go to the flea market i have to pee which is like so annoying because there's no bathroom there but it's honestly not a bad thing because it means i won't spend too much time there but let's [ __ ] do this it's time to go hunting except for clothes not for animals i drove all the way to the flea market and it's not even open today is it even sunday it's sunday they're always open on sunday this has never happened i feel stupid and i just drove a half an hour it's still a half an hour for this this was a sign from the universe being like emma no more shopping for you no shopping for me today where's let me look this up online like is it closed today like i don't get it did they move locations like what's happening they're closed for mother's day because today's mother's day sorry i'm thinking i'm really thinking here i'm like do i go to another thrift store or not i'm home sorry i'm eating okay i'm so okay i'm not mad i'm not mad i'm just frustrated and now i don't know what to do with my day it's like i planned out my whole day around going to the flea market now it's cancelled what do i do i also realize i forgot to get more of my favorite hummus spicy hummus from the farmer's market which is making me very upset but i really don't know what to do with my sundae anymore i bought this squash i could try to make it it's crazy that they closed the flea market for mother's day it's like what if you wanted to go to the flea market with your mom i need to make a coffee this hair is going to be the death of me it pisses me off it doesn't fit in my clip and it just like sits out and just like causes a ruckus i haven't been making espresso as much i've been drinking more cold brew but i'm out of cold brew and i'm freaking out so we're gonna make an espresso instead chamberlain coffee espresso blend i'm gonna try to make an americano which is basically espresso and water add in water [Applause] so good wait so good but it's time to cook this is a spaghetti squash the thing about spaghetti squashes is that basically you roast them and then once you're done roasting them you basically fork out the center and it kind of turns into these like noodles that almost look like spaghetti first you have to cut it in half which is a literal like danger hazard because this thing is so [ __ ] probably shouldn't have done that okay so after you cut it open you're supposed to scoop out the center okay i really hope that this tastes good you're supposed to fork it ah perfect now we're gonna take our bestie here we're gonna spray it all right and now um i'm gonna throw this in the oven for like an hour but i also want to make chocolate strawberries i love chocolate strawberries but i just like it's never one of those things where i'm like oh i'm gonna make that you know what i'm saying like this is fun oh wait this is fun i kind of burnt the chocolate a little bit but maybe if i add some milk right like maybe that would like be good for it okay i think i need to microwave it again this is not a good consistency at all oh we know it's it's kind of working i think it needs i don't know what does it need why is the chocolate like hard i literally think i burnt it but i'm gonna make it work because i don't want again i don't like to waste cute it doesn't look very pretty but like it's not all about appearance with this stuff guys this is kind of catastrophic if i'm being honest it really is not why why [ __ ] it i made four i'll just eat the rest now it's definitely not my best work time to put our squash in the oven anyway that was delicious so that's like fun and easy snack wow why have i not been doing that our squash is done check this out watch this magic so you flip over your squash and then you go like this and it makes this like pasta almost it looks good look guys i'm glad that i made my squash today because imagine if this would have gone to waste and what a shame that would have been putting this in a tupperware like the mom that i am now i'm gonna add some tomato sauce should probably salt it a little bit and then we can add some tomatoes see this is fun is it gross like i can't tell if it's gross should we give it a try oh no severely undersalted watch me over salt it now too knowing my look needs more seasoning adding a bunch of chili flakes that's good okay great now i have spaghetti squash for the next few days that was productive but now what oh and i have four lumpy chocolate strawberries i'm in bed let me tell you about my newest skincare craze so i got this it's like a red light a red and blue light mask okay it's supposed to like kill bacteria on your face i didn't buy this i would never buy this because this is it's 500 this was actually a gift from youtube so shout out to youtube i've been using it every day and i think it's actually working i don't know but literally look at how absolutely over the top this is so i do this for about three minutes per day i'm also reading i'm reading two books right now the grapes of wrath not my favorite book i've ever read but definitely it's it's okay so far and i'm also reading 1984 1984 by oh already done that was not three minutes anyway um i'm reading 1984 by george orwell why is this dying oh i probably need to charge it i haven't charged it in a long time but anyway i'm gonna read i'll see you guys when i'm done reading and we'll see what happens um i feel really tired i think i'm dehydrated i realized i hadn't had any liquid except for caffeine because i just like am not responsible so i went downstairs i had a snack i um poured myself a sparkling water or not sparkling water a flake of fruit fruity flavored water but i think i just drank too much caffeine and not enough water so we're drinking this now i also only read my book for like five seconds and then i went on tick tock like i'm i i'm not doing so well with my um internet my internet balance uh which has not been good for me i've been um going on my phone more than i want would like to oh okay we're not gonna take my blankie thank you okay we're not gonna take my blankie okay we're not gonna take it how are you guys not sick of my videos yet i do the same [ __ ] every day i cook i go on walks i read i that's it like i how are you guys not bored of me yet it really blows my mind i'm very grateful you know the seven wonders of the world well there's an eighth wonder of the world for me and it's how you guys are not bored of me yet let's give me another hour and see if i'm out of bed okay just give me a [ __ ] hour guess what we're just not going to talk about yesterday we are not going to talk about the second half of yesterday okay we are not going to discuss it it didn't happen it is a new day and good morning i don't know what happened um although i think something's in the air because like both of my parents have been feeling really tired and all my friends have been feeling really tired all of my two friends chamberlainpoppy.com this is actually so good i really like it's hard for me to choose my favorite so i'm just not going to choose my favorite but it's very good this is very good to make up for my lack of activities yesterday um i thought this morning i could show you my productive morning routine okay so here's what my um productive morning routine includes i start out by making some sort of caffeinated drink of course next i get ready for the gym i know this is shocking let me explain i have a gym membership i just never use it and i never used it because i was like emma you don't like the gym the other day i was thinking about it and i was like okay i used to go to a gym when i was a teenager i still have a teenager when i was like in high school i used to go to the gym all the time and i actually loved it like for absolutely no [ __ ] reason like god knows why i loved it and so i was like you know what i'm gonna start going to the gym again i'm gonna try it out i'm gonna have this gym membership for the next few months why don't i try to go to the gym my morning routine recently has been very very la it involves waking up drinking coffee or matcha getting ready to go to the gym going to the gym and going straight to an overpriced coffee shop for a matcha then after that i go straight to an overpriced grocery store called erwan and i get my favorite salad then i come home and i cook for myself the only part of that that's not super la is the last part where i come home and i cook for myself everything else though that is so la then i was thinking about it more and i was like okay i asked myself does that stuff make me happy unfortunately the answer is yes and maybe i enjoy it out of a little bit of irony or maybe i'm just a little maybe i'm more simple than i thought and maybe i'm just turning into a [ __ ] la [ __ ] and guess what there's nothing against l.a [ __ ] honestly also i know very many la [ __ ] that are actually really great people anyway enough of my existential crisis i am having one though can i tell you too i was genuinely like nervous to vlog my new morning routine i was like oh my god they're gonna give me so much [ __ ] they are gonna give me so much [ __ ] because they're gonna [ __ ] say that i'm an la basic [ __ ] and gina what i'm here to say i love you guys and you guys can say that if you want because i i deserve it but also just know that at the end of the day i'm still the same me baby i'm so saving me [Music] okay my pants even say l.a on it like what is what am i turning into you know what always separates me though from the la culture like you want to know what really like keeps me in line and like make sure that i i never become an la girl is the fact that i don't wash my hair i've showered my body okay but this is what my hair it's my ugly hairstyle for the gym here's the funny thing about this morning routine everything in my life could be going wrong but yet when i do this morning routine and for the you know two or so hours that i participate in this morning routine everything disappears all my responsibilities and i just get to exist i actually think i'm gonna get a match on the way instead of um getting one on the way back today i think i'm going to get one on the way today and maybe i'll get one after two but i don't think i'm i don't think so you know what's actually cute is that i've been wearing this same white long sleeve workout shirt to the gym since i was literally 15. i'm 20 now i'm about to be 20. actually i think when you're watching this i'm 20. can you believe that guys i'm 20. feel old yet i think what's comforting is that my dad is like 55 and he surfs every day and is like the happiest person i know and he's 55. you know what i'm saying and he's like having a lot more fun than i am and i'm 20. okay which is promising it's like okay wait you know what things actually can get better when any of you are feeling scared or worried about growing up just think of my dad 55 and literally thriving more than he ever has okay great so there's construction on the street of my matcha shop my overpriced matcha shop and that means that there's no parking so i'm going to park in an illegal spot and risk getting my car towed i'll be back time to go to the gym i think i already wore this shirt it smells a little bit wrong waking up in the wait i don't know if i can sing that or else i'll get why are you copyrighted for that i'm in the garage of the gym [ __ ] oh i can't sing i swear to god i can't tell if i like have just worn this for too many years and it just has like a permanent sweat smell or if i already wore it and i forgot to wash it let's go to the [Music] gym jim sesh done my workout was very nice i did a little walking on the treadmill with the incline you know the whole like viral tick-tock treadmill workout that's like walking on the treadmill for 30 minutes at a 12 incline i've been doing that i actually really like it i get all my ideas from tiktok now i'm on my way to erwan to get a little snacky something happened to me at the gym i um go to put in my air pods and they make a weird sound in my ear and then i realized that they were dead heartbreaking moment i basically just worked out for an hour listening to people grunting i think my new strategy is that i'm going to get matcha before i work out drink like half of it and then after i'm done working out i still have half of a matcha in the car it's very efficient can they can okay sorry i was about to literally be a [ __ ] mom and be like why are the roads in l.a so bumpy can they fix it los angeles needs to get their [ __ ] together and fix it i literally almost said something like that along those lines but i stopped myself i literally i i honestly think that i just like going to erwin for the environment like i just like the environment although i would say most people in la would say the same like there's something about erwan that's just like comforting it's like comforting and safe and maybe i'll get like another matcha or something because i heard that they have matcha and i've never tried it so whatever we'll see [Music] yay why is it so good thank you guys for hanging out with me today and yesterday i had a lot of fun even though i felt like [ __ ] i'm gonna go exist for the rest of the day as one does and i'm gonna say goodbye to you here and i'm gonna give you your forehead kiss and i love you so much and i hope that you have an amazing rest of your week and i'll see you next week i love you from your favorite la girl emma bye [Music]

-emma chamberlain",2021-05-16T20:26:02Z,315732,4506636,7922,good morning hey good morning good morning [Music] hi i literally have not played drums since the last time i filmed i don't know i'll let you know when i learn more but for now we're just going to get the same three or four drum beats over and over again good morning beautiful boy oh good morning good morning today we're vlogging nothing new nothing crazy but we're vlogging a work day and you're probably like emma what does that even mean like whenever youtubers are like i have to work it's always like okay what does that mean for you everybody's confused so i'm trying to show you what that looks like today show you what my life looks like when i'm not just laying in bed reading and complaining about things it's eight in the morning the first thing i have to do is make coffee actually no the first thing i have to do is feed the cats because they're literally whining at me and getting angry ew i just spilled cat food juice all over my counter but they're eating it so first step is making coffee of course i've been trying to drink um matcha and coffee throughout the day because if i drink too much coffee in a day i think it hurts my ibs so i'm trying to split it half and half with matcha like matcha half the day coffee at the day whatever i mean listen i'm still figuring it out chamberlaincoffee.com we've got some cold brew sweet cream nut pods it needs more but i'm out of that flavor so i'm gonna need to figure out okay we'll mix the sweet cream flavor with some vanilla and see how that goes it's pretty [ __ ] good let's sit outside and chat i've been recently really liking sitting outside with my coffee in my mornings in the mornings if it like works out like if like like if it's not too cold and stuff you know kind of [ __ ] foggy as hell today good morning what's on the agenda for the day i have a call at 10 30 and then i have to get ready for a shoot i'm doing a pretty quick shoot today it's a video shoot for a brand that i love working with i'm not sure if i'm allowed to say what brand it is it's for levi's it's for levi's i okay i'm gonna say it i if they get mad at me levi i'm sorry i love you i just want to talk about you all the time so i'm doing a little video shoot for levi's very short literally two hours that's about it i mean like okay so the thing is it's so funny to me it's like when youtubers or influencers in general like talk about quote-unquote work i feel like it's just bad vibes there's something about like a youtuber talking about work that's just like it just seems out of touch i i can't put a finger on it i recently have been having a lot of stomach problems ibs related if you don't know what ibs is it's irritable bowel syndrome basically means your stomach's just super sensitive specifically i'm not supposed to drink coffee on an empty stomach like that's not a good sign but i'm so impatient in the morning that i keep doing it and i keep forgetting i'm in this like swing of things in my life now where it's like i wake up i make my coffee and i go and do a few my morning routine stuff then i make breakfast later like it's just my schedule but i'm [ __ ] at my stomach in the process it's no it's no good let me tell you the truth about having stomach issues okay because i've been dealing with this a lot lately and i feel like i haven't talked about it because i just nobody [ __ ] wants to hear about my stomach problem but listen to this okay the number of foods that i that that don't bother my stomach there's not a lot and if i eat something that like hurts my stomach like i will be literally burping farting and like doubled over in pain it's not good okay so there was one food that i didn't realize was hurting my stomach for like six months i was going to this restaurant grocery store every single day and getting this cauliflower dish it was a buffalo cauliflower dish and it was my favorite food and every day i was like in social settings like clenching my ass cheeks i know it's disgusting okay whatever like shut the [ __ ] up you fart too [ __ ] i've never been so sad about something because i was like okay i could like i could in theory continue eating this cauliflower dish every day like i was and just have this excruciating crippling gas or i could just stop eating it and find something else to enjoy but like seriously talk about a heartbreaking moment but i did see a tick tock once it was like girls who have stomach issues are hot too so i double tapped that tick tock and i felt i felt understood you guys don't understand how bad this gas was i can't okay i'm really tming now like i've been filming for 20 minutes like i need to move on this morning for breakfast i just farted didn't hear it see what's making me fart today although that was like a harmless fart there's a difference between harmless fart and like painful fart where you're like doubled over in pain like this there's a difference that was a harmless fart like that's not gonna that didn't hurt me and that's not gonna hurt anybody else what's for breakfast this morning you know those things called like egg bites they're like little muffins that look like they're like made out of eggs i kept seeing those on menus like i was seeing them at menus at different like fast food places and stuff like that so i figured out how to make them myself okay it took me a few tries but i got a pretty good recipe down i basically make them ahead of time and then i just warm them up in the [ __ ] toaster oven and it's easy oh my god what was that there they go and then what i eat them with spicy hummus from the farmer's market [ __ ] and y'all if you have a trader joe's near you this vegan chickenless seasoning salt brb let me be an influencer real quick this vegan chickenless seasoning salt [ __ ] great my cute little egg muffins it's my cute little egg muffins literally give this video the fattest thumbs up if you want the recipe they're fire actually are they really that good i think they're just convenient i don't actually know i mean no they're good like they're good but no they're good you guys can give them a try and let me know when i show you the recipe if you give this video a thumbs up you guys better get this video to literally like so much thumbs up or else i'm not showing you the recipe i'm not oh my god my jaw just cracked if you guys don't give this video the most thumbs up out of every video on youtube i'm not gonna show you the recipe i'm not sorry you guys better give it a smash that thumbs up right now you guys seriously better because if you don't you're not getting the recipe um get some hummus on the fork honestly it's so good hummus is my favorite food it's technically like a condiment i guess kind of right okay now what i always feel gross when i lick off my fingers but i'm like is that really gross i'm by myself but nobody said i had manners like nobody said i had good manners nobody has ever said that i don't have terrible manners like i say please and thank you and i'm i put my napkin on my lap when i'm at a restaurant when i remember my parents were just so relaxed with me that they weren't like you know forcing me to have these like you know super technical good manners but then again i don't think i bad i don't think i have bad manners necessarily but i don't have like perfect manners you know see but that burp is not my fault this is what happens every time i eat like i just start burping and farting and crying okay i just had to think about what i was going to do until my call started i think i'm going to read i am now reading the grapes of wrath this is my third book that i've read since the beginning of my reading journey and so time for my call hashtag business i'm waiting for them to call me oh guys hang up on them hi time to get dressed i look i always get comments of people being like emma can you cut the burps out of the video you gotta either accept all of me or take me to the curb because i am who i am baby anyway let me change i'm changing once i get there but this is just good enough for now i need to pack a little bag of my things maybe this one here's a haul of everything i'm bringing to my shoot we have my car key camera battery oh my phone it's really all i need it's pretty low maintenance out here i brush my teeth off camera i promise not that it matters because you wear a mask the whole like mask thing has been really bad for my dental hygiene because i don't prioritize brushing my teeth as much as i used to like don't get me wrong i brushed twice a day but like i used to brush the second i wake up now i brush my teeth at like noon and sometimes i don't even do it at all if i'm by myself and i forget listen i'm just being honest with you guys we're gonna go get a matcha before we go i like to leave like 15 minutes early so that i can show up and like have something in hand bye kitty cat see you later love you [ __ ] it's hot so we're gonna go grab a matcha why is it not loading on our way i really hope i i think i brush my teeth terrible there's something nice about carrying around a drink what can i say what can i say like sometimes i'll go and walk and get matcha like three times in a day just because i like want something to do if we're being honest it's not a cheap activity like matcha's in coffee like they they add up it's an expensive hobby but i do enjoy it let's see if it's ready it's ready brb got it okay so it's 11 30 and i don't have to be there till noon and it will take me five minutes to get there so i'm like what do i do i don't like being early because i just don't like i'd rather spend time like by myself instead of like being early somewhere so i might just sit here for a sec okay why is this girl staring at me like as if she isn't walking around in west hollywood california where all the vloggers exist like some girl just like gave me the dirtiest look for having a camera and talking to it and i'm like we're in la okay like most people are filming every move that they make it's not it shouldn't be that shocking anymore ah should i do a what's in my uh center console of my car haul yes i'm gonna do that you don't know what the center console is it's like the thing in between the two seats reusable spoon reusable spoon hand sanitizer are you having fun yet hi sir love you copious amounts of hot sauce a hair tie orange tic tacs the best flavor of tic-tacs love tampon lip balm some soy sauce in a rubber band no way remember wait i actually [ __ ] with this wait this is actually kind of fun let's bring these back oh my god i have a coachella guys your center console in your car will tell a lot about you as a person literally an artifact scissors that's it that was my center console haul i've killed enough time i hope you guys enjoyed my uh my center console haul like really i really hope you enjoyed it like i know you i know you guys probably did because there's like some seriously riveting stuff in there but i'll see you guys when i get to the shoot i'm i'm gonna go over there now so yeah i'm getting my makeup and hair and nails done i feel like a princess today god bless you all oh god i thought my phone was gonna fall off my lap bye i'm ready um i can't show anything else which is like oh emma best vlogger ever showing everything she's doing yeah right i don't show everything that i do so sorry about that i'm not showing everything i'm doing so sorry about that oh my god look at my hair though i'm gonna keep these extensions in for as long as i possibly can because i want to feel like i have long hair again see ya i'm done time to go get lunch [Music] we're gonna go to my favorite grocery store erwin i can't believe i've never filmed me at air one it's like the la grocery store i've never filmed it before so we're gonna go together hi finish the shoot it was really fun it was really short i got a mani at the chute but now i need to go eat because i am very hungry so let me explain erwan to you basically air one is like a grocery store that's just like extreme it's hard to explain i will show you so that you can kind of understand but in la erwan is like the place to go because there's great food it's extremely overpriced people love it i have a lot of adrenaline right now because sometimes when i do shoots i like leave and i just like feel like i feel crazy because i just like you know did something that was kind of nerve-wracking and then all of a sudden i'm like talking a million miles an hour and super [ __ ] annoying so i kind of feel like i'm being like that right now i haven't had long hair like this in forever it's kind of giving me an attitude i'm serious i can't make this stuff up like for the rest of the day i'm about to be a raging [ __ ] i'm also hangry like i am hungry one of my favorite times of the day is when i come to air juan and get some food and watch youtube videos in my car it's like i can't explain it but there's something like romantic about it although the other day when i was sitting in my car eating my air wand somebody came up to my car window and started knocking on the window i'm not lying um and i don't want to be mean but i didn't ask what they wanted or give them the time of day and i immediately drove away and it kind of killed my vibe while i was in erwin i saw my old beloved the vegan buffalo cauliflower it hurts me every time i see it like i miss it so much it literally felt like a breakup when i realized that it was causing me stomach problems i'm not kidding like i was equally as devastated instead of like getting a full meal at erwan i know that i have a lot of groceries at home so i'm forcing myself to complete my meal with food that i already have in my fridge i am my own mother like i am my own mother i literally discipline myself i'm like emma no you have food at home like what the [ __ ] kind of grandma [ __ ] i swear to god me being my own mom is kind of honestly handy because it's like if if i wasn't my own mom nothing would get done like really like i have to yell at myself and be like emma it's time to do your [ __ ] chores you stupid little stubborn [ __ ] we're home so we're making a little yogurt vegan yogurt this is my favorite one god i'm such an influencer today i feel like you're just keeping like this is my favorite one like emma shut the [ __ ] up i used to never wash my fruit but recently i've been washing it and then putting it back into the container because the other day i found a dried-up roly-poly bug in one of my raspberries i've been forever scarred this is the best granola i love it very delicious okay listen i just got invited to dinner so here's my plan um i have to be ready in 30 minutes the extensions are out i took off all my makeup except for my eye makeup and i'm going to attempt to touch up the rest of my face makeup so let's see what we can accomplish here like i'm really gonna try to make something out of nothing here okay i actually feel like this could work my skin's kind of red and irritated from wearing makeup all day which happens to me sometimes not to mention i have like no time like if this doesn't work i'm kind of screwed fun fact if you put your foundation on the back of your hand you can rub the excess on your neck fun fact i think i've said that like every time i've ever done a makeup tutorial but anyway so far so good could totally go downhill from here though this is where i feel like things can go downhill okay that actually worked out maybe let's find out can i do it again on the other side okay honestly not bad things are working um it looks really bad in the camera that's embarrassing um okay we might be [ __ ] things up a little bit not to mention i'm like exhausted so not sure how going to dinner is gonna go for me it's it's throwing me off because my lips are not done but i feel like we're getting there i feel like we're getting somewhere maybe it's possible i'm running out of time as well i need to be ready in 20 minutes okay i need to do my lips right now because they look [ __ ] terrible must over line sorry i'm being conceited sorry you guys had to see that i was like in the mirror okay but y'all admit that you do that too so honestly i salvaged that wow guys okay the lighting's [ __ ] weird hold on i mean honestly i'm literally using my [ __ ] phone my eyes are like still done okay i'm happy with it does it look good i literally don't care time to pick out an outfit now this is when things are gonna get messy here's the first thing i don't like carrying a purse so i need to wear pants that have pockets so that's first step i'm kind of leaning towards jeans honestly like i'm just feeling like it's a jean night for me and i i feel like there's nothing wrong with that i'm making a mess check one of these will do but now i need to dress it up on the top half because i'm wearing jeans so it's like i have to like kind of classy it up this is where i start to freak out this is where i start to completely lose it wait what's the weather like why is my flashlight on i feel like you know when like moms are like walking around with their phones like this and they're like get in the car it's time for school and you're like mom your [ __ ] flashlight is on [ __ ] okay it's 60 degrees so that's kind of cold but i'm like weirdly determined to wear this top because i feel like it'd be cute okay i feel like that's a good start to the outfit so let's try it on okay i'm ready i have my lipsticks and i'm putting them in my pocky i actually have 10 minutes to spare too can you believe it i have 10 god my makeup does not look bad listen don't doubt yourself guys like you would be surprised what you're capable of um anyway god what a day like actually a lot happened to me today like i actually did things can you believe it i can't personally because i'm so used to doing absolutely nothing every single day so like this was kind of a hectic day and now i'm like gonna go be social so that's pretty crazy um i really loved hanging out with you guys today and i hope you had fun hanging out with me and i love you all very much and you guys are my besties and that's that's for real and here's your forehead kiss i hope you're having an amazing week if you're not i get it and i've been there we get through it we're tough as humans we're tough look at me being inspirational but it's [ __ ] true so whatever i love you guys very much here's another forehead kiss honestly i can't just give you one it's just like not enough have a beautiful rest of your week and i'm gonna go to dinner okay i love you guys i'm going now bye i actually have to go now see now i'm gonna be [ __ ] late [Music] you

-emma chamberlain",2021-05-10T20:05:16Z,225225,4745780,6603,i bet you're thinking emma this is not your kitchen where in the world could you be well it all started when i was born [Music] i had this crazy idea yesterday where i was like i am going to go on a last minute trip i need it i need a little recharge so i'm just gonna go to the desert for 48 hours so i rented an airbnb and this morning i drove here i'm in the desert and i set some rules for myself i was like okay rule number one no social media rule number two only source of entertainment is allowed to be books number three that's it i'm gonna make some tea so give me a second while i fill the kettle okay i think i did that right i literally packed a cooler look filled it with groceries and i just [ __ ] drove my ass here okay now this was very spontaneous and to be honest not super well thought out i don't think i really thought about how frightening the desert may be at night [Music] so when i got here i immediately got into bed and started reading and that was great and that lasted for about an hour then i got hungry so i cooked in the kitchen that was fun whatever and then i laid in bed and literally stared at the ceiling i know that's kind of sad but yes i did that that was good and then i was like okay i'm actually getting really bored so i cooked dinner and then it started to get dark out and i was like i don't like this anymore i don't like this anymore at all to give you some context i am in the middle of it of the desert in a house by myself that has minimal security i have no weapons the closest thing i have to a weapon is this hydra flask which is honestly a relatively good weapon but like not a lot and immediately as a very anxious person i started to well freak out and i wanted to go home but i was like you know what no emma we're gonna stick it through is that even a saying we're gonna stick it through and we're gonna have a good day tomorrow originally i was going to sleep here tomorrow night too i decided canceled i'm only going to make myself sleep here one night as a challenge for self development character growth etc etc but anyway should i give you a tour here is the front door having serious digestive issues so the place is really cute if you want to know why i picked this place out of all the other airbnbs i saw pink fridge it kind of feels like i'm camping because i had to like bring all my own food and stuff to cook which was fun i liked that element i loved packing for this trip it was like fun to fill up the cooler with all the food in my fridge i also brought other stuff like salt of course oh speaking of that i should make cold brew for tomorrow morning guys i'm so smart the quietness of the desert is almost terrifying like i almost hate it okay i didn't bring mason jars because i'm not very smart so we're gonna do something a little bit creative the thing about traveling alone is i think that you need to make sure that you know what you're gonna do with your day because i didn't really think about like okay emma what are you gonna do every day and i didn't plan that out whereas like my last solo trip i went to new york i had there's so much to do but in the desert there's a lot less to do praying that this is cold brew in the morning time will tell there's not much to do here although the town um closest to me in the place that i'm staying has many thrift stores and although i'm trying not to shop would it hurt i'm not gonna lie guys i'm freaked out i'm trying to talk over the fact that i'm genuinely frightened for my safety i know it'll be fine but as most people's brain works it's like well i guess not most people can the lights not flicker at all during this trip please yes i brought lemon juice from home in a mason jar i'm turning into a mom seriously more and more every day i brought my have you seen i am a mom as i started to brush my teeth my brain started coming up with a new creepy scenario what if one of the neighbors is a creep and knows that this house gets rented out and they've been waiting for the perfect victim none of the people that have come by and stayed at this airbnb have been the perfect victim which is why nobody knows that this guy is plotting to kill somebody well he's gonna see me and say she's perfect because she's a vulnerable small girl by herself and then kill me i just want something to relax me i feel like doing this little gouache massage could really help maybe i just learned how to do this i think i was just using it upside down i don't know are you enjoying watching this this really does feel really good i can't lie it is currently 9 30. am i scared a little bit but i've tried to calm some of my anxiety by reading i feel much better listen i only have one night here i'm not gonna lie you know it's like moments like this when i'm like emma you [ __ ] idiot why did you do this so last minute why didn't you just stay home but i have to make the most of it because i'm here my stomach hurts but literally what's new wanna see how much left i have of my book i farted um i have this much left of my book not much you guys all right i'll see you tomorrow if anything spooky happens throughout the night i'll let you know but i'm really hoping that the next clip you see of me is me in the morning bright-eyed and bushy-tailed ready for the day also it looks like i was itching my boob but i swear to god i was itching the eczema in my armpit i can promise you that peace and love hopefully i see you tomorrow i like don't want to say goodbye to you guys because you guys are making me feel safe right now like i feel like i'm not alone and then when i turn this off i'm alone again okay good night love you good morning i did it guys it really wasn't that bad when i tell you i fell asleep in like 30 seconds i did so i don't know what i was going on about but i'm exhausted because story time hold on there was some drama last night at around four in the morning i wake up and i have excruciating stomach pain so bad like worse than period cramps like so bad i'm sweating my full body's covered in sweat i try to take vitamins and stuff to help with my digestion because i have stomach problems well i just tried a new one let's just say i sat on the toilet for a while we're gonna have a fun day today although it is literally 40 degrees outside it's like colder than when i was in new york i thought the desert was you know gonna be hotter let's see how my cold brew turned out worked out pretty good i think i should get bundled up and go for a walk but it's gonna take some courage oh i didn't mean to turn the camera i'm not gonna lie to you i'm stalling going outside because it's so cold and if we're being honest i did not pack properly like can i show you one of the things i packed this cute vintage short top whatever i was trying to be here in the desert dressed in style coachella vibes well clearly um i just didn't plan properly because it's 40 degrees so i may brave the cold and try to get an instagram photo in this outside with timer cam because i have no friends until it warms up a little bit outside i'm gonna do indoor activities okay which i know like defeats the purpose but this is still kind of heavenly sitting in this gorgeous leather chair with my gorgeous cold brew in my leggings [Music] now i feel like i have an old person body like i feel like my body just aged really badly and it's just like i'm already starting to like lock up could also be because i had a very restless night of sleep filled with diarrhea and feelings of severe pain if i'm being honest i thought i had appendicitis you know what appendicitis is when your appendix is pendus when your appendix explodes my brain was starting to go there sorry tmi okay i now realize that this whole stretching thing was a waste of time it was a cute idea though right a for effort but no what i can do is i can go on a walk so maybe i'll do that instead in order to stall more so that i don't have to go outside i'm making breakfast i'm going to attempt to make an omelette so we'll see how that goes i've never made an omelette it can't be that hard wow i didn't bring like much seasoning thank god i have salt but like that's pretty much all i have we're gonna have to make that work watch this magic yup it's really [ __ ] loud i don't know if that's a good thing okay what see if i can do it with one hand as oh no like that went bad like that went real bad see oh my god i got shell in that one too [ __ ] raw eggs whatever if i get a little shell it won't kill me oh wait i found black pepper this was here i always get kind of grossed out using like oh that was way too much pepper are you [ __ ] with me looks like [ __ ] lemon poppy seed salad dressing i wonder where the shell went i mean it looks kind of pretty right oh i need to make another coffee wow that was the perfect amount of cold brew you know what some things are going right on this trip although i am going to click bait this video and say trip to the desert alone went wrong oh great yeah the omelet also went wrong oh i've never made an omelette but it can't be that hard i can't oh my god that's the worst looking i swear i'm not that bad of a cook like i swear it's just that like i swear okay honestly it doesn't look that bad really sriracha sriracha really has a crazy smell huh i have some spicy hummus i'm gonna add that to the top as a dollop we're kind of working with what we have here because i don't have like my full kitchen to be great to be very creative and such it might be good i shockingly don't hate it it's definitely a little weird this is the final meal in my desert home and i feel like i did a decent enough job and if any of you know me you know that i like burnt eggs so the fact that the eggs are burnt does not bother me well i mean i finished the whole thing it couldn't have been that bad i wonder where the shell went there was like three shells in my eggs i'll let you guys know how that turns out when they come out the other end we did it i got out of the house and i'm on a walk it's freezing unfortunately this trip has been difficult for me which is kind of a bummer considering my last solo trip was like an amazing experience this is my second solo trip and it didn't go so well and i'm discouraged but i'm also like emma it's good for you to fail sometimes and to feel a little stupid and feel like you didn't plan properly it's good it is nice to walk here though fit check ugliest fit check ever also just ignore my hair like i can't can't really explain what's going on there this is giving me very much seventh grade side bangs remember in like at least when i was in middle school everybody wanted side bangs like this so everybody like tried to cut them themselves and it just went terribly bad miss those days simpler times simpler to out [ __ ] i hope you enjoyed that unnecessarily long desert clip chances are you can't even hear me right now because it's so windy all right i'm gonna i'm gonna keep walking i'm out of this [ __ ] i decided i would pack up the car and i would adventure around the town a little bit and then just go immediately home because that's i vibe checked myself i was like vibe check and i my response to myself was you want to go home so bad um i found a coffee shop that's pretty close by so that's my first destination apparently this coffee shop is in a van so this is exciting we got it i feel nervous filming people around here because i feel like i'm so in the middle of the desert that they would not understand a youtuber oh my god it's actually really good okay but also look how crazy i am i went into my cooler in the back and got my nut pod i'm taking advantage of the fact that this is going to be the only time in my life that i actually have nut pods in my car i mean i'm happy so here's my plan for the remainder of the day i'm gonna start driving home but i know for a fact that on the way home i'm going to see a lot of fun little thrift stores and stuff like that i looked a lot of them up online and it seems like a lot of them are actually closed which is there's okay there's not it's not all dirt roads based on all of my um context clues that i've absorbed i can't imagine that they're updating their yelp page or their google page it can be hard sometimes when you know that you're being negative you know what i'm saying like you know in your brain you're like i know i'm being negative about said situation and i know that i need to change my mindset i know that but sometimes you can know that and it's like impossible to turn it off the first good thing that's happened is this coffee it's actually very good oh my god there's another coffee shop that one's so cute it's too soon though i thought that i was just gonna read and journal and meditate and do yoga [ __ ] no like it just wasn't what i was in the mood for and then i was mad at myself because i was like emma you're supposed to be on your philosophical educational life altering eye-opening journey of your late teens early 20s that's what you're supposed to be doing right now and you just took yourself to joshua tree to do that and now you're doing none of it and you're scared and you're in a bad mood you are a failure no i'm not also i totally caved and went on my phone last night i read my book listen i read my book but i also went on my phone i also went on my phone a little bit today but it's good to fail every once in a while it's humbling i was starting to think too highly of myself because of all the books i've been reading and all of the time i've been spending alone i started to think that i was like i just thought i was like a genius i was like oh my god i'm turning into a [ __ ] genius i am literally turning into a an intellectual because i'm spending so much time alone in reading so much [ __ ] book i can't believe i woke up at 4 a.m to have diarrhea like that's just never happened that's just never happened to me and like of course on this trip i wake up with the worst stomach pain i've ever had and explosive sorry i honestly i know you guys watch my videos some of you guys watch my videos while you're eating and i know you're probably like emma stop i won't talk about my diarrhea anymore but i would be lying if it wasn't still going on it's not over i just pulled over because i saw a thrift store and it was open i'm just hoping that they take credit card wish me luck [Music] [Applause] y'all it was a success let's do a thrift haul the first thing i got everything was so cheap it was like actually thrift prices because in la they jack up the prices of everything at thrift stores because they know that they can i got this cute little random bag i don't know what vibe this gives me but i just liked it and i like the colors on it i love this little detail here it was like 15 bucks and it's actually really nice quality next thing i got i had to get like i just couldn't help myself like come on and honestly it's like the material so soft i just feel like i'm gonna wear this more than i should i got this leather vest i couldn't help myself again look how cute it is it says lady ryder which i think is so cute born wild still wild this said deal with it girls ride two it ain't easy to be me high maintenance i want to wear this over a hoodie and just call it a day i love leather vests this one's just like funny and cute the last thing i got is so boring literally ten belts but listen belts are so expensive this place had so many belts and all of them were one dollar so i went crazy i got all different types i got like this here pink one i just thought was super cute two more gold ones this brown one and then this black and silver one so that was fun i feel satisfied i feel like i thrifted enough where like i'm not going to be sad if i just go straight home now i feel like i got some little things to remember my trip by so that doesn't make me as sad do i even want to remember this trip though back on the road we'll see if i stop somewhere else um and if something piques my interest nothing else piqued my interest on the way out of the town i was more just absorbing the sights and honestly i think i enjoy the drive of road trips sometimes even more than the trip itself i think i'm getting my period because i'm having very bad cramps but it also could be from my digestion supplement that kept me up all night i'm not going to go into detail about that again i think i've already done it three too many times oh my god shout out to the truck next to me for getting dust all over my windshield i didn't appreciate it but it also wasn't their fault i guess i'm about to drive through coachella valley fond memories honestly it's crazy to me that coachella didn't happen for two it's not gonna happen this year and it didn't happen last year that's two years of no coachella and i'm like i'm here to tell the tale like it didn't kill me i have a strategy for coachella next time we get to attend i think i'm not gonna put any effort into my outfits i used to put so much effort into my outfits i would spend months planning my outfits for coachella i would make a literal spreadsheet presentation but i think i'm going to do the complete opposite next time i get to go and i'm going to put zero effort into my outfits almost as a statement i've changed i've grown up my priorities have shifted and i no longer care about being fashionable at coachella but then lord knows coachella's going to come around and i'm going to have a 20-page presentation for planning my outfits like it'd be like a rev it's like reverse psychology because it's like okay wait actually she looks the coolest because she didn't try at all sorry if you can hear the rain maybe it's calming maybe it's relaxing i don't know maybe you enjoy it it's just a little loud which is bothering me personally anyway ttyl i'm home honestly i don't think i've ever been this happy to be in my bed like i don't know why i'm just so happy to be home that's rare i don't say that often you know i think that traveling can serve two purposes number one it can give you a slice of where you wish you lived like you go somewhere and you're like uh i wish i could live here blah blah blah i never want to leave and you go home and you're a little bit bummed out but you're left with this fantasy oh next time i go like i can't wait for that i can't wait for the next time i get to go and you're also left with the fantasy of maybe one day i'll move there that's like what new york is for me and then you have a trip that may be fun and maybe cool but you're ready to leave when it's time to leave like you're excited to leave and you're excited to go home and you're excited to be in your own bed my trip was the second option i am home and happy to be here with my kitty declan do you want to come say hi to your friends okay declan is in a meeting right now it's 9 p.m declan only takes meetings from noon to 5 p.m so if you want to set up a meeting with declan my other cat feel free to dm me thank you guys for making me feel less lonely on that trip i learned a few things number one don't stay in a scary house in the middle of the desert by yourself that's it that's all i learned thank you guys for hanging out with me thank you guys for making me feel less lonely on my trip i love you and you are so important to me and you are my bestie and here's your forehead kiss i'm gonna go to bed and enjoy my night of sleep in my comfortable bed and i will not be taking the digestive supplement that i took last night because i don't want to wake up at 4 am with sweaty clothes and diarrhea anyway i love you i'll see you around [Music] [Applause] [Music] you

-emma chamberlain",2021-05-02T17:37:19Z,198764,3377589,5543,what i'm about to do right now is going to frighten you kind of shut your eyes a little bit do a little bit of like this you know prepare yourself for what i'm about to do [Music] it feels so wrong but it feels so right i'm making matcha i know for any of you that even relatively know me the fact that i'm making matcha right now and not a coffee is probably shaking your reality everything you knew to be true is now false and i get that that's frightening but i'm having a matcha phase don't even ask what i'm doing like you can look up a matcha tutorial if you want to know how to make it i'm not i don't think i'm really good at what i'm doing here i enjoyed the flavor to a certain extent if you haven't had it before it tastes kind of like nutty dirt if you took hazelnuts and ground them up and then mix them with dirt that's what matcha tastes like to me but i weirdly like i weirdly like the flavor and i also really just like the color of it if it was not this green color you would never see me drinking it it's kind of like when you're dating somebody and you really don't like their personality but they're just like super hot i bought this [ __ ] matcha whisk on amazon like i'm doing the whole thing i'm doing the whole thing you take your cup pour your matcha over oh my god i just broke my [ __ ] glass okay i'm probably gonna swallow a piece of a shard of glass now because i think a shard of glass oh no there's definitely a piece of glass in this i don't care my body can handle it i just added some water and then i take a splash of this almond milk i'm trying this new one out it was recommended to me because it's literally like basically it's supposed to it kind of tastes similar to like homemade almond milk supposedly because it's just almonds and water it doesn't have anything else in it so it's supposed to kind of taste like when you make it yourself which i like look at that green color it's a little bit light i feel like i could probably use more matcha but it's definitely an acquired taste but i like it for some reason anyway i'm gonna go sit on the toilet because my stomach is killing me um so i have to go oh my god i just had a realization so when i'm filming this it's april 21st my birthday's may 22nd i have one month left one month and one day left of being a teenager i don't really care like it doesn't really bother me because i've felt like i've been 25 for like the past year you know i go to bed at like 10 30. so being 20 doesn't really scare me because i feel like i'm already there my life is already boring not that actually i feel like most 25 year olds actually have more fun than i do like they actually are like living a more youthful and exciting life than i do anyway uh sorry i just got back from sitting on the toilet i was on the toilet for about 20 minutes so just happy to be back happy to be done i'm anticipating the shard of glass to go down my throat any minute now i'm actually terrified i feel like my body can like handle it you know what i'm saying i don't know maybe not actually if i'm thinking about my body trying to like digest a small piece of glass oh my god imagine it in my poop okay i'll keep you guys updated if i end up getting a butthole cut when the shard of glass comes out the other end but anyways i have a mission today so i was on tick tock this is how all my ideas start basically i couldn't find the tick tock and i i would love to give the girl who came up with this idea of credit but i could not find her tick tock anywhere i apparently didn't even like it which was my bad because now i'm about to copy her and i don't know what her name is you know who you are out there if you created this idea i'm so sorry that i cannot give you credit right now i feel terrible and evil she took a plain white tank top and she took some letters and she spelled out something on a shirt and then she took spray fabric paint picture like spray paint but it's fabric paint and she sprayed over the letters used it as a stencil kind of and then you know kind of layered some colors in some cool ways and then she had a cool tank top that had words on it i love it i think it's genius today i'm going to go and try to kind of do my own version of that i think it'd be fun to have some spicy interesting tank tops to wear this summer the main reason why i'm doing this also is because it's an easy diy project this is not a hard diy project and i'm not in the mood to do anything remotely difficult ever actually i like this diy project as well because i feel like you can't really go wrong you know what i mean like how could you [ __ ] this up i also i'm getting my nails done because that's what we're dealing with let's do it it's taking a lot out of me right now not to go pick up a matcha on the way i just drank one i don't need to drink another one if i'm being completely honest with you guys i actually had another one before i started filming this so i've already had two today you know what i think it is i think the reason why i drink so many caffeinated drinks in a day is actually because i don't drink water so my body is trying to extract the hydration from these caffeinated drinks just to survive i haven't done a diy kind of project in a while but do you know what the funny thing about diy projects is half the time when i do a diy project i'll i'll love how it turned out but i'll never wear it but i think this is stuff i'll actually wear so i mean i'm crossing my fingers i'm thinking about the cost of everything i'm like i wonder how much this spray paint the spray fabric paint costs because if it's like ten dollars a bottle then this is not a cost-effective diy so we'll see if this is a cost-effective diy i don't know yet we will find out shortly sorry i did not mean to flip you off been having really bad indigestion y'all like i'm just like burping like and it hurts like my chest hurts because there's so much burp in it we have a rhyme [Music] guess where i'm going to get a matcha where how the [ __ ] do i get out of this parking garage how do i get out of here i don't understand this parking garage and i never have oh there we go i refuse to come to this target and i just did today because it was on the way home from jesus christ i normally don't come to this target because the parking garage is a nightmare but i did go to it today it was on the way home from the fabric store so i was like okay i'm not going to go to my way to go to the other target you know what i'm saying but this one the parking garage is built in a way that makes sense to only rocket scientists i'm not kidding the parking garage i know what's going on with me i'm hangry i'm hangry i i just figured it out i was like emma why are you being so negative and then i realize it's because i'm hungry i'm so excited to make these shirts i actually am genuinely very excited i will say though i spent quite a bit of money on this so i wouldn't say that this is necessarily a cost-effective diy going to the fabric store without fail makes me feel like an old woman every time and it could be because i'm surrounded by old women when i'm in there it's it's not really even a fabric store it's the craft store craft stores are so fun maybe next time i'm feeling like really bored and like sad i'll go to the craft store and just pick up some materials to make crafts i could get clay like polymer clay i could get fabric to sew something that's probably not going to happen anytime soon but still i feel like i belong in there because all of the old ladies that are in there i can just tell they're cat ladies and i know because i am one and so i can smell a cat lady from a mile away sometimes literally but always metaphorically and i just feel safe because i know that they understand me and i understand them it's like all we have at the end of the day is crafts our cats period bye it's the color that gets me it's gorgeous huh i just spilled it all over my phone i don't even care to be honest you know what they say about the iphone it's water resistant is it matcha resistant time won't tell i had a snack i'm no longer hangry so we can get started okay i'm putting the camera here so that you can see what i'm doing declan you can't do this every time i try to film you just can't i bought so many stickers like in random shapes like that i just thought could be cute on a shirt some stars some wine glasses before you judge me i just thought it could be maybe a circle could be useful oh my god guys look how fun this is okay so i have all these colors and now i can like literally do whatever i want see now it's time for me to be creative and i'm getting a little nervous i'll come back when i have something promising first i have one that says tgif literally the last time i did a diy i painted tj tgif on a shirt because i love fridays what can i say i'm a simple gal i did one that just has an 11 on it because that's my lucky number this one might get me in trouble but it's a bunch of wine glasses and wine bottles and then on the back it says almost 21 and i'm gonna wear this on my birthday my 20th birthday because that's funny right maybe not we'll see and then this one's just simple and it just has a bunch of hearts and stars on it because i just think it would be cute so let's give it a go honestly i mean i'm nervous because i feel like it might not work and if it doesn't work i'm gonna be very sad you put this into the shirt let's just get into it let's waste no more time oh my god this is fun this is fun but this is scary oh i feel like this is gonna work what other color maybe some pink around the hearts guys this is [ __ ] fun now this is a diy i can get behind maybe if i add some white it could be fun because it'll add oh see that's sick okay i'm excited i'm excited this so much serotonin has been released from this this just like fixed my whole day seriously this is so fun okay wait what do i do with it now i don't know what to do with it now if the stencils didn't work then i'm gonna cry for at least two days okay i'm gonna put it on a hanger this is fun guys no guys this is fun i have to do this almost 21 one are you kidding me it's so funny it's the only thing that you can do once you're 21 drink alcohol or is there other activities you should at least be able to rent a car or something so for this one i'm thinking purple because like colored wine you know maybe like purple on this side and maybe some green on this side and then maybe some black okay now i might be overdoing it this is so fun guys this is my new favorite hobby this is literally my new favorite hobby see i feel like this is gonna be gorgeous seriously this is too fun i'm really nervous to see what they turn out like though because i'm like i'm like getting excited a little bit prematurely what can i say i'm having a good time you know i feel like i could have fun just like free-for-alling one too let's give it a go we'll start with pink [ __ ] it pink okay ah maybe add some orange a little blue maybe add some yellow it kind of just looks like tie-dye but if you use your imagination it looks cooler than tie-dye listen i'm proud of it like that looks sick it's like abstract art you know what i mean you don't like it only needs to make sense to you god i'm mind blown at how fun this diy this is the first diy project i've done in probably like 10 years where i was like wait this is actually fun okay this shirt feels pretty much dry let's see how well the stencils did stop it works way better than i thought sorry get a second it's cute wait it's really cute yo they would sell that no stop pov you see this at urban outfitters you aren't even blinking an eye like this completely fits you know what i'm sorry about everything i've ever said about tick-tock yes it can be an extremely negative platform but if you get some inspiration from it it's worth a little bit of the pain oh my god should i get a shirt should i make a shirt this is mommy on it see look there's so much potential we'll do a try on haul later okay i'm gonna make the rest of these and listen to music um and enjoy myself and we'll do a try on haul later when i tell you i'm about to build an entirely new wardrobe using these spray fabric paints like i'm not kidding this is my new passion i can't believe how good they turned out i'm rusty on the drums i'm not gonna lie i haven't been playing enough but it's because i've been reading you guys probably know this by now considering i've talked about it a lot i'm in bed see it's nice when you do something creative then you feel like you can get into bed and you feel proud you're like you know what i did something with my day like i can lay in bed and that's okay anyway i'm going to read until further notice i feel tired guys i completely forgot i had a nail appointment at 3 15. it's 3 20 now i should not be vlogging camera should not be on right now i should be in there getting my nails done anyway these are what they look like now magic transition okay it was one of those moments today when i was getting my nails done where like she did the first coat of this color and it was really like bright purple almost and i was like oh that's not what i wanted but then she did the second coat and now it's like navy blue purple indigo vibes which i like although they are really pointy like they're very pointy you see what i'm saying i'm not gonna lie you guys i'm [ __ ] exhausted i've been exhausted all day and i and it's not just like a little tired because like i'm always a little bit tired like that's not abnormal like i feel like i could go to bed like i feel like there's something wrong with me oh i'm exhausted should i just go get another matcha i've literally been there four times in the past two days but yes i'm gonna get another one i'm going to [ __ ] get another matcha because i want to and i'm not gonna let the inner mom voice inside of my head control me because i'm not kidding if you guys heard the dialogue i had between myself and myself in my own brain it's like a mother and a child it's a mixture of you need to take care of yourself can we cause a ruckus inside of my brain and they're just bumping heads 24 7. i feel the life coming back into me the real question is do i even like the flavor of matcha every time i drink it i'm like do i like this and then i finish it and then i want more it doesn't make sense i am so tired for what and you know how i know that i'm tired when i got home just now i re-heated leftovers for dinner and i was excited about it now listen i like leftovers i don't have anything against them i eat them all the time but i'm never like excited about it but today i was like excited that i had leftovers i was like thank god i have leftovers because i was not gonna cook something you know what i'm saying like that's how you know i want to read some of my book but i know that if i start reading it i'm going to go straight to like i'm literally going to fall asleep so i'm wearing a matching set right now i'm not kidding i haven't worn a matching set like a matching sweatpant sweatshirt sweat set in probably like three months and i forgot how great they are i don't think there's anything better like this is all i want to wear out ever again you know what my period might be coming because i'm like i'm tired i'm like i've been talking about matching sweatpants and sweatshirt for like two minutes and i've been whining a lot today so there's something wrong like something's in the air i'm about to go to bed like literally it's almost bedtime for me i'm done but we need to do a try on haul of all the shirts we made today duh before i go to bed i just finished cropping all of them let's do a little fashion show tgif if someone told me that they bought this at urban outfitters i would say send me the link i wouldn't be like you're [ __ ] me this looks cool don't look at the back of my head it's not cute right now this turned out so cute i'm obsessed with it honestly i think that this is easier than tie-dye and it looks cooler i'm again obsessed this next one is so cute we have the little wine bottles the little whatever almost 21. i'm gonna wear this on my birthday i think it's funny don't take it too seriously okay it's not that deep guys i know how the internet worked you guys are gonna be like there's alcohol on your shirt that's inappropriate well take a joke look how good the words turned out on the back i need to make more of these i'm literally gonna make more of these tomorrow i'm not getting them to go back out to the store and buy 50 of these tank tops and just make a bunch random ones this one might be the cutest one why are these so good they look professionally done okay this one's adorbs last but not least the 11. this is my new lucky shirt every time i wear this shirt hopefully something good happens to me because 11 is my lucky number and my favorite number do this diy like seriously i'm never going to be a diy channel i'm never going to be the diy channel of your dreams that you want me to be i won't i won't ever but i will tell you this is a good one and you need to try it we're in bed now you guys i really appreciate you guys hanging out with me today as i always do i had very much fun and i love you so much and here's your forehead kiss do a little diy project this week it doesn't necessarily need to be the t-shirt diy that i did but do something diy do something creative i think it's really good for us maybe eat some leftovers maybe cook something new either way i'll see you guys next week forehead kiss number two

-emma chamberlain",2021-04-25T17:22:24Z,287667,5190485,17872,hi it's 7am i'm up i'm up i feel like this needs looks like it needs more coffee good morning i'm not the same person i was in the last video i made i'm not kidding there's been a shift in me it all started when i decided to go to the beach a few days ago by myself i decided to bring a book with me now if i'm being honest i did not bring the book to the beach because i was like oh emma you're for sure gonna read this in fact i was like emma you're definitely not gonna read this you're gonna put this in your bag just to make your bag useful and then you're not even gonna pull it out once you get to the beach well i was wrong i got to the beach i pulled out my book and i started reading it and over the last week i've fallen in love with reading something about it has changed me i can't name one time you guys have ever seen me do the dishes i have this newfound inspiration for life from reading becoming a new book reader has made me uh if we're being really honest less depressed i don't know why and i can't believe it i think the reason why i've been less depressed recently is because instead of going on my phone when i'm laying in bed by myself i read reading is harmless going on social media is not harmless makes you sad it makes you compare yourself to other people makes you depressed it's no bueno why is my pants still dirty and i put it in the dishwasher okay nothing a little extra scrubby debbie can't fix the only one bad thing about reading is that now i feel like i need to now i keep using all these big words in conversations not like big words but like let's say on a day-to-day basis i'm normally talking at like an eighth grade vocabulary level nothing a little extra scrubby debbie can't fix well since starting reading i maybe have unlocked the part of my brain that holds all of the 10th grade vocabulary words and now i'm starting to bring him out to play and i can't imagine how annoying it is for people around me they're like emma you don't need to use the word extravagantly to describe something very mediocre see but then i just use the word like mediocre like why am i doing this it's like something about it wait i don't think that i ran the dishwasher with all the [ __ ] in it because it's like all the stuff's kind of dirty like i just started unloading the dishwasher but everything's dirty whatever all jokes aside i'm now a new advocate of reading and the funny thing is i i talked about this my podcast anything goes podcast if you want to check it out i think i've read maybe like five books in my whole life for pleasure that weren't for like a homework assignment or something like that like usually i'm not reading for me like i'm reading to get a good grade i'm reading for some sort of ulterior motive but my dad was like emma you need to start reading like this is so good like it's helping me get off my phone and it's probably gonna be even better for you and more useful and i was like okay shut up i'm never gonna read i'm not somebody who like you know i'm just not a reader and so like when i ordered my first book and like picked it up for the first time i got about like three pages in and then i realized that i actually had forgotten how to read i would read a whole page i'd flip to the next page and then i realized oh wait i absorbed no knowledge or information from that page then i'd go back and read the page again and i'd read the whole thing and i'd flip to the next page and then i'd be like uh still didn't really understand what happened but guess what now i can read smoothly in efficiency efficiently efficiently smooth and efficiently there's something about reading a book especially if it's about history or it's like based about based in history like even if it's a fictional book if it's kind of like based around history or something like that that especially can be very grounding because it shows you oh people have been you know having the same struggles for bazillions of years right and then when you go on your phone and go on social media you you see right through it for some reason because your brain when you're reading is conditioned to like put things into perspective you're less likely to be like oh [ __ ] my homies in the bahamas i'm pissed because you just see everything for what it is and you're like well who knows if he's even having a good time i don't care i'm just going to enjoy my life for what it is feel free to leave book recommendations in the comments let's have uh that was extreme i'm wet now that's what she said actually she probably doesn't say that very often it feels good to start the day in a clean kitchen i've never been somebody who prioritized cleanliness but since my book reading renaissance i am a changed woman i wake up at seven i clean my kitchen i make my coffee i get back into bed i read i get up i take a walk possibly i start working on something productive i get back in bed i read more i cook i read more then i go on my phone for a little bit because i'm human back to the book reading more and that's my daily schedule now these days hi declan yeah cat mom life whatever i'm on one this morning it's cause i was talking about books [Music] oh didn't see there i was reading you honestly okay watch me like accidentally like fall in love with books to a point where like it becomes a romantic thing like on the show my strange addiction where a guy like falls in love with his car i really am falling in love with reading and i kind of want to talk about it just a little bit more i know you're like emma can you just cook something or like do a haul or like do your makeup routine like shut the [ __ ] up about books i've talked about this before on every platform i have my podcast especially going on my phone too much makes me sad the problem is when i'm in bed and i'm relaxing as every human does the first thing i do is go on my phone because it's like the only thing i can think of doing if i'm not doing that i'm watching you know tv shows or you know youtube videos and stuff like that and all of that is great in moderation but i needed something else to do in my bed that wasn't media i needed some form of entertainment that wasn't media to disconnect me from the virtual realm the only thing that exists is book it's so amazing it's so amazing and once you get into the swing of it you can't stop it's addictive you learn more words your vocabulary gets better and stronger you start using the word extravagant a lot you might start using the word whilst instead of wild like wait whilst whilst whilst you might start feeling smarter than everybody else that's okay maybe you are i don't know what i'm gonna do today but this is step one [Music] okay i've done all my hobbies for the day like i read my book i [ __ ] played drums what now oh my god i just remembered it's literally eight in the morning my neighbors are definitely like can you stop i get it i get it i'd be angry if i was them i don't know what i'm doing um i have all my groceries i just went grocery shopping yesterday in fact i've been going grocery shopping like every day because i like genuinely enjoy going to the grocery store but i've been like too many days in a row and i'm like overly stocked up on things don't need to go there definitely don't need to spend any money on clothes i literally just went on d-pop last night which i haven't done in a while d-pop's like a thrifting app i went on d-pap last night and spent money what do i do it's time to cook oh look magically these two pieces of bread are on my cutting board what what in the world could i be making i haven't had avocado toast in a really long time i just like forgot that it existed we're gonna make avocado toast right now so i kind of forgot how i make it to be honest this one's like not ripe yet [ __ ] if i'm opening an unripe avocado i'm gonna be sad whatever it's pretty perfect okay so we have half of an avo i saw that it's like going viral to put honey on your avocado toast but that's just like not something i can get behind now we're gonna add spices oh ew there's like a [ __ ] no oh it's like a weird like stem in it that makes me so grossed out okay first we're gonna add salt decent amount of salt okay probably too much what i just did pepper okay we're gonna do chili flakes this is the worst this is the worst one this isn't ah why'd i scream okay whatever chili flakes onion hopefully i don't see anyone today we're gonna add a little bit of lemon that's probably good okay i feel good about that mixture mmm guacamole i don't want to wait for my toast to toast okay we're going to make one half now and the other half when it's ready hmm cute what is this in my avocado no get yours okay let's give this a go yes yeah yeah beautiful you know when avocados have strings in them like little strings i can't deal with that brunch is served that easy i don't know what i'm gonna do for the rest of my day really i might just continue to read it's friday it's a day of relaxation it's kind of warm out maybe i should like lay out in the sun and get a little tan we'll see where the universe guides me declan hi i'm done reading for the day i feel like i'm wasting the day reading okay wait that's so contradictory from what i was saying earlier i'm not wasting the day but like it's a great day out it's a beautiful day out i'm inside i'm reading which is great but maybe i should go outside i've been trying to work on my tan and the uv is literally an eight right now which if you don't know what the uv is oh my god it's a nine i'm going out i'm tanning this i can get tan okay when the uv index is really high which is like the strength of the sun rays or something you can get tan it's like that can that tells you how quickly you can get tan we're gonna set up a little beach vacation in my backyard right now and try to make tanning fun i'm even gonna bring my book putting on some sunscreen i don't really put it on the rest of my body which is probably not good but i do put it on my face and my neck don't forget your sunscreen kids why is this lighting so bad it's tan time i look awful listen it's not fun to tan like tanning's not fun but i like getting the vitamin d like it's worth it it's worth it it's a grind but it's worth it i really should have made a coffee before i came out here but now i'm like already in it you know what i mean so it's like okay can't go back now you know i did it i think i should get my book out yes i brought a bag into my own backyard because i wanted to feel like i was at the beach should i do a quick what's in my beach bag okay what's in my beach bag haul give this video a thumbs up number one i have a pair of glasses that i forgot were in here enjoy that my book because i'm literally so smart i have my reading glasses literally like who the [ __ ] wears reading glasses when they're outside tanning just doesn't the vibes don't align like the aesthetic does not align oh i have a tampon i don't need that out here but it was in my bag already so i'm not going to fight it oh i have a chapstick um i have a hair tie all right turn it up turn it up i have my phone oh ah my phone but now is sand all over it because i bring this bag to the beach every time i go to the beach and that's uh what's in my beach bag haul hope you guys enjoyed i think i'm gonna read my [ __ ] book what is this what is this vlog this vlog is just moments in between me reading my book all right i'll see you guys hi i'm so tired from laying in the sun does that happen to you guys too it's time to start cooking i'm in the mood for a stir fry that's what we're gonna do so anyways um what's going on the only thing i know how to talk about is what's going on in my book but unfortunately i'm like the only one that's reading it so maybe there are some um there are some negative side effects to reading which is that all you want to talk about is the book that you're reading but unless you're a part of a book club you're kind of [ __ ] i always thought the book clubs were so stupid like the concept of it i was always like uh why but i kind of get it because there's something like when you're reading a book it's like you want to talk about it with somebody luckily my dad has read this book so i've been able to talk to him about it but i don't know i think i kind of get why why [ __ ] moms like to go to their book clubs i think i get it now listen i can only imagine that you know the moms that go to book clubs aren't just going to the book club to talk about books they're also probably at the book club to talk about their cheating husband or something of that sort but i get it you know what i may actually need to go to the grocery store today that could be a fun activity because if i don't go to the grocery store [ __ ] i'm not leaving the house actually i am going to dinner tonight finally doing something relatively interesting with my life right maybe i'll do a little get ready with me for dinner later you want to know what i cooked the other day so you know how starbucks has those egg white bites well i was like i'm not gonna go to starbucks to get this i'm gonna try to make them myself i'll show you they look so gross egg white bites okay sounds fun in theory they're really not that good should i even explain what i'm cooking here or does it even matter [ __ ] it it doesn't matter okay fine i'll tell you i'm making i make this tempeh y'all tempeh is so good like i have grown to love it so much i literally don't even know what tempeh is but i love it so we have that okay now we make the sauce i've literally showed how to do this if i had a peanut allergy i would not i don't think i'd know how to go through life do you know what the sauce needs water you don't want to put too much water in your sauce or else the whole thing will go to [ __ ] i think that's perfect look at that consistency oh look at this sauce okay that was a huge peanut butter chunk i clearly the whisk did not work love oh i don't know how to explain what just happened but there's peanut sauce all over the lens i mean that's why you can't see me right now oh my god literally just my luck that oh my god oh no literally my camera fell straight into the food i don't know what i'm more upset about the fact that my food has all the bacteria for my camera on it or the other way around watch me literally need to get oh my god this is like permanently bad huh oh my god well it kind of looks like i look like an angel right now oh hi we're back okay well you basically virtually tasted my peanut sauce what did you think i can't okay hold on hold on sorry hold on give me one sec okay hi i've made the decision that i need to get some fresh air i'm literally wearing slippers though like we're this is not an athletic walk this is like a light stroll okay i have quite a bit of time before i need to get ready for dinner if i don't use this time wisely and i don't go on a walk or something i will go on tick tock and waste the next three hours rotting my brain it is a beautiful evening it's so like nice and warm i am kind of frightened of being judged by my neighbors because i don't think this is a very normal occurrence you can go on a walk at any time you can just pick up and go on a walk at any time you can be wearing anything you want look at what i'm wearing right now i'm wearing [ __ ] slippers okay and i'm still making it happen you know i can say all i want about how much i hate la but the weather in the spring and summer during the evening oh my god it's next level it's so nice also i can't even imagine how psychotic this looks with me with my [ __ ] camera with the like microphone and leftover peanut sauce all over my lens i'm just gonna walk for a while i didn't bring my phone because i was like i don't want to even have it actually i probably should have brought my phone huh it's not really safe whatever i did karate as a kid so i feel like if anybody tries to hurt me i could like use a combination of my peanut butter sauce covered lens and like my fists and to defend myself i feel like that's more than enough i'll see you after my walk hi i just got out of the shower i only washed my body as you can tell by my disgusting oh my god my hair looks really bad i don't even know if i want to put that on the internet like that might even be too real for even me oh i think i like matched my shade really well today i mixed two shades it actually kind of went well which really never happened so that feels like an accomplishment yes i'm rubbing the excess on my neck it's called efficiency recently oh i really got a lot on my lips um recently i've been wearing orangey eyeshadow even if i'm like just wearing makeup to like go to the store just because i want to get dressed up like i will wear orange eyeshadow it's minor it's not crazy but there's a reason why i do this and it's because every time i wear orange eyeshadow i get compliments on my eyes at no other time do i get compliments on my eyes strangers will come up to me but if i'm not wearing orange eyeshadow it doesn't happen i actually get uncomfortable when people give me compliments and i'm really bad at taking compliments i'll give you a scenario of how i behave when i'm receiving a compliment pov somebody says to me emma you look really pretty today what's my response ah no i don't i literally don't and here's why um number one i had diarrhea earlier i honestly this is so bad but like i am trying to teach myself and every day i'm teaching myself to believe people when they give me a compliment this is when things get scary because we're doing cream contour i used to do this and then i stopped because i got lazy but i'm like trying to incorporate it again but it's a scary product to use because i like literally don't know what i'm doing like that's too much oh my god way too much definitely going to contour the jawline like does that even do anything honestly kinda i don't know if like the forehead contour thing is my thing but tonight it's gonna have to be my thing cause i just put it on you know what this actually isn't so bad i didn't do too terrible of a job we're gonna do cream highlight i'm i'm getting into creamy makeup like i i had a phase like a few years ago where i was into creamy makeup and then i stopped because it's like kind of more work like you have to really put like your elbow grease into it a little bit more like you have to do this motion like dab your face and [ __ ] like that's a lot of work okay so i got this new lip plumper guys i'm gonna be brutally honest with you like my favorite makeup product might be lip plumper okay now it comes into the eye shadow time where we're going big orange i just i've had this palette forever okay and i found it in the bottom of my drawer and i was like this is perfect for me okay i take like this lighter shade and then this kind of orange shade lightly dusted all over my lid done that's all i do i don't even do anything in the crease i don't even really clean it up i'm not trying to complicate things for myself here okay but i actually do do kind of one more thing so then i take this darker like reddish shade and then i do my lower thing i look a little bit weird today there's something off with my makeup did i forget a step oh i did actually miss a step oh my god i did i like to take highlighter dip my finger in it a tiny bit and just put it in my inner corner it really does actually make a how [ __ ] i just poke my eyeball you guys saw that i've been getting a lot of comments that i like curl my eyelashes wrong and i don't know what i do wrong like please correct my form here what am i doing wrong i don't have my phone near me to google how i'm supposed to be curling my eyelashes i don't feel like i'm doing it wrong like this seems right like what help you guys have any makeup tips for me please share now this is when things get fun oh my god i'm literally oh i kind of do have a lazy eye huh it's all right i'm gonna do lip liner then i use the lipstick i know i never thought i'd be you know a person who uses lipstick i'm growing up oh i need to add a lip gloss i'm gonna have this shimmery bay matches my eye shadow cute and that's the final look first let's pick out outerwear i already know what i want to wear are you kidding me i'm obsessed with this that's cute i'm going to save you the pain of watching me go into my closet and pick out pants for this outfit so we're just gonna cut to the chase here i'm ready okay let's get right on in close thank you guys for hanging out with me all day today i hope that you guys pick up a book by chance maybe can you stop making loud sounds right now okay i feel like i was actually too mean to him it's okay you can make a little bit of loud sounds sorry i think i hurt his feelings look up online what eye shadow color complements your eye color start wearing that eyeshadow color that's what i want you to take from this video anyway i'm gonna be late to dinner but i love you so much and i had so much fun hanging out with you and i'm gonna hang out with you again and again and again there is your forehead kiss bye wish me luck at dinner

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-04-18T17:51:35Z,332480,4563271,11468,hi [Music] never in my life have i received more comments about something in my life i feel like my comment section on every platform for the past month or so has been the exact same and for whatever reason it's people asking me to share what i'm gonna be wearing this summer i it's like a phenomenon i don't get it i like i don't understand how this happened i don't understand why everybody's asking me but i'm so honored at first i was like okay guys i don't even know what i'm wearing for summer i can't do this i can't make a video about this like i don't even know what i'm doing i don't even have a plan yet i decided i was i just have to get it together figure it out and i have to share it with you guys because you know what if this is what you want from me i'm going to give it to you because i care about you you're my best friend i will do anything for you so if you want to know what i'm going to wear this summer i'm i'm in i'll tell you i'll share i'll share a few months ago i did a video where i where i did 21 outfit ideas for 2021. i kind of hate those outfits now like looking back they were not great some of them were good and then like half of them were like really bad and that was because i thought it'd be a good idea to pick them out as i was filming and then that in that ended up making the filming process nine hours long and so by the end the outfits were getting a little bit weird i can promise you that won't happen again um i've been picking these out over the last few days and i feel very proud of these summer outfits and i think that you guys are gonna love that the thing about summer and summer fashion is that it's very minimalist you know what i mean you're not wearing a lot of clothes because it's hot out there's not a lot of room for creativity but there also is you just have to think outside of the box a little bit so i'm really gonna try to think outside of the box this summer and um you know what let's waste no more time let's get into what i'm going to be wearing this summer outfit number one this is the outfit this is my summer outfit nine out of ten days six out of seven days a week levi's shorts white tank top the reason why this is my go-to is because the opportunities are endless let me show you it looks great with any shoe you can pair it with a birkenstock you can pair it with like a simple little sneaker okay compare it with a little loafer a little doc marten the opportunities are endless not to mention you can spice it up add a little top a cute little button-up cute little detail you know what i'm saying like that's cute you could take a sweater if you're maybe going to the beach and it might be a little bit chilly little sailboat detail because it's summer baby it's time to start going on sailboats something a little bit more elevated like this sheer button up it's pretty it's flowy you can literally wear this outfit with anything and you can accessorize it too throw a hat on you look badass any hat looks good literally any color hat because it's neutral so you can do anything if you're like hey you know what i want to do a crazier hat you still look badass or you could throw things on top of it easily this is kind of a sheer sweater it still has the tag on it so please ignore that oh you could throw something kind of sheer on top i don't know if i like that actually at the end of the day if you're ever stumped on a summer outfit and you're like i don't know what to do this is your fit this is your go-to staple summer fit you want to know what i wore to the beach the other day and it's perfect just get a white tank top and get a pair of denim shorts that you love and the rest is history but if you're like emma i don't just want to wear a white tank top in denim shorts every day i have some other ideas number two number one i'm obsessed with the beach pant thing like i know it's a little bit reminiscent of your least favorite aunt on beach vacations i understand that but i think there's something kind of fun about them and listen i made a controversial choice and decided to wear the birkenstock clog things you don't have to do this and you don't have to do anything that i'm actually saying ever so just getting that out there but anyway you can pair these with other shoes this is just what i like the best i like these for summer they're a little bit frumpy they're a little bit ugly they're a little bit vegan looking i love little knit hats little lace detail here and this is it throw in a little jacket just in case because you know even when it's summer it still gets cold sometimes but i love this you can really pair these beach pants in so many different ways too like these are so versatile you can literally just throw them over a bathing suit and go to the beach they're so great and they're comfortable i don't know if they're trendy but i like them for some odd reason moving on what up number three this one's a little bit more goofy but i love a good pattern knit short vintage tee a little hat maybe a little glasses to pull in the shoes i decided to wear these loafers oh my god i've not shaved my legs in forever ew okay i honestly like it the best like without accessories i kind of just like it like this you know like i picture me at a barbecue or something of that sort um it is kind of bothering me that these blues don't match this is very barbecue outfit you know what i'm saying this is giving me very this is serving me very i barbecue me a good vintage roxy vintage quick silver beachy vibe i have these beachy pants i paired it once again with the controversial birkenstock clog i feel like these may be the shoe of the season don't take my word for it this is just such like an effortless but comfortable outfit i love taking inspiration from california in the 90s and earlier i just feel like a beachy gal right now you know what i mean like i'm i'm playing into the beachy stereotype i enjoy doing that and this is kind of cute right see the other thing let's take it back to my first outfit the white tank top and the denim shorts you can mix and match you know what i'm gonna show you okay do you see my point here this is your saving grace you can't go next we're playing into two things i love here number one denim vest are you kidding me it's nice and breathable some air can get circulate through it so that you don't get too hot also some cut off shorts obviously a staple but these are a little bit more spicy because they have some painting on them paired with some little doc martens and you've got a summer fit baby not shamed my armpit recently either i'm really not i'm not very clean shaved right now it's okay though i'm just being mean next uh this one is interesting because i am getting into skirts this one's see-through and i think it would look cuter with a bathing suit underneath but i'm wearing shorts for obvious reasons super light flowy comfortable this would be a great like these cute little skirts would be a great cover up for the beach add a little jacket just in case it gets cold some fun 70s patterns i don't know i feel good about it the shorts do look a little bit weird huh pretend i'm wearing a bathing suit or something but also look i don't know what it is but i'm loving these longer skirts especially with these i don't know why i don't know i can't explain the phenomenon i just don't like how short skirts feel i constantly feel like i'm gonna flash someone if i move my leg i feel safe secure comfortable in these longer skirts and they're actually quite chic let's get long skirts going i'm into it i'm all about it baby next this is just perfect 90s vibes we have these cute little track shorts touristy sweatshirt little ball cap matching like cover matching little yellow sneakers i mean this is comfortable cute come on you can't go wrong with this i love these shorts so much i love the kind of like retro track short look oh my god would wear it every day if i could and maybe i will so yeah how are we liking this video so far do you guys like it comment down below and give this a thumbs up subscribe watch every video i've ever posted before comment on every video i've ever posted before follow me on instagram like every post i've ever posted comment subscribe and turn on post notifications all right back to the video i don't feel like i need to make a comment on this one i think it speaks for itself god bless you sporty look why not okay listen i know you guys might be like emma why are you wearing biker shorts i thought that you hated them i kind of do hate them but sometimes they're cute for a little sporty look you know what some days i am feeling this way like some days i'm like i want to be sporty spice i know nothing about the spice girls i was born in 2001 it just isn't my generation but if i was a spice girl in this outfit i would be sporty spice probably biker shorts are very hit or miss for me i kind of hate them cute little white tank top although this one has some details so it's a little bit different and then this is just a cute little whatever and then some cute little platform sneakers have fun be yourself i can't help myself i love a little preppy moment i do i really do these shorts are so cute to me i've been wearing them for years i think i've had these for probably two years and i bring them out every summer because they're like the perfect golf dad preppy shorts and these as you can probably tell are my favorite shoe right now because they're like a dog martin but a loafer it's like my dream shoe i don't know why i didn't buy them sooner this outfit works well with any knit vest cardigan let me show you cute i love the aesthetic of golf dads i personally didn't have a golf dad my dad did not play golf but for some reason i'm obsessed with their aesthetic and i don't even know where that obsession came from but i'm not i never fight it i just let myself be me the white dickies are making an appearance because they're a really great summer pant white is very summer vibes wearing these shoes again nobody's surprised i mean it's simple it's easy it's effective it's a little bit unique but it's still comfy i mean so i couldn't decide what shoe i liked better so i have a little slide these are so fun i also have a little sneaker um this is just a super comfy like cute on the go outfit the little fabric shorts are so great because they're so comfortable this little striped mock neck is giving me very much sailor vibes which of course is summer af rock ah let's keep it moving people i couldn't help myself i can't stop being preppy literally i'm dressed like a golf dad a dad who plays golf who loves cheese and wine like that is my aesthetic i have this like little button-down knit lightweight kind of well it's actually kind of thick cute little baseball cap new balance sneakers that match yes i was a cheerleader when in doubt channel your inner golf dad that's what i'm learning from this say hi to your friends how's my golf swing come on how was that i feel like this outfit gives me automatic form seriously well i'm wearing a button-up and i'm wearing denim shorts and i'm wearing a terry cloth hat and i'm wearing my controversial birkenstocks and i feel like i am a mom that's about to go water my garden love a little unbuttoned button down like buttoned in the top half and then not in the bottom it's fun it's flowy i'm getting into hats now i used to hate hats like when i tell you i used to hate hats like you would never see me in a hat i hated them but they're really growing on me and i'm really about it now so give hats a try this is a very cute colorful playful fun outfit with the zebra print and the little pops of green little track skirt little doc martens platform i just feel playful i'm not a huge fan of animal prints but i feel like occasionally throwing in a little zebra print for fun never hurt anyone okay we're kind of back to preppy a little bit love the little pops of plaid i've always been a plaid girl also these dad shorts are back in a different color i have them in three colors they're just so cute and then y'all i'm really a broken record at this point i mean fun little pop of glasses to tie the whole thing together seriously it's a party over here we're going preppy mode again cute little sweater vest with the collared shirt underneath it a year-round staple cute little sweatshorts that have this little detail and i literally can't believe i'm saying this but i'm wearing these again if you learn one thing from this video it's that you might want to get a pair of these i have nothing to say about this okay i'm just severely i'm severely comfortable in this outfit like i'd go to sleep in this but i'd also wear this to the beach and that's when you know you found your perfect summer fit these are another staple you can wear these with anything jeans shorts like these are unstoppable and a little bit less ugly than the clogged version love a good pair of soft sweatshorts and a cute little cropped tank top that's not white i feel kind of like a little polly pocket right now in these with this color scheme like this color scheme is giving me very polly pockets rock on moving on i thought i had a sneeze now this outfit is very vegan this trio here i mean i look like i'm about to go plant a tree like it's next level but i feel like it's cute i love cute little dainty tops like this and they're kind of hard to find like it's hard to find ones that are perfect but i thrifted this one and i do love it i feel so delicate in this shirt and i feel so gentle i feel like a gentle person in this shirt and i paired it with levi's because i just they're just my they're my day ones last but not least this is it this is all you get this is the last one it's preppy again no shocker little tennis shoes little plaid vintage random shorts that have built-in underwear that are very uncomfortable but whatever cute little collared pink and we're done that's what i'm wearing this summer that's it that was really fun you guys i had so much fun i'm actually really excited to wear a lot of those outfits i feel like this summer is going to be so much fun i'm really manifesting it because last summer was a little bit iffy so i'm i'm really crossing my thingies that we have an amazing summer i hope you guys enjoyed these outfits even if you hated every single one i at least hope that you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-04-11T18:26:27Z,257724,5528049,8828,anyway good morning ben [Music] y'all i've been going to bed at like what 9 30 p.m and i wake up just ready to attack the day but it comes at a cost he's going to bed at 9 30 is kind of sad like there's something kind of sad about it because you're like really like i'm missing out on you know a whole segment of the day which is night time but you know makes me feel good so on my grandma [ __ ] i actually might make tea too because i've been making tea so does anybody else ever like let's say you have a shopping bag like i forget to bring my reusable bags to the grocery store which happens more times than i wish to admit and i end up getting a paper bag i will just fill it with trash like that's what's happening right here like i i got this i got a gift in this bag and i'm now using it as a makeshift trash bag this is a vintage chamberlain chamberlain coffee mug it's vintage because this is the old logo so recently i haven't been doing almond milk in my cold brew i just put in dairy free creamer i don't know it just it makes the coffee flavor more intense i'm using a cookie butter flavor mixed with the vanilla flavor because i'm feeling funky on this i have no idea what day i was gonna say like this friday morning but i don't know what day of the week it is if somebody was like emma i'd give you 50 bucks to tell me what day the week it is right now i would be 50 50 bucks i'd be out i'd be out 50 bucks yummy oh definitely you didn't see it but declan just attacked my leg this teacup is very dirty so i've been trying to spend more time outside whenever i can get it in there you know what i mean because it's so easy for me to just lay in my bed get no vitamin d and feel like [ __ ] listen i live in los angeles best weather in the world except for not really in my opinion but you know some people argue best weather in the world do people even argue that so it's like i need to take advantage of it at least i've been tanning the last few days outside i'll lay outside for probably an hour 30 minutes on my tummy tummy who the [ __ ] says tummy that was creepy 30 minutes on my stomach 30 minutes on my back because i'm just trying to get a nice tan for summer you know summer's coming i mean the feeling of getting into your bed at night after you've laid out all day and gotten a good tan i mean it's priceless but the thing about it is that it's my least favorite thing to do and i'll explain why i mean it's very simple i hate sweating it takes forever my phone will overheat it's just it's not fun it's not fun it isn't it's not but it's worth it it's very worth it i just got back from a trip to new york i'm i'm definitely a little bit bummed out to be back in la but at the same time the weather is warm the sun's out the uv is high if you don't know what the uv is it's how strong the sun is i think don't even quote me on that so i'm trying to enjoy la for you know what it is a sunny place that has a lot of youtubers in it it's time to make brunch because it's not quite breakfast but it's not quite lunch so it's brunch i'm just gonna lay out some ingredients we have some sunflower seeds lemon juice fake meat mmm fake meat kale some avocado dijon mustard tahini i was thinking i was gonna make put parmesan cheese on it but i think that my parmesan cheese is rotten so we're not gonna do that oh olive oil okay let's see what we can make here we're gonna make an extra fun kale salad in here this is dirty we're gonna add a lot of olive oil some tahini not too much because i always [ __ ] up and add too much and then it ends up tasting weird we're gonna add some dijon mustard not too much of that either because i've made that mistake before oh we could add some maple syrup to kind of sweeten it up a little bit tiny bit of maple syrup that's too much maybe a little bit of this everyday seasoning a little bit of salt let's give it a go oh it needs lemon it's pretty [ __ ] good fresh from my garden you know what's actually interesting there are so many things like so many basic things that i don't know how to do i'll give you examples number one i don't know how to mail a letter and that might sound like funny to some of you i could not tell you how to mail a letter i don't i wouldn't if somebody was like hey here's um some seeds you should try to grow a plant with this wouldn't know how to grow a plant like i have no idea how to run a garden all of my plants in my home are fake i'm pretty sure or i'd hope so because i'm not watering them kale is one of my favorite vegetables but only if it's groomed correctly like it can go wrong quick this like really thick step no no like this stem listen to the skin break that's like there's a lot of fibers in there it's disgusting whatever i mean i am a picky eater like when i was little i used to eat the weirdest [ __ ] oh my god you know what we should do later should i order all the weird foods i used to eat as a kid and then we can try them together like for example my subway sandwich order i'm not gonna spoil it because i think i'm gonna order it later and then we can try it and the way i used to eat pizza was like disgraceful oh my god we're gonna do this later i'm gonna order all the foods oh my god the way i used to eat french fries was even weird there's a lot of foods that i used to hate like i used to hate avocados i hated avocados for years now they're my that's my [ __ ] that's my [ __ ] bestie right there okay i think that that's enough kale that's a lot sprinkle a little olive oil in a little salt and then you massage your kale this is crucial for a delicious salad okay now we add toppings okay so let's add the avocado avocado will make or break a salad like i honestly i don't think you can eat a salad without avocado in it and that's crazy coming from somebody that literally used to despise avocados as a kid and what's weird about avocados is they don't have like a super distinct flavor profile like what do they even really taste like you know what actually made me realize that i liked avocados was avocado toast because i was just trying to be a trendy indie indie kid by eating avocado toast avocados in what now oh i have this vegan meat this is technically tempeh bacon which i've never actually tried so i should probably try it before i add it in my salad it's pretty [ __ ] good actually god it really does kind of taste like bacon that's weird now we'll add some sunflower seeds now we add the dressing it's almost like kind of a season no it's not i was going to say it's kind of like a cereal salad but it's really nothing like a caesar salad so i don't know where i was going with that or where i got that idea mixing i like it so yeah i'm out of here okay i'm back in bed i'm gonna order all of the weird foods i used to eat you guys don't understand how weird my food preferences work i'm not gonna spoil it but i'm gonna order everything and then we're gonna try it all and i'm going to end up eating it eating everything i ordered over the next few days because i don't want to waste it and these foods are weird so like i don't even know if i can [ __ ] order the stuff i want because it's that weird like can i order a custom sandwich let's see oh can i not order a custom sandwich i swear oh you can okay great my sandwich order i'm so excited to share this with you i really hope i've never talked about this because it's embarrassing i i get three things on my sandwich the person who's making the sandwich for me is gonna be like who in their right mind is ordering this okay it's all ordered welcome to a new segment that i'm like that i'd like to call trying emma's weird childhood food preferences i ordered three of my weird foods that i used to eat they're not weird but the way that i would eat them is weird and i think i'm gonna start with the least weird and go to the most weird i ordered a slice of pizza i would get a slice of cheese pizza and what i would do to it was so [ __ ] up watch i would peel the cheese off and eat it with no cheese i'm not gonna peel all the cheese off because i actually want to eat this later so i'm not gonna ruin the whole thing i would eat pizza with no cheese just crust and sauce because i didn't like melted cheese for some reason it freaked me out because it was all chewy and gooey and all that so let's see how this tastes with no cheese i mean it still tastes good let's try it with the cheese and see if that makes it better it's substantially better with the cheese but it still tastes good without the cheese i'm gonna rate cheese pizza without the cheese a six and a half out of ten because honestly it tastes good i mean it's bread and tomato sauce like you can't go wrong the next weird thing i would eat was fries but i would eat them with mustard i loved burger king fries so i ordered from burger king and i would just eat these with mustard like there was no tomorrow and it was like my favorite thing ever why that is so gross and unnecessary ketchup is so much better french fry mustard let's give it a go it's a very nostalgic flavor and it's really gross listen i love mustard i always have but when i was younger i was like obsessed with mustard like i would eat mustard with a spoon which is clearly an issue i'm going to rate this a 3 out of 10. it's really unpleasant french fries are delicious no matter what you put on them but the mustard just doesn't complement the flavor of the potato at all i i can't believe i would eat that next time you're at a diner and you order fries and there's a little mustard squirter thing try mustard with french fries and just see how wrong it is those two were weird but like not that weird this last weird food i used to eat takes the cake it's my subway sandwich order you will not believe this it's [ __ ] hilarious honestly there's three ingredients in this which is why literally nothing's spilling out the side i'm gonna let you take a guess as to what's inside of this you can kind of see a little something there but it's swiss cheese olives and bell peppers now i know some of you guys are not gonna believe me so i'm gonna call my mom and ask her what my order was to prove to you guys this is not staged to prove to you guys that i used to order this [Music] she keeps declining my call i'm gonna call my dad and see if he knows okay quick question off the top of your head recite my subway sandwich order and don't ask questions just say it okay uh it was just pretty much peppers and green peppers and olives i think slices what did you think about that when i was a child but how did that make you feel about me and how i was developing were you concerned well no i wasn't concerned at all because basically i just thought you know eventually you'll figure it out there we go um honestly okay it's sad it's definitely sad but it smells good like it smells good and honestly like this if this was grilled cheese like if you grilled this it would probably taste really good it's time to try it that's far worse than i remember i actually was excited to eat this i was like this shit's gonna be good i don't know why i was like you know it's definitely a nostalgic flavor it tastes exactly the same as it did you know a few years ago yeah i'm gonna have to give this like a four out of ten it's not as disgusting as fries and mustard that's like really bad to me now like i really don't even think i could eat that as a joke this i could eat like this i could get i could eat it i'm just happy to say that my palate has evolved as an adult and now if i were to get a sandwich i would get hummus in it and a bunch of veggies but that was my [ __ ] as a kid that was my [ __ ] growing up so what are you gonna do so that was fun i probably had more weird [ __ ] that i would eat so if you want this to be a running series let me know i think i'm gonna go get back in bed though bedtime while i'm in bed relaxing i thought i would talk about the sponsor of today's video hack son thank you paxton for sponsoring this video this is crazy to working with paxton has been so cool for me because growing up the first store i would go to in the mall was pacsun without fail every single time and it was the place i went to find the trends to you know load up on literally anything jeans tops like declan so being sponsored by them today is very exciting what i'm newly obsessed with from pacsun is their unisex collection it's basically a line that you can shop in without thinking about gender i shop in the men's section all the time it's a bummer when i find something in the men's section that i like but it doesn't fit my body it's frustrating paxon created the perfect unisex line there's so many different types of pieces tops bottoms outerwear accessories shoes all of the above you don't have to listen to the noise of what you are or aren't supposed to wear this line is created for everybody and i absolutely love that the top i'm wearing is from the unisex collection also i'm obsessed with this this leopard sweater is from the collection my sweatpants are also from pacsun by the way and i wear these way too much working with pacsun is so great because i really appreciate their commitment to being inclusive and they have such a great collection out go check it out links to everything will be in my description also another thing i have to say about pacsun if you've ever seen me wear these shorts i'll be back i wear these so often it should be a crime these are also from pacsun so anyway declan you need to stop you're starting to cause a ruckus i've worn these to death like i'm surprised they're not they don't have stains on them thank you for sponsoring this video paxton i love you so much and send me more pairs of those tie-dye shorts asap because those things are gonna disintegrate soon i just got back from a walk slash jog anyway i have this subway sandwich as a newfound chef i can't just let this go to waste i need to turn it into something now it's a little bit soggy but i'm determined to make this sandwich into my dinner first ingredient i'm determined to add is pesto okay we're gonna add some pesto listen um i refuse to waste this beautiful sandwich i'm trying to make this like upgraded i also am definitely going to be putting this in a pan like it's a grilled cheese because if i didn't that would be a disgrace so let's actually put the pan on the pesto is definitely gonna add a bunch of flavor i also have some sun-dried tomatoes i feel like that could be a nice addition i feel like this is good that's already gonna be a buttload more flavor than it was before like maybe a little bit of salt i don't know i don't know oh should i add hummus to this okay see now i feel like we're doing too much you know what we're just gonna do this it's looking kind of sad though you know what it could be good oh what if i olive oil up the pan oh you know and then it's like more of a panini should i like press it down really hard to kind of make it flatter that could make it taste i don't know i need everything to like warm up and melt so i'm going to do something that i saw in a tick tock once or you go like this and you steam that [ __ ] so i guess we'll leave that for a second it doesn't sound good in there oh my god it melted the cheese now we're gonna take our sammy flip it over oh this looks actually kind of good it's like soaking up all the olive oil wait this might actually be good this is what makes cooking worth it it's moments like this oh white that was a little bit too ironic for my liking sometimes the universe tests me it's not the most attractive thing let's see how i did does she look great absolutely not but does she smell great shockingly yes yo this might be good wait listen to this wait i'm a good cook i'm a good cook because i can make something from nothing we're gonna give it a try guys that's one of the most delicious things i've ever eaten the bread is so crispy but like soaked in olive oil but crispy and like so good the pesto is so good the sun-dried tomatoes so good the olives have a nice kick the pepper is a nice wow i can't believe this i cannot believe how good it is this is why i love cooking this is why i love cooking did i really do anything no subway did everything this was not really me before i go eat this i'm gonna plate it up wait i kind of can't really plate it up properly because i already ate part of it so it doesn't look as pretty but we're gonna plate it regardless this parmesan cheese might be moldy i feel like cheese doesn't really get moldy but there's just like some specks on it but i'm just gonna use a little bit of it anyway if anybody tells you that you can't do things maybe they say emma you'll never be able to well they wouldn't say emma because your name's not emma but let's say somebody says to you you're never gonna be able to cook that's what people said to me and look at me now seriously guys anything's possible i'm gonna go eat [Music] i'm in bed i'm i've clocked out like i'm done you know what i'm saying like i'm done i have transcended into bedtime but anyway i loved hanging out with you guys today i hope you had fun with me if you didn't don't tell me because i will not be able to handle it but anyway um i love you all so much you guys are so awesome follow your dreams be yourself believe in yourself be kind to yourself you know that's something i need people to say to me more i don't know stay off your phone take a break from the internet stop checking your instagram all the time stop checking your tick tuck all the time stop checking checking your text all the time it's bad for you it's really [ __ ] bad for you be kind to yourself and stop going on social media that's my advice that's what i want you to take from this video also go for a walk [ __ ] it go for a walk i don't care if it's cold bundle up go for a walk if you can't go for a walk listen to music i don't know do something me and my cheetah cardigan are out of here you thought i was gonna forget didn't you hell no [Applause] you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-04-08T18:29:33Z,353520,7332303,10304,good morning [Music] good morning look outside it is extremely foggy out and it's my last day in new york i know i'm so sad i literally just woke up so everybody like let me warm up first i don't even know why i turned the camera on at this point because i am not warmed up yet like my brain is still um a sleepy it's a foggy day which is my [ __ ] favorite i love the fog so we have to make today epic because it's my last day and then i have to go back to la i'm heartbroken i don't want to go back to la ever ever i need to make today epic but i'm like how do i do that the problem is i made it a goal on this trip not to go on my phone a lot and not to go shopping that was a crazy goal because those are the only two things i do so i haven't done shopping at all successfully i've been here for like five days and i've not gone shopping once so that's extremely impressive i do need coffee so i'm thinking i may need to walk somewhere and get coffee i'm not hungry for coffee as you can see i ordered a coffee last night and i didn't end up drinking it because i was like oh wait it's 7 p.m what am i doing good morning new york i'm trying a new coffee shop today i'm so tired i always say that i don't rely on caffeine i'm like no i'm immune i don't need it anymore but it's like mornings like these where i'm sprinting out of the house just to get a little bit of energy that i remember that maybe i am severely reliant on caffeine but do you know what i'm okay with that i'm okay with that it's freezing out it's 40 degrees honestly i'm getting used to the cold weather i'd moved to new york if i could there's just too many reasons why i shouldn't but i really would if i could i would one day okay update the place i was gonna go is closed i'm gonna take this as a sign that i need to go on an adventure and i'm going to just walk until i find a coffee shop that sucks because this was like a cool little italian cafe i was like damn that's going to be sick but no [Music] have a good one i literally only had to walk like two steps so oh that shit's hot mmm it's a delicious latte though see sometimes the universe guides you in a different direction than you would have planned you might have been like i really want to try out this coffee shop but then the universe says no you're going to walk down the street get coffee somewhere else and you're gonna love it you just have to trust the universe i definitely look like a freak right now holding my camera up like this but no regrets any of you that know me is like emma a hot coffee once a day you freak that is so unlike you it is it is unlike me but the truth of the matter is i am evolving i'm as a woman i'm growing up enjoying hot coffee is just one part of my development trying to figure out what i want to do i think i might go for like a little walk until i get tired tired [Music] just did a little scroll through scroll oh my god i've been on my phone too much just did a little stroll not scroll because we're not on an iphone just did a little stroll through little italy little italy is like a little italy nothing was open unfortunately so i couldn't get like a cannoli i saw a big cannoli shop and i was like but it was closed so maybe later but regardless very nice i'm ready to go back to my room because i drank my coffee and now i'm starting to feel like things are rumbling in my tumbly and i'm also kind of considering do i get another coffee on the way home i'm crazy i think i'm gonna get another coffee we'll see where i stop they say that new york is a city that never sleeps wow what amazing points were made from this clip god bless you all anything to eat today um no thank you cool do you need a tray yes is this a robot or a real person what's that oh you're a real person got it i'm a real person oh it's you yes yes oh [ __ ] that's cool update i got two more coffees because i'm gonna put one in my little mini fridge so coffee prepping is important oh my god this dude is cleaning a window on the most suspicious ladder i've ever seen anyway i'm back in the room i tend to have this struggle when i go to coffee shops where i don't know if i want a cold brew or latte because i like both i like cold brew i like lattes i'm open-minded right as long as it's not like okay i'm not open-minded there's definitely some things on on coffee menus that i won't touch just because i'm a snob about coffee i am i don't know who i don't know when my brain well it makes sense it's on brent so i ordered a latte and a cold brew and we're gonna try both and see which one i'm gonna drink first okay latte's pretty good but it's very milky cold brew i like the cold brew better today all right so what are we doing today please don't look at that mess there's a few decisions that need to be made number one do i want to get fitted up and by fitted up i mean do i want to get on a crazy outfit and like get dressed and like do the whole thing that's question number one question number two is do i want to go shopping it's my last day i can't make too much damage on my last day i definitely can do i want to just go for a walk again hmm i haven't gone into one thrift store and you're probably like emma are you even the same person we don't recognize you you're you know not going into thrift stores you're getting a hot coffee in the morning what the [ __ ] is wrong with you well there's actually a lot of things wrong with me but they're unrelated to the problem at hand i don't know i'm trying to not shop and because well thrifting is not really shopping the main issue is that i don't have room to take anything home in the plane my suitcase is packed to the brim baby like we are not fitting anything in there but we're gonna have to figure something out i might go to a thrift store today i don't know okay just like one wouldn't hurt i can control myself okay i can this is my strategy my strategy is just to never go in in the first place because if i go into the thrift store or i go into the vintage store or i go into the store in general i'm gonna see a piece right and i'm gonna be like i will never see this piece again because it's one of a kind i'm never gonna find it again if i don't buy it now somebody else will buy it it'll be in their closet and it won't be in mine and i can't let that happen and now it's like i just have more [ __ ] and i have a lot of [ __ ] so i'm trying not to shop and i'm trying to control myself but i may go to a vintage store today also it's my last day should probably look relatively badass when i'm walking around like relatively it doesn't need to be like perfect but i'm kind of running out of clothes this is like the first time i've been on a trip and worn everything that i brought i'm actually impressed you know what celebrate your successes and i'm i'm celebrating mine because i didn't over pack this trip although i did bring a suitcase away 70 pounds you know how they say that the water in new york is what makes bagels and pizza taste better here number one i think i agree i mean i have no evidence to back it up the bagels in the pizza here do taste better but it might just be placebo so who knows but i think there is something magical in the water in new york because my skin looks way better than normal nothing about my routine changes just being somewhere else don't know what that's all about but i did decide i'm gonna get ready it's my last day here i want to feel like a baddie is that too much to ask no the only thing is right now my hair it's sad i didn't appreciate my hair enough when it was healthy now my hair is very unhealthy and breaking off by the day i mean things are just breaking off like my hair is just breaking off it's not falling out which is good but it's breaking off so it's like all the ends are breaking off at first i was really bummed out about this i was like wow this is a bummer who cares in the grand scheme of life who cares and now that's where i've ended up and it it's really true it's like it really doesn't matter and it'll grow back and who cares and even if it didn't grow back who cares my makeup routine never changes like i find a makeup routine and i do it for six years it's no joke you know what else is interesting when i first got here okay i live in california it rarely goes below 60 degrees it definitely does but it's not common and on those days well i just don't go outside it's been like between 30 and 50 degrees since i've gotten here and i mean 30 degrees is freezing that's the freezing point fun fact so it's been very cold but over the course of this trip i've gotten more used to it and now i understand why it's possible that people like get used to cold weather and then they don't have to wear like as thick of clothes definitely interesting and that makes me wonder is the body's like feeling of pain from cold weather mental or physical mainly like is it mainly mental there must be a mental element to it that's more than physical when it comes to temperature because you think of people that like climb mount everest that's probably like what negative 50 degrees up there who knows i don't know and they get used to it right because they like are constantly climbing cold hills cold mountains whatever anyway recently i've been feeling like a scientist coming up with hypotheses talking about important things the water in new york is different and the weather is adaptable by humans everybody's like emma just go to college and shut up let me have my fun let me have my fun i'm not actually gonna take the time to google what's the difference between the water in la and in new york like no of course i'm not going to google it you think i have all that time on my hands i do i do have all that time on my hands but i'm still not going to look it up how [ __ ] okay i'm done i'm ready for the day but now it's like what do we do with the day when in doubt lay in bed and think seriously guys this stuff is underrated oh my god i also didn't mention this so i'm flying home tomorrow at 4am guess what that means i'm pulling an all-nighter i have to have a lot of coffee today so we're just like loading up now i'm already on my second one it's like 10 in the morning i give no [ __ ] i'm so i'm so i'm such like a free spirit i'm so wild i'm so reckless you know after much contemplation i've decided i'm going to go on my daily walk and i'm gonna get lunch um i'm not allowing myself to go shopping i know but i know this is good for me i know we all want shopping emma but shopping emma needs a break okay she is self-destructive and dangerous um i also decided to get into a boring outfit you know what it's my last day in new york i just want to absorb and enjoy the environment i'm gonna go find food somewhere hey would you guys call me crazy if i got a coffee again well i have bad news or maybe good i'm getting another coffee i'm sorry i can't i can't not do it i'm unstoppable oh wow oh i just spelled some of it i'm gonna sit i don't even know where i am like what even is this i'm gonna sit on this concrete thing drink my coffee and then i'm gonna go for my daily walk i'm gonna try to get in as many steps as i can my goal every day has been ten thousand steps i've hit that three out of the four days i've been here so far but i'm trying to go for gold today maybe even 20 000 steps you know what maybe i'll go thrifting i know i know i said i wasn't going to do it but i kind of want to right now i kind of just want to go shopping [Music] i don't think i've ever walked this much in my life i love it i don't think anybody is surprised that i'm now at a thrift store i have lip sweat right now because i've been walking for four miles for no reason i just walked four miles i walked literally to the empire state building and back and i need to go home i'm sweating my ass off i'm sweating my ass off it's so hot it's 62 degrees but i feel like i'm dying holy [ __ ] i'm back in the room oh my god i'm so tired i walked four and a half miles listen my body's not made for this okay i live in la i walk probably a mile in total every day i drive my car that's it and so walking four and a half miles um i feel like my body's disintegrating did i buy a few things at the thrift store yes number one about two things first i got this little shoulder bag it's just so cute i'll probably never wear it knowing me no i'm just kidding i probably will but look how cute oh my god i spent a lot of money on that okay i will be using it next i got this jacket it's so boring i mean it's not boring like it's cute but it's like not like i got some sort of like crazy statement piece like this is very much a closet staple oh wait i love this though oh that's so cute okay great this worked out i got one more thing so on the way home i was like oh my god i'm so dehydrated from walking four and a half miles i'm gonna go get a juice so i got celery juice because for some reason i thought it would be refreshing well it tastes like ass i doubt this even does anything for you either you might as well eat celery it tastes bad but it like weirdly has a flavor that's like addicting it's like when people always talk about when they fart and then they smell it and they're like i hate the smell but i'm coming back for seconds for some reason ew i'm feeling wrecked to the core for dinner tonight i think i'm gonna do either a reservation for one or a room service bash oh my god it's not even three it's 2 45. okay well i'm not walking anymore should i watch a movie oh that sounds amazing but it's also like it's my last day emma stop you can't [ __ ] lay in bed and watch your movie on your last day in new york city watch me get copyrighted for that because i hit the note so well i hit that note so well i can't drink any more coffee either because i am on one how many have i had let's do a coffee counter oh that shit's hot update i got two more coffees that's a delicious latte though oh wait i've only had three because i didn't drink one one of the ones i got was not good what if i went out and get another one i just took my shoes off but i kind of want another one do you want to see my bald spot hi it's emma from the future here you can't see the bald spot but that's because there's it's not really a bald spot it's more like my hair is just falling out and breaking off but um you can't see it so you're just gonna have to take my word for it all right see you that's a psa not to bleach your hair i think i'm gonna should i go get another i don't know also is this a cute hairstyle for me don't answer that i don't wanna i don't wanna know okay you guys are gonna think i'm crazy when i first got here i went grocery shopping and i bought some snacks i feel like i need to burn through some of them because i'm gonna have to throw them away tomorrow when i leave i bought some vegan yogurt and i have some granola so i'm thinking i could make a little parfait do i even have a spoon oh my god i don't think i have a spoon okay we'll cross that bridge when we get to it well i could drink it is it weird to drink it yum but how the [ __ ] am i gonna eat it oh i found a fork i found a fork i know that i said i was gonna go get coffee maybe but my bed just feels so good so i'm just gonna eat my yogurt i love vegan yogurt i think i love it it's kind of bad but there's definitely something weird about the flavor but i still go come back for more you know i can't get out of bed i can't but i need to do i need to no okay do you know what i i came on here to be like i'm gonna go out and i'm gonna go get a coffee no i'm not what is that that's my heating pad the second the heating pad turns on i'm not getting out of bed for at least another hour give me an hour we'll see what i end up doing i am so tired to be honest i laid in bed for the rest of the day i know i'm upset because i needed i wanted to explore a little bit more on my last day but no no i was tired i'm done i'm done i did so much walking this week i saw so many things i'm done so guess what we're doing now room service [ __ ] we're gonna go all in except not really because i'm a vegetarian who has stomach issues so i have like three options on the menu can i have a almond milk latte brussels sprouts and the tri-color salad thank you oh [ __ ] i forgot to order hot water so i want to make tea because my tummy hurts all the time god this sweater makes my neck look crazy what's going on there ew you didn't see anything that was weird um we're gonna do a mukbang i'm hungry but i'm not that hungry so i think i'm gonna have a midnight snack and post something pose made something later but this is like a good intro to dinner you know what i mean but i'm getting a coffee because i have to stay up all night because i'm flying home at like six in the morning so i'm just gonna pull an all-nighter instead of trying to go to bed tonight because like what the [ __ ] the point of that hopefully the coffee keeps me awake although sometimes i feel like coffee makes me more tired so i don't really know what to do anymore why am i so tired why why look at my shirt it's funny it's time to take the makeup off like i i tried to convince myself that maybe i'd go out again uh no i'm done it's just not gonna happen to be honest i'm very sad that i'm leaving i'm not ready you know sometimes you leave a trip and you're like yeah no i'm ready like this is i'm done i thought that i was going to be here for long enough i was here for so long i was here for like five days six days you'd think that's enough to get sick of it but no i'm not sick of it whatever i'll be back that's like such a mom thing to say oh honey it's okay we'll be back you know okay i'm like i'm i swear to god the [ __ ] that i say to myself my own head is like what my parents used to say to me like when you're leaving disneyland and you're like five and you're like mommy i don't ever want to leave this is the best place ever and then your mom's like oh we'll be back come on that's me right now my food is here this is not what i was expecting i was expecting a much larger salad alas we're gonna enjoy it needed anyway i don't even like tomatoes but i'm going to eat them because i feel like that's pretty much the only part of the salad that there is and i don't like tomatoes i mean it's the best tomato i've ever had i feel like if you get like a nice good quality tomato it it's different like it's better i wanted to recap this trip because i went on this trip by myself to just relax spend time with me get off my phone get off social media and i've done this before i remember a few months ago i did a video where i did kind of a similar thing where i went and i stayed at a hotel by myself for the night and did like a little one-night trip and i had a terrible time my anxiety was bad i had an awful time i think the main reason why i had an awful time was because i was still in la i literally just went and stayed in a hotel in la but i didn't really get anything out of that but this trip this solo trip by myself i got a lot out of it number one it gave me a different perspective you know i'm constantly listening to what people in my life are saying about what i'm doing and so i feel like i was really thinking for myself this week which i don't normally do another thing it gives you time to think about how you want to make your life better when you get home i realized so many things about my life because i had all this free time to just reflect on my life in general which i never get the chance to do that just made me realize like what kind of changes i want to make in my life that was great i can't believe i'm eating tomatoes right now i hate them i also got a hot latte which is again oh my god i started drinking hot lattes on this trip now i order hot lattes because i like them can you believe that they put apples they put apples in the brussels sprouts why does that taste good that should not taste good it's bizarre but it tastes good i need to learn to chew my food all the way through i swallow my food when it's halfway chewed and it's just like how i've been my whole life and i literally think that's the root of 90 of my stomach issues look what i got brownie let's try it very good i'm i'm sad right now um i'm sad right now because i don't want to leave i don't want to leave new york i don't want to pack okay this lighting is so bad is that better you know sometimes things are going to be bittersweet and that is how i feel about leaving new york i really don't want to leave but i have to i have to get back home see my cats that's the only thing i'm looking forward to but listen i had a great trip i had many revelations i had many moments of insight i had many moments of joy many moments of positivity but i'm glad i got to hang out with you guys throughout my trip and i hope you guys enjoyed hanging out with me i did another new york vlog so if you didn't see that go check it out it's on my channel you know where to go and i think that's pretty much all i got i need to start packing now and then i'm probably gonna watch some dumb [ __ ] on netflix and then i'm probably gonna eat these and then that's gonna be it anyway here's your forehead kiss i love you guys so much sorry if i seem like i'm in a bad mood it's because i am it's because i am because i don't want to leave i don't want to leave okay here's one more forward kiss i love you guys so much thank you for hanging out with me and uh give this video a thumbs up if you want me to come back to new york i love when youtubers are like give this video a thumbs up if you want me to dye my hair you really think people care about your hair that much to a point where they're gonna like the video just because they want you to do something that only affects you the psychology of youtubers is insane oh my god i should do a podcast episode about that subscribe to anything goes my podcast okay i'm done i'm done one more guess okay i'm done bye guys

-emma chamberlain",2021-04-04T17:23:09Z,470707,8938628,17028,good morning [Music] guys this is not my bed i'm in a hotel room and i'm in new york can you believe it emma got out of l.a i decided to do a little solo trip just enjoy a new scenery kind of shock my system in a way i guess so i'm here i'm here i've been here for 24 hours but we're here the window is very dirty so you can't really see anything but i'm in new york and there's the proof so i'm not gonna waste any time it's eight in the morning i'm gonna get started with my day right now normally i lay in bed for hours but no not when i'm in new york when i'm in new york i have some sort of fire under my ass that i don't have otherwise to give you a little weather forecast it's about 35 degrees right now and the warmest it's going to be today is probably around 55. um so it's freezing which means i've been wearing leggings under my pants 10 shirts puffer jackets i mean i've been freezing we're gonna go out and do a few morning errands so we're gonna get coffee a bagel because i'm in new york another weird thing that i'm going to preface you guys on before we go out and do the coffee and bagel thing um if you guys know me you know that i only drink iced coffee but it's been so cold here that i've been drinking hot coffee so i'm just kind of putting a warning out there like don't think that i've changed it's just it's cold out and i'm enjoying it but what the crazy part is hot lattes are way better than i thought i don't think i drink a hot coffee if it wasn't 40 degrees or below but regardless this is the new me new york has already changed me anyway let's get ready the key to staying warm in this kind of weather is layering i didn't grow up in cold weather i grew up in california where it's like never below 50. i'm wearing leggings under my sweatpants i'm going to wear a scarf i'm going to wear gloves no i'm not because that's actually going to be a normal puffer jacket with the hood it honestly takes forever like when i'm in la i take it for granted i take the warmth in la for granted because i just can walk outside and chances are the temperature will not harm me but being in new york you have to prepare and like that is something i'm not used to ready to go it's bagel and coffee time let's do it you know i feel like it's a lot easier to vlog in new york than it is in la because nobody gives a [ __ ] here everybody gives a [ __ ] in l.a but here i can hold my camera with pride it's actually not that cold this morning i thought it was going to be colder i feel good then again i am extremely bundled up so if i didn't feel good then there'd be probably something wrong with my body i like how it's a walking city like you have to walk to get to places because it makes me adventure a little bit more he okay i'm not gonna lie to you guys i just got lost for like 15 minutes because for some reason the google maps in new york are not always the most accurate so it'll take you weird streets and then you just end up getting lost and then it'll keep rerouting you and rerouting you to try to help you get to your destination but it's not helping it's actually just making it worse yeah but we're fine let's try the bagel everything bagel with cream cheese yeah yeah you can make anything happen if you got your heart done right i'm about to follow you right now thank you well it's nice to meet you nice to meet you look at me being social there's not i don't i don't think there's a better food on this planet i got a hot latte i don't know what's wrong with me i'm changing i'm evolving but it tastes so good it's just amazing my bagel guys i forgot how [ __ ] good they are dude i don't even know how it's possible like i've never tasted something better in my life it's like my favorite food and i literally they hurt my stomach so bad they make my stomach hurt worse than anything in the world i don't even care the only problem with hot coffee is that i finish it in like three seconds like i drink iced coffee slower but i mean whatever you can't win either way see it's only 9am and i've already gotten my coffee and had my bagel that i'm i want another bagel god that bagel was so good hi um can i order an iced latte with almond milk an ice bucket and boiling water i'm gonna make tea because my stomach is already hurting from the bagel now listen was it worth it [ __ ] yes it was worth it not to mention i took like 50 photos of it i literally took guys i mean we're talking like i took photos of this [ __ ] i even posed it i posed it look i posed it in two different ways that's not normal that is not normal to take your bagel and be like moving it around for the perfect photo but guess what i did that because i want the world to see how gorgeous look how [ __ ] gorgeous if my stomach feels like [ __ ] a lot [ __ ] it let's try this out god the lighting in this room is [ __ ] terrible let's try the coffee first did i say almond milk i always get scared because okay especially after all that cream cheese i just ate i'm like if i have another drop of dairy in my system i don't know what's gonna happen pretty good we also need to make tea so so you guys may think i'm crazy i brought my own tea bags from home i feel like my mom this is something my mom used to do when we go on trips she would bring like her own tea bags and her own coffee creamer and stuff like that cause she just has preferences and she knows what she likes but now i'm becoming her also yesterday i went to the grocery store and bought lemon juice so that i could put it in my tea because i like to put a lot of lemon in my tea and whenever you ask for a lemon wedge they never give you enough so i just went to the store and bought lemon juice which is also psychotic making my tea look how gorgeous it looks all i do is think about taking photos of things it's like kind of a disease i feel like my tea and my coffee looks so pretty that i want to take a photo of them right here like look how gorgeous but it's like why am i thinking about taking a photo of it like why am i not just thinking about existing i'm posing this so that it looks good for my instagram i need some sort of do you know what i hate myself but it looks gorgeous okay i'm done that was [ __ ] enough it's like just drink your stupid tea and drink your coffee don't take photos of it stupid idiot i am stupid idiot i am anyway i need a shower because i haven't showered since i've gotten here and i smell like [ __ ] time to get ready while we get ready today we're gonna have a talk we're going to have a talk about something you guys aren't in trouble but we're having a talk no i'm just kidding also i'm using this while i'm on this trip i decided i don't want to go on social media at all obviously it's easier said than done it's such an automatic response right i'm trying to not do that while i'm on this trip and i'm not posting on social media i'm just going to simply exist i am posting on youtube but that's different because youtube's like not toxic it can be but not for me right now i'm realizing that i'm wasting a lot of time being a human requires laying in bed it requires relaxing and i know that but i just don't think that being on social media as much as i am is a good use of my relaxation time but i have an added layer of complication because this is my passion i love making videos i love posting instagram photos this is like what i love to do i also need to have some balance because clearly i don't have any of that so while i'm on this trip i'm trying to enjoy outdoors i'm trying to go on walks i'm trying to just hang out with myself and enjoy that i've also been watching all these documentaries and stuff like that about why social media is so addicting and i know it's such a stupid topic because everybody's like shut up like we get it already like every time i hear people talking about social media in general i'm like this is such a stale topic like can we move on but it's really not a stale topic because it's worse than ever you have to like interact with so many more people than you normally would on the internet whereas like on a day to day at school you might only pass them in the halls once but it's like exhausting to be like seeing what jeremy from math is doing all the time also another interesting thing i think i have a lazy eye and i know it's probably already been apparent in this video because i keep getting comments being like one of her eyes is wonky i know but i don't know how it happened i don't think i have a lazy eye but one of my eyes is a little crooked i don't know it's not all the time it's just when i'm tired which i'm tired a lot let's put on a lip plumper lip plumper is a godsend it just makes my lips look juicy and that's something that i crave i'm by myself i barely talk to anybody since i've gotten here so i might be losing it and that's part of it that's part of the fun that's part of the fun it's like is emma gonna lose it on this trip probably not actually i feel way more emotionally stable here right now than i did when i was at home so i'm just riding this wave and enjoying it it's hard for me not to move out of la at least once a week i really hate it right now and i really want to move the only reason why i'm not moving is because that's where literally the three people i talk to live i feel like i'm forgetting something i look weird also i don't know why i'm like putting lip gloss on just to put a mask on in public like nobody's going to see the effort i'm putting into my lip right now like i just did lip liner i just did lip liner to wear a mask explain that one i have nobody to take a photo of me so i'm having to use timer cam like i took photos in my hotel room yesterday and let me tell you was it awkward my worst nightmare is people knowing that i took a photo on self-timer so i'm always trying to prop it up in an angle where nobody would know oh [ __ ] also i'm not gonna lie my stomach is killing me from that bagel but it was so worth it let's see how i get this off without ruining my makeup oh it's not going well i didn't want to tell you guys what i just did and that's why i didn't film it but now i feel like i'm lying i just spent an hour trying to get an instagram photo because i was like okay this little corner of my hotel room is so cute like i want an instagram photo in it so i got in an outfit that i would never wear outside especially in this weather because it's too cold i'm wearing this cute little mesh top this little vest i'm wearing a skirt little does everybody know i'm wearing leggings underneath i literally set up a tripod using a lamp and a trash can flipped over let me show you i spent an hour on this it wasn't easy but i did get an outfit photo but look okay look in the photo right you look on the wall there's no thermostat i i got this app not sponsored retouch okay and if you want to just randomly like remove something from your photo like something small like this it works like magic let me show you click on this thing that says object removal right you zoom in and then you go like this and you color it in right then you press go it's gone this is why the internet is fake you see how easy it is for me to alter this photo and make it what i want i can remove a full thermostat out of my photo in five seconds the internet is not real now i need to get into an actual outfit that's warm enough to wear because this is not warm enough to wear and then we're going to go out for the day this is what we're wearing now outfit of the day so we're bringing around this bag cute and then we have some fingerless gloves because it's not as cold today but they look badass i tried to use this as a prop in my photo and it ended up looking so corny i was like the one priority for going out today is getting coffee maybe doing a little shopping and then at some point i'm probably gonna get lunch even though my stomach feels like it has an entire three pound bag of rocks in it because um my stomach can pretty much only digest simple things such as i don't even know anymore actually can i do a latte with almond milk i'm walking to get a second coffee coffee 10 times a day stop me can i do a latte with almond milk absolutely not the best day girl i'm just walking around i'm not even going into stores i'm not going in anywhere i'm just walking around and absorbing the atmosphere and i'm probably gonna do this for another hour or two literally just walk you can't do that in la you can't just walk in la like there's nothing to see but in new york you can just keep walking and keep walking and it never gets old hi i'm back from my walk it was unbelievable i just kept walking i loved every second of it but i'm hungry so we need to figure out where to get lunch slash early dinner it's like a liner i saw all these cute restaurants that have outdoor seating but you need to make a reservation so i was like you know what i'm gonna go back to the room change into something a little bit less sweaty and make a reservation somewhere table for one baby okay let's see i don't know where to go table for one i love selecting table for one because it's not only a little bit scary and uncomfortable for me but also it's kind of badass god okay after literally looking for 20 minutes like i could not make a decision i made a decision and i found a restaurant and i made a reservation for 25 minutes from now i'm going to get into an outfit oh my god i'm so hungry am i ready to eat i literally planned like 10 outfits for this trip and i'm not wearing any of them i don't know why i think that like planning an outfit is gonna end up working out like i never end up wearing it this is what i want to wear right now i'm comfortable and i feel good and my hair is dirty and that's where i'm wearing a beanie because my hair is so dirty that it's embarrassing so yeah we have our mask camera battery room key i'm out of here i'm still hungry so i'm gonna order dinner literally in 45 minutes probably because i thought like i ordered things and i like thought that they were gonna be like larger portions and then they weren't and then i was like wait what the [ __ ] like they literally gave me two little dollops of hummus and i paid like 13 so i never realized how long it really takes for food to come because normally when i go out to eat i'm going out to eat with people but that period of time when you're waiting for your food to be prepared is a lot more excruciating by yourself anyway oh my god i look like my high school crush right now so we're gonna put the best back on so i went to cbs on the way home let's do a haul first thing i bought advil number two i got a heating pad because i okay so you guys what you don't understand is i have an addiction to heating pads and i didn't bring one on this trip because i just like didn't even think about it but then last night i was like sad falling asleep without my heating pad because basically my sleeping strategy is that i like to turn the ac to like 65 degrees so it's like freezing cold and then i like to warm up with a heating pad it's like doesn't make any sense but it helps me fall asleep for some reason the heating pad regulates my body temperature much better i don't i don't get it i don't get it i don't know what else to do today i kind of want to go for another walk let's see how many steps i've walked today on the little apple thing damn i did 13 000 steps today in new york city i don't really know what that means though well it's a lot better than last week because according to this last week i only took 2 000 steps walking makes me feel good it's like the best form of exercise too cause it's like fun it's relaxing it's nice i need to start walking more honestly i wish i could move to new york i'm loving new york so much i really wish i could move here it [ __ ] makes me upset but i know that i can't because i know that i'd hate it if i moved here and i don't ever want to ruin it for myself but i also know and i want to live here but i know i do it okay i'm gonna go on a walk and i'll be back i'm back i walked for probably an hour and a half and then i waited for food for about a half hour because i ordered food haul time salad which looks [ __ ] amazing i ordered a pizza but why is it in here okay and then i ordered a pizza with vegan cheese um i'm not a big fan of it but i'm still going to eat it because i bought it so my god guys i just checked my phone and i walked 20 000 miles no wait no not 20 000 steps today salad salad's good hi i have some iced herbal tea it is good anyway that was a day with me in new york i had so much fun today and i never say that which is actually so sad but i like rarely have fun anymore but i had so much fun i was walking around i was exploring i just had a great time i hope you guys had fun hanging out with me today if you did i'm glad i was gonna say if you did give it a thumbs up and i was like emma shut the [ __ ] up by the way i'm laying on my heating pad right now that i bought from cvs earlier check it out check it out thank you guys again for hanging out with me i hope that you had fun and i love you guys and i actually met some of you guys today i met quite a few of you guys today out in the streets of new york and it really made my day so i appreciate you if you ever come up to me it makes me feel very good and you guys are always so sweet that's all i got to say i'll see you later i'll see you later see you around comment down below um a reason why i shouldn't move to new york because it's getting really tempting for me but i know it's a bad idea like i know it's a bad idea i know it's a bad idea but so everybody comment down below one reason why i shouldn't move here to convince me out of moving here i love you guys here's your forehead kiss you guys didn't think i forgot did you

-emma chamberlain",2021-03-28T19:03:09Z,223100,3621860,6979,[Music] i've learned nothing new do i know anything interesting [ __ ] it [ __ ] it good morning oh wait hi everybody what up what's on the agenda today you may ask um today i am packing for my first trip in many months many months i'm going on my first fun trip of 2021. do i leave tomorrow oh my god i [ __ ] leave tomorrow i leave tomorrow i'm going to no wait i can't sing because i will get copyrighted i'm going to new york by myself i'm going to new york by myself because number one i just need to get out of la i've been in la for months and i've been just complaining about how much i hate it here and i've decided i'm done whining and i'm going to just do something about it so i'm very excited but today i need to prepare there's an obvious place that i need to go and that is target yep target because i need to get one of those cosmetic bags so that you can carry all your stuff mine broke probably a year ago i'm a little bit nervous because going on a trip by yourself is kind of scary because you're like am i going to get bored am i going to get sad am i going to get home sick you know there's questions that you ask but i think it'll be fun one of the things i'm the most excited about is going to dinner by myself i'm so excited to call a nice restaurant and be like hey table for one and they're gonna be like who's coming for table for one this must be some sort of independent ceo of uber or something like they're gonna think when somebody gets a table for one it's like it screams sophistication and then my little 19 year old ass is gonna walk in there and they're gonna be like are you sure you're the table for one i'm gonna say yes [ __ ] and suck on it my coffee looks shockingly milky today i i promise it doesn't taste that milky but it looks so milky it's upsetting it's like super not on brand you know what time it is time for me to make myself look presentable enough to go in public so we're going to do the bare minimum yeah i'm not even going to brush my teeth i don't care didn't realize the camera was still on part of me is like emma just wear the yoga pants that you wore yesterday but they're so disgusting because i wore them all day yesterday so maybe i'll wear jeans that sucks when i bought this big snuggie thing i thought it was funny i thought it was a joke and i thought that i was never gonna wear it but my god was i wrong i wear this thing all the time earring ch i've been loving hoops recently because like they weirdly frame your face in a way like it makes you look put together when you're not it's my new favorite life hack i'm wearing my current favorite sleep shirt my paul mccartney my vintage paul mccartney tea um and i get it emotionally attached to t-shirts and or shorts that i wear to bed and i start just wearing them to bed every single night without fail okay so what do i want to wear okay i'm definitely just gonna wear this paul mccartney shirt under whatever i wear ignore my hair look at my gorgeous hair guys my hair is literally so broken don't ever go blonde don't just don't go blonde don't do what i did and go get it bleached all in one day and then irreversibly damage your hair because that's what i did it's a singing day for me i'm gonna wear this nice big navy hoodie that's step one done step one of the outfit next i'm going to brush through my hair with my fingers and then i'm gonna clip it listen we're just going to target it's like who am i going also we're going to target at nine in the morning it's like nine a.m right now so it's not like there's gonna be anybody who's gonna judge me there you know i feel like the people that judge are like teenagers like fellow teenagers they're the ones that judge but i'm just gonna be hanging out with the moms right now so i feel safe going like this and then for pam [ __ ] what is going on with me i'm having a very big music day okay listen i'm not comfortable i'm wearing jeans i'm not my most comfy right now maybe if i do a little squat you know what they say if you like squat in your jeans it'll like loosen them up or something i think that actually kind of helped that actually kind of did help god why have i not been doing that my whole life tutorial time okay if your jeans are feeling too tight go like this drop it low and just kind of and then your jeans won't be as tight i know that that's like common knowledge but apparently i didn't know it enough so now i know i'm gonna take my dirty socks from yesterday okay i just bought a new controversial uh birkenstock and i'd like to share so i bought these and you're probably like emma what the [ __ ] i was not fully convinced that i would like these but i saw multiple people in them and wearing them that i admire i didn't come up with this idea on my own but i saw multiple people that i really liked their style wearing these and i was like are they really that bad then i thought about it and i was like yeah they probably are bad but sometimes i'm a sheep just like everybody else and so i bought them but i also think that they align very well with my fashion philosophy which is sometimes wearing ugly [ __ ] and making it look cute is the most gratifying feeling you can get when you're doing fashion and when you're wearing fashion although i'm not wearing a fashionable outfit right now i look like a vegan right now i look hella vegan in this outfit okay so i have a little dilemma normally i'd bring an iced coffee with me to target but it's literally 45 degrees outside and that's a little bit too cold for me to function therefore i'm not bringing a coffee i'm gonna make one when i get home because i just don't want to be walking around with a freezing cold drink when it's like that cold out it's like too cold to be walking around with a nice coffee right now i'm on my way i think the best time to go to target is early in the morning because that's when the least people are there and listen i'm not trying to wait in a long line ever i'm not trying to make my life more difficult than it needs to be ever also i don't know which target i want to go to i'm making a rash decision and i'm going to the target that's farther away from me why because to be honest i forgot how to get to the other target that's closer to me you know what i think sometimes makes me feel bad or not makes me feel bad but sometimes i think about it right sometimes i think about how my god like on my instagram i am dressing up to the nine i'm wearing [ __ ] that i rarely ever wear in public unless there was some sort of specific event yeah whenever i go to the store or i you know i'm hanging out with friends most likely i am wearing jeans a hoodie in some sort of controversial birkenstock and or ugg boot that begs the question is my fashion sense based on what you wear most often or what you wear when you're feeling creative so that's a question i've been asking myself um not that the answer really matters more importantly i got my nails done yesterday i sent a picture to my mom of my nails and she told me they reminded her of a grandma during christmas time um so if you block out the fact that my face looks like a 12 year old do i look like i have grandma around christmastime hands i like them i think that they're kind of cool but my mom likes to challenge me [Music] okay i'm done in target and guess what i got everything except for what i needed and isn't that always how that works i needed one of those toiletry cases that like you can put all your toiletries in you know what i'm talking about the ones that like you unzip and then they unfold and they have all these pockets for toiletries well they didn't have that so instead i got boring stuff but i present to you target haul i got parchment paper two of them foil pyrex containers for storing leftovers turning into a mom literally more and more every day okay this is kind of handy i got these little travel container this little travel container set because all of mine are really old and very much used i got mini toothpaste although these don't seem many to me but they're in the travel section which implies that they're mini and i like many things i got tea and last but not least i got a mini deodorant to throw in my carry-on because you never know when you might need a little refresh in the airport that's my target haul oh wait no and i got a hand sanitizer for my carry-on so that was super fun right breakfast time wanna see what my breakfast is today you guys aren't gonna believe this a pizza i made last night at 10 p.m and then forgot about it and went to sleep i am not even going to warm it up honestly because i think sometimes cold pizza is really good i'm just going to sprinkle some nutritional yeast on top or maybe a lot of nutritional use nutritional yeast is literally the most confusing food to explain it's kind of cheesy but it's also not cheesy at all let's try my overnight pizza you know what this might actually taste better cold than it does warm because i just swallowed a mini ice cube and it [ __ ] hurt me so i'm stressed because i need to get this toiletry case but do i really let me show you what a toiletry case is you see it holds all your toiletries whatever yes i feel like i need that but i'm weighing my pros and cons here what's worse having to go to another store to find one or just trying to find something i already own that will work equally as well just maybe in a less traditional sense i'm leaning towards the second option as of now because i really don't have the energy to go out again i do think i should start packing because i like to pack like a good 24 hours in advance just in case so let's start packing [Music] that didn't sound good that didn't sound good either obviously i need to bring my basic stuff pajamas toiletries blah blah but i'm going to pack based on outfits because i'm going to be there for what four or five days and i want to look cooler than i've ever looked before in my entire life every single day of the trip i want to take risk risks with my fashion i'm going to spend the next hour do you not know we're going to do that last we're going to pick out outfits last let's pack the easy stuff first so first we're packing toiletries this is all i can find and this is far too small but i'm going to try to make it work first let's pack skin care which leads us to the sponsor of today's video bad habit skin care you guys know i love them i'm their global brand ambassador and their creative director one product i'm gonna make sure is in my bag for this trip is the bad habit eyes open caffeine and peptide eye cream here's why it's very good for those under eye bags and i've had under eye bags my whole life because they are genetic the caffeine and peptides in this reduce the appearance of dark circles and the puffiness marine algae and illuminating pigments light up your under eyes and make your under eyes look instantly less dull mango butter and oat extract make the eyes feel soothed and gorgeous it's vegan it's 19 it is a fave for me as you can see i applied this a few seconds ago and it's already kind of brightening my under eyes i'm packing her i'm packing the hemp oil the facial oil because that's a need silent mode hydrating mask is going in because my skin is going to be really dry from the traveling and i'm going to need a nice hydrating mask multivitamin daily dose moisturizer melatonin glycolic night cream toothbrush toothpaste deodorant you can now buy the products off of badhabitbeauty.com starting march 31st also i've been working on something super fun with bad habit where i get to create my favorite bundles of products for you guys so that you guys know what my faves are and all of that so stay tuned for that thank you bad habit for sponsoring this video back to packing now see i always like to bring my full shampoo and conditioner so that i know i'm not gonna run out but like this is not gonna fit oh i did get those new travel containers this is the lifesaver i didn't know i needed how am i gonna know which one's shampoo and conditioner i'm gonna forget okay do you know what this is gonna take me forever to squirt all this in here so i'll call you back okay finish we have shampoo and conditioner hair serum and body wash but i was too lazy to pump the whole thing full so i just stopped halfway through because i'm only gonna be there for five days in here we have all the skin care hair brush toothbrush toothpaste deodorant you know the whole nine yards and then i'm bringing makeup wipes i know we all hate them but i have so many left over and i need to use them up chances are i won't even be wearing makeup but if i do might as well use up these stupid makeup wipes god bless you all so i'm picking out my outfits and i'm excited about the first one [Applause] i love this leather vest so this is my first outfit this one's definitely being packed this would be perfect for like a morning stroll to get coffee etc etc and the fingerless gloves outfit number two this one is a little bit more ballsy having fun with the knits having fun with the patchwork feeling like a polly pocket a little bit so this is outfit number two i'm kind of iffy on this one but i feel like who cares because i don't know anybody in new york so it's not like i'm walking around l.a fearing that i'm gonna see somebody i know at the grocery store when you're in new york you don't know who you're gonna see and nobody gives a [ __ ] and that's why i like new york outfit number three when i tell you that there's probably an hour in between each clip there is an hour in between each clip um i'm gonna try to pick out two more because i don't want to overdo it because i don't think i'm gonna have space in my suitcase packing for packing for a winter trip is the most frustrating thing because you're packing your bulkiest [ __ ] that you have in your closet in order to stay warm but there's just not enough space for that [ __ ] i'm also packing gloves like i didn't even know i had gloves outfit four i'm getting really tired and i'm gonna have to clean up my closet after this because i made such a big mess one or two more outfits then i'm done let's do it outfit five this is a casual little jean converse button up with the turtleneck under vibe this is very comfortable not very fashion but kind of interesting i want to do one more outfit and then i'm going to be done because i need to start slowing down because it's like i'm not gonna have suitcase room for all of this as is but i feel like one more outfit wouldn't hurt anybody next i feel like that's enough outfits um god only knows what i'm actually gonna end up bringing you won't believe this i have room to spare which means i'm probably gonna be bringing i don't know some extra accessories or something but i'm not gonna worry about that right now because my back hurts and i'm not kidding it took two and a half hours to pick out all those outfits so i'm gonna lay in bed i just thought about something what happens if i go shopping while i'm there although i the last thing i need to do is go shopping so maybe it's better if i don't leave any space in my suitcase to shop because i just ow ow i pinched my hand in my glasses okay i'm gonna go on my phone i haven't been on my phone all day honestly it's kind of amazing it's like should i break the streak okay maybe i'll watch youtube hi we are in my bathroom you might be asking emma where is the time gone i'm asking myself the same thing apparently picking out those outfits completely wiped me out here's what's up i spent the last few hours um in bed eating leftovers because i'm a chef now that's it i've been in bed for a very long time and to be honest i feel disgusting because i have not showered in two days i almost said two weeks which wouldn't probably shock some of you because you guys think i'm stinky well i actually am stinky right now so we need to fix that and i also need to do a hair mask when i'm in the shower i'm going to shave i'm going to moisturize when i get out i'm just i just want to feel good right now because i feel kind of disgusting you have to apply the hair mask to wet hair but i don't want to get in the shower just to get my hair wet just to get back out so i like to use these spray bottles that i got on amazon and it takes kind of forever to do it like this but i do it anyway just use a freaking spray bottle i don't think i've said the word freaking instead of [ __ ] in like three years i don't know why that just happened and i feel weird and sick about it to be honest like i'm a big kid now i use big kid bad words yeah i'm a big kid now take hair mask and just i don't even know how to apply this properly to be honest a big area of breakage for me is the back of my head a lot of the hair in the back of my head is breaking off because i'm in bed so much should i do a face mask too why not so recently i've gotten into jade rolling now i know i'm late to the trend because i feel like everybody's been doing this for years it does some sort of drainage tactic in your face so that it's like to help with puffiness i don't know i don't know if this will work but i'm thinking i put the mask on and then i use the jade roller of whatever the [ __ ] this is to rub it in like is that stupid i'm gonna take my mask i'm gonna rub this the hair clip rips a bunch of my hair out on accident and that's something i'm just gonna have to deal with so the truth about bleaching your hair it comes at a price yes blondes have more fun but that is temporary the fun is temporary and the nightmare nightmare is forever it's not forever my hair will grow back but okay i think you're supposed to like go under your eyes i don't know the areas i'm supposed to be doing it on so i could very much be doing this wrong but don't follow my direction here because i'm new to this thing i don't know what i'm doing maybe here like this feels good i'm just gonna be intuitive with it if it feels good i'm just gonna do it it's wait when i rub it guys watch what happens i have an eye spasm look at my eyebrow my eyebrow has a spasm when i when i oh what the [ __ ] maybe on my neck too okay don't do that on your neck that didn't feel good i'm done with that that was fun but i don't know what it did so next element of self-care i want to make tea so i've been trying to drink herbal tea because it makes me want to drink water because it tastes better but it also has you know hopefully something nutritious in it not nutritious i guess what would it be i don't know it's herbal something herbal in it that's good i don't know [ __ ] you think i'm a doctor [ __ ] step one to making iced herbal tea this is the most obvious tutorial i think you could ever ask for but you're gonna take a kettle and you're going to heat water until it is boiling hot now you could do this on the stove but ever since i discovered kettles my life has been changed forever next you're going to take a tea bag lemon ginger is a great combination anything with ginger in it [ __ ] it next you're gonna want to grab your lemon juice and i like to use a mug that's larger than average to make tea then you put your tea bag in the mug i'm debating whether or not i shaved my legs in the shower i know it would feel so good but i'm so lazy oh i need to feed the cats brief intermission boiling water now you pour it into your mug okay and now you're gonna let this steep for seven minutes or however the [ __ ] long your bag your tea bag tells you to steep it now i have seven minutes to do whatever i want [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] that's hard it makes me so mad no no [Music] i [ __ ] i got it [ __ ] i got it [ __ ] do you want a performance [ __ ] [ __ ] [Music] okay honestly you got it at the end i'm gonna get the shower and celebrate i'm shaving my legs tonight nobody can stop me i'm shaving my legs tonight see ya this is me time i'm out of the shower i've calmed down thank you for putting up with me through my little episode of pure excitement next step to making our herbal tea get some ice lots of ice because this is still a little bit hot now you're gonna do a little bit of this [ __ ] i just burned my hand a little bit and now you pee pee in a jar funny story i was actually drinking some of this the other day and i texted my mom and i convinced her that i was drinking pee and i was like this is all the rage in l.a all the girls are drinking their pee instead of celery juice now it's literally changing our lives then you're gonna add a generous amount of lemon i thought before i go to bed i could show you some of my favorite travel essentials number one we have melatonin um i'm not recommending this because although i don't think it can harm you i'm not sure melatonin helps me fall asleep next um i like to bring a sleeping mask here's my sleeping mask next we have literally 500 masks next we have two hygienic things we have gum and we have deodorant but see the funny thing about these is that these aren't necessarily hygienic they're more covering up a lack of hygiene next we have a metal straw i hate this one i don't know why it's in my bag i have way better ones i'm not [ __ ] with you this is not a plug i just genuinely have like 50 of these in my room chamberlaincoffee.com colored straws wait i'm gonna bring all of them with me oh i always bring an emergency pair of sunglasses because you never know if where you're gonna go might be bright or if you get off the plane and you feel like [ __ ] and you just wanna hide from the world another thing that i'm bringing on my carry-on is this little sony handycam i know you guys are probably like emma why do you have one of those i don't know i just i bought it because it was like pretty cheap for a camera the quality on this camera is so bad that it's almost gonna look like a home video and that's about it guys that's my carry-on um i wish i had more to share i really don't that's me trying to be an influencer okay that's me trying to be an influencer showing you like what i have in my carry-on bag as if everybody doesn't bring the same [ __ ] on their carry-on bag same thing with like remember when everybody was doing what's in my bag videos listen don't get me wrong i used to watch them and love them but when you really think about the concept it's crazy that people are so interested in what other people carry in their bag because everybody carries pretty much the same thing in their bag hey cheers my pp water thumbnail i drink pee for 24 hours what if i just titled this video i drank pee 10 million views how the internet works but you gotta love it thank you guys for hanging out with me today i had so much fun and i love you guys so much i appreciate you guys coming back and hanging out with me every week and if you're new here welcome it's clearly bedtime for me here's my melatonin guys i'm not condoning this because i don't know what it like what is it i can't read without my glasses it's sad because i just have good vision i don't know what happened to me actually i do know what happened i have astigmatism google it i don't know what it is either here's your forehead kiss i hope you have an amazing rest of your day rest of your week and i'll see you guys soon [Music] [Applause] you

-emma chamberlain",2021-03-21T16:55:35Z,245220,6664675,8709,good morning [Music] it's 7 20 in the morning for me i just keep going to bed earlier and earlier every night and that makes me wake up earlier and earlier every day so yeah i'm kind of giving off grandma vibes so let's go downstairs also thank you crocs for sponsoring this video you know sometimes i wish i was just one of my cats because i know that neither of them have ibs i know neither of them have stomach pains it's coffee time but it's a cold brew day i don't have the energy to do the whole espresso machine thing for starters chamberlaincoffee.com straw chamberlaincoffee.com this is a new advancement it is oat creamer i usually use almond coconut creamer anyway let's talk like what am i doing today etc i have two interviews today i don't know why i have interviews all the time and that's about it so you know what i think i'm gonna do i think i'm gonna make my lunch now so it's obviously like 7 30 in the morning but i'm gonna make my lunch now so that i don't have to cook later we never cook this early in the morning but i really am inspired to make these guess what i'm making spring rolls i made them for the first time yesterday and let me tell you they turned out like [ __ ] appearance wise but they tasted so good so i'm going to show you how i make them okay so first step i'm getting a plate and filling it with water here's the cutting board and now i'm gonna get out all the toppings there's a lot of toppings okay we have some tempeh which i've actually showed a recipe to that before we have some avocado okay we have some bell pepper cabbage which this is pretty much the only time i'll eat cabbage because i kind of hate it otherwise and mint this knife is dirty but i just used it for doing this yesterday so i feel like it's acceptable the moment of truth oh she's gorgeous okay so i've been trying to find new ways to cut avocado that's like more like efficient and let's try out a way that i saw on tick tock so you slice it like this and then you peel it oh that was kind of amazing and then you can thinly slice it like this okay maybe we don't thinly slice it with me around although i feel like wait it's kind of just more convenient to go like this and slice it like this and then just [ __ ] take a spoon oh my god that's so much easier okay sorry that was not a hack actually that just makes it more complicated mint so the thing about spring rolls is i used to love them growing out so much and i remember there was always like something in it that made it so unique and i figured out after looking at a bunch of recipes that it's mint and i never realized that they had put mint in it and then i was like omg i can't make these without the mint so now here we are and i'm using laying out my cabbage i literally hate cabbage like i don't like it some bell pepper these spring rolls you have to act fast that's all i'm saying you take it i'm still not good at this like do not expect a lot from me here right now put it in the water putting it in the water makes it sticky then we're going to add a few pieces of tempeh a few pieces of avocado and we're going to add some mint it's too much then we're gonna add some bell pepper and we're gonna add some cabbage this is a lot of toppings but i think we can make it happen now you're gonna roll it and put pull on the sides wait this might be my best one yet and [ __ ] it busted open it may have broke but i'll still eat it later because there's no need to waste let's try again i'm not gonna get discouraged okay see this one might be better because i soaked it for a little bit longer i'm stressed i already know what's gonna like what's gonna happen when i try to roll this up right now ah that was better wow that was better it still looks like [ __ ] but oh my god it's like on oh why is this happening okay i'm not gonna lie i shouldn't have done this so early in the morning because i am getting actively frustrated oh wait it worked maybe i tried to re-roll this one no this one's like too far gone this one is a little bit too far around got it but we're still gonna eat it because you don't waste i'll make one more i don't know how they make them so perfect at the [ __ ] restaurants i'm just trying to make this look relatively okay at this point when i was watching youtube videos people were like oh like you know you can have fun with the design of it and like more concerned about like how it looked i'm like no i just want it to like look relatively okay talk about a well-deserved lunch though ah that was good that was not bad this one is upsetting me like this one genuinely hurts my feet like it looks so bad now let's make the sauce the key to every good sauce is peanut butter peanut butter is like the one food that i could just eat sriracha just eyeballing all of it soy sauce eyeballing it a little bit of sesame oil eyeballing rice vinegar eyeballing a little bit of ginger eyeballing it i think that's all i added see this is exciting right it's almost like i packed myself a lunch for school here's my peanut sauce gorgeous gorgeous listen they're very gorgeous to me listen they're gorgeous oh i have peanut butter on my hand not poopy i swear that's not dookie i'm gonna eat them i'm gonna love them and it's at the end of the day it's all about me anyway so time for our special sponsor today crocs thank you to crocs for sponsoring today's video i'm excited about this rocks are like the best shoe for when you want to walk around be comfy and live your best

online at crocs.com and back to the video look at this one this one's like coachella themed okay i'm done i'm done i haven't learned a new drum beat in like three weeks because i've been a little bit too depressed to work on my hobbies yeah so every time i take a break from playing drums and i come back like i lowkey sound better so whatever i don't care once my brain uh likes me a little bit more i will learn more drum beats until then i will play the same ones over and over again it's 8 20. um i already made my coffee like i don't know what else do i do i fed the cats i have um two hours until my first interview i'm not gonna shower although i'm quite dirty not in the mood to work out so i'm not gonna do that you guys know what that means i have not moved time for my interview luckily i don't have to show my face on the zoom i can have my camera off that's awesome because i look like [ __ ] hi what's up everyone i think i'm gonna make the premise of this video 24 hours in my house challenge i didn't leave once unless i decide to leave but i don't see that happening i'm ready for brunch let's try our beautiful spring rolls cute little spring rolls i'm gonna eat the one that's falling apart the most first because i just want to get it out of my life to be honest it tastes so good it might not look the cutest but like i snapped on the flavor i love this so much i'm [ __ ] stoked okay i know you guys are probably grossed out watching me eat so i will finish this off camera my god those spring rolls i'm like freaking out you know that's why i like cooking it's like when i make something and it actually works i feel so badass like i i genuinely feel like badass anyway i'm trying to figure out what kind of creamer i've been exploring with new kinds of creamer maybe i'll try the sweet cream all vegan not that i'm vegan but i'm vegetarian but no milky in there maybe add a little bit of caramel in there i'm experimenting it's kind of fun second copy of the day i'm gonna try to stop after this one but lord knows i will not i just got groceries delivered let's see what i got almond milk tempeh tahini oh i got these new spring roll wrappers to try because these ones had really good reviews brussels sprout broccoli broccoli avocado more broccoli that's it i accidentally always buy things i have probably 15 jars of peanut butter because every time i'm at the grocery store i'm like oh i'm probably running out of peanut butter when in reality i'm never running out of peanut butter but now i have 40 jars of peanut butter one two three this is just peanut butter guys five okay that's it but that's still out of control so this is the stuff i'm gonna be filming all day such as my cat's eating me in bed uh that's about it because i am doing the 24 hours in my house challenge no leaving aloud can i do it back to bed for me this is literally what i look like 90 of the day are you ready i have another interview at 1pm it is noon right now the problem is i do need to look slightly presentable for this one but showering's not really in the cards for me to be honest i really only shower when i have to so i'll be here for a while i have a zoom interview that's actually kind of important in 10 minutes and i look like this so we're gonna figure out how to make me have a ten minute glow up follow me ladies and gentlemen this is not gonna be pretty i also have to pee but i'm gonna pee off camera because you know what i'm trying to have some sort of healthy boundary with the camera i'm thinking a sweater for the top half should i wear a turtleneck like a little classy red turtleneck i'm keeping the sweatpants on those are staying on time to do hair i farted yes i farted everybody [ __ ] relax my hair is extremely oily look at my hair oh my god it looks so weird okay that's kind of cute i'm gonna take the zoom in bed though because i'm just like not in the mood but this is the this is the hack to looking like you have your [ __ ] together on zoom reading glasses let me tell you i need them anyway because i have something called astigmatism which makes my vision kind of a little bit suspicious and sus okay with these i just bought these and then i have these these are fire i think i'm gonna wear these these are a little bit too much so i think we're actually gonna do these now i'm going to give you a pov of what i'm gonna look like on the zoo hi thank you for interviewing me today i'm gonna be talking about being an influencer i love taking selfies and um so that's pretty much what i do you guys have any more questions for me for this interview i feel like i kind of looked put together though also i just got these glasses and they are blue light glasses which means that they protect my eyeballs from the blue from something so not only will i be reading in style but my circadian rhythms that are normally damaged by the blue light of my phone and laptop say goodbye to that i'm going to be getting the best sleep of my life soon showtime [ __ ] call number two of the day is this all i do i also kind of like [ __ ] but whatever hi [Music] huh how are you good how are you i don't know what other oh my god i look like [ __ ] right now what the [ __ ] okay so no more drums for me because i just looked in in the hello oh i thought somebody wronged my doorbell watch this movie magic i feel better fit check [Music] what the [ __ ] do i do now i don't know what to do with my life i haven't known what to do with it in a long time and i'm stinky i smell like [ __ ] right now if you could smell me you guys would be [ __ ] throwing up in your little mouths you guys would be [ __ ] puking i feel like i should just cook something because i'm bored but i'm not hungry i don't know what to do honestly we're getting back into bed like this is where i'm at right now oh yeah i literally love it in here i love it so much i'll let you know if something interesting happens it's been a few hours i am still in bed but i had a genius idea we're doing a tier list now you might be like emma what are you tear listing i took various photos of me from throughout my life and of some things that i have been interested in in the past and i'm going to rate my phases i'm going to rate all of my different phases from obsessed to pain so first we're going to rate my cheerleading phase i'm going to rate this obsessed i would go back and be a cheerleader any day if you meet a 50 year old dad that used to be on his high school football team and you ask him about it that's how i am with cheerleading yeah it was you know it was 2014. and we won the competition and the crowd went crazy that's going there next phase newborn baby phase i was a [ __ ] cute kid so i'm gonna say obsessed okay so so far the tier list is looking a little bit narcissistic so hopefully something unfortunate comes up soon oh great middle school emma i would consider myself one of the most annoying and unfortunate middle schoolers ever so i'm gonna put her in you next we have my high school cross country phase so i decided it would be a good idea to run cross country in high school as much as i hated this phase i give myself a point for trying so i'm gonna put this in eh because i try next we have my indie music phase okay so this was freshman year of high school i just started listening to things like you know mac demarco and tamin paula and i thought that i was a genius as corny as it is and as embarrassed as i am of it now i still am her a little bit and so i'm gonna put her in eh because even though she was kind of a poser she didn't have terrible taste it's just more the fact that she would take a photo like this in a record store to try to prove to everybody that she had good taste that's what's embarrassing about it but because she had good taste deep down i'm putting it in okay next phase is my blonde curly hair phase as a child she is precious she's precious and she's going into obsessed i love her so much i literally spent half of 2020 trying to have blonde hair like her and it didn't work okay so this is my costume phase so when i was younger i used to wear costumes every day for like probably two years this is cute but because it's a little bit weird i'm going to put it into she cute because it is a little bit weird next we have my awkward freshman in high school phase slash all girls school face i looked like a seven-year-old and that's being generous i'm gonna put her into you because i think my catholic all-girls school phase was definitely not my peak oh my god this is probably the worst i've ever looked in my life to be brutally honest i was maybe 13 here and i'm wearing ballet flats with jeans in a hoodie i mean things were not going well for me i'm putting this into pain this next one was my glam phase honestly she's killing it so i'm gonna put her in obsessed next we have my pinterest phase that i went through in high school this was when i used to try to take photos that were very pinterest-y i would post like six times a day on instagram for all of my high school followers to see i mean she was kind of a mini influencer so i'm gonna put her in she cute as much as i was annoying everybody by like you know trying to post these artsy vacation photos it was a telltale sign of where i was going to end up next we have my poopy jacket phase it was so disgusting it literally had boogers embedded in it because i wore it so much but i'm actually going to put her in she cute because my poopy jacket phase was kind of iconic next we have my fortnite phase so in the beginning of quarantine i got really obsessed with fortnite i kind of loved this phase like i kind of loved the fortnight phase because i had so much fun i used to play fortnite for eight hours a day i i like i was having a great time and it really made the first few months of quarantine go by fast so i'm putting it in obsessed actually no i don't think i'm obsessed with it i think i'm gonna put it in she's cute oh next we have my really bad acne phase so i'm blowing up this photo extra large so you can see uh this was the worst my acne ever got this was probably two years ago i basically had terrible acne that would not go away no matter what i would try this photo is of me in a dermatologist's office crying my eyes out i'm going to put this in pain because that was not fun okay next we have my plum phase this was when i was obsessed with plums i still am obsessed with plums but there was one summer where it was just like all i cared about and there they don't get me wrong they are delicious but i feel like i'm not as passionate about them as i used to be i'm gonna put this in she's cute because plums are delicious it was a little bit weird how obsessed i was with them it must have been the season of plums that season because they just were [ __ ] amazing okay next we have my sassy middle school phase my intro to brandy melville phase okay i'm wearing a shirt that says too sassy for you i'm posing like a [ __ ] idiot so i'm just gonna put it in ew because it's not like painful to see it it's very predictable it's like most people have a phase like that you know i'm not proud of her but i'm also not mad at her next we have my phase where i was going on influencer trips a lot and it was kind of a time to be alive honestly it was really fun i'm going to put her in a because it looked like she was having fun on social media but deep down she was kind of empty inside okay next we have my coachella phase to be honest my coachella phase is never ending i'm gonna put this in she's cute because listen i still love coachella i think that my obsession with it is slightly unhealthy which is why i'm not putting her in obsessed because i'm still kind of in the phase i have to be nice to myself here and put her and she's cute because my coachella phase is still going okay next we have my blonde phase my most recent blonde phase i was blonde what eight months ago wait not eight months oh stop you're gonna knock over my camera um i just went back to brunette a few months ago but i was blonde for a decent part of 2020 and i'm putting her in obsessed next we have my cat face this is a photo of me with my cats my cat face is actually current my cat phase has been going on for probably three years i'm putting her in obsessed getting cats has been the best thing i've ever done and i love them even though they're kind of annoying sometimes i love them so much that my cat face deserves to go and obsessed and last but not least we have my current phase a little bit emo short brown dying hair and i mean you know what i'll put her in she's cute because i don't i'm not hating it even though all of my hair is falling out from all the bleach that's underneath the brown hair is that it is that all the phases i have okay guys that's all the phases i have so i just you know put together the brief list i really had fun doing this actually so if you guys want me to do this again let me know and i will do it again anyway i've literally just been in bed all day going downstairs every like 45 minutes to get a snack and then coming back upstairs and laying back down in bed that's literally it so i wish i did more stuff but i don't and that should be okay but it's not with me but i don't have energy to do anything else and it's really hot in my room right now and i'm sweating my ass off don't want to move check i'm so tired it's like 7 30. this is about the time of the night these days where i get tired but i'm hungry so let's make dinner no okay i don't know what i'm gonna eat oh i just farted i'm so tired this is one of my favorite broccoli recipes it's so easy just take tahini add it to a bowl olive oil lemon that's probably too much we're gonna do some salt some zatar pepper i think that's all mixed taking a dirty knife i think i'm gonna have a veggie burger for dinner because that sounds delicious i don't know no i don't know if i want a veggie i don't know like i'm just like i'm trying to think about what would take the least effort and i'm struggling i really did it i did the 24 hours of my house challenge i was in bed all day to be brutally honest i feel like [ __ ] did i miss an ingredient somehow i can't remember but it definitely needs more tahini okay yes i'm messy when i do this it probably needs more salt that shit's good i have absolutely zero ideas for what to make for my main dish oh is this confusing to make because i will not do it i might order food i'm having a [ __ ] cooking meltdown because i'm not inspired as a chef and do you know how important that is cause i have leftovers like i'm so lazy right now you know what we're going to make pasta because it's easy and um i bought this new kind i'm a little nervous because if it sucks i'm going to be a [ __ ] rat so i cook this for how many minutes like they're kind of a fun looking noodle i know that these look weird but it's because they're made out of edamame beans which is a great source of protein for us vegetarians what kind of sauce are we thinking guys let's see what the recipe on the back of the box says for me to do oh this is a weird recipe actually cauliflower green bean sun-dried tomato chive that's unique sesame ginger sauce kind of sounds good you know what let's do that i'm going to add some soy sauce also on the back here it kind of has a sesame ginger sauce so i'm going to kind of use that as inspo sesame oil this is like my most used grocery item to be honest they say to add lemon juice but i feel like lime would be better on the back of this so i'm just gonna add lemon oh [ __ ] when i say i'm adding a tiny bit of sriracha i mean tiny like i'm adding close to none just because i just want a little kick let's see how that tastes guys i'm actually excited are we boiling no i'm gonna use my old dirty fork from earlier also i'm gonna add sesame seeds on top oh maybe add some chili flakes i'm so excited while we wait let's make me a beverage um the beverage i'm about to make is going to confuse some of you all water well ice update i'm out of sparkling water so my original drink idea is cancelled i was gonna make a sparkling water with apple cider vinegar in it because i drink that sometimes because i'm convinced it helps my stomach not hurt as much that is not proven by absolutely any science i don't think it could be but i don't know actually i do have sparkling water but it's raspberry lime that's kind of impressive just waiting on my oh my god here things are taking too long that's the one thing about cooking that's hard whatever gets finished first and then you have to wait like 30 minutes and then the other thing's done and then you eat that and then next thing you know it's been four hours and you're still cooking thanksgiving for my grandma must be a [ __ ] nightmare and nobody's giving her credit yum so this is my first course while i [ __ ] wait for my stupid water to boil it's been literally 45 hours y'all we're not boiling yet i'm getting [ __ ] pissed ladies and gentlemen she's at a rolling boil never thought i'd see the day if this turns out shitty i'm calling the police be yummy from mommy okay and that's the only situation that that should ever be that sentence should ever be sold all right i think it's done it's all floating and [ __ ] that's like usually what a good sign time for the fun part adding the sauce this might be a bust guys this might be a bust gonna add some chili flakes a lot i'm gonna add soy sauce see i shouldn't be just like adding it in randomly but something can you tell i'm like hungry and lazy like i just have absolutely no precision okay this is not what i thought it was gonna be like but i'm gonna try it anyway and see if i need to order in is it as good as i thought no but am i going to eat it absolutely i'm in bed 24 hours in my house challenge i think it would have been good for me to go outside at least once but it was a challenge i actually do this challenge quite frequently but today i really made an effort you know to not even like step outside give sauce on my face oh no that's just a rash got it okay noted those noodles that i ended up making they i as i continued to eat them they got better and better to be honest i was hangry and i feel so much more calm and happier now so thank you guys for coming on that journey with me anyway it's me and declan here and we want to just sign off and say sweet dreams we love you so much here's your forehead kiss declan do you want to give a forehead kiss to your friends that was a declan forehead kiss anyway i'll give you one more thank you guys for watching thank you guys for hanging out with me every week i love you guys so much also big thank you to crocs for

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-03-14T19:21:08Z,254148,4209562,6222,hi [Music] i know you're probably like emma we've never seen you this put together in your life what's going on i get it i just got home from a shoot it's about 3 p.m but yes i have little extensions in i have the makeup done i kept it on because i was like why not enjoy this because i never feel fully put together so i was like you know what i'm just going to enjoy this while it last also i need to get an instagram photo with my hair like this because i look way better than normal it's coffee time you guys know the drill i'm making a latte today instead of cold brew i've been on like a cold brew kick but i'm back on my espresso [ __ ] and to be honest there is a reason why i'm back on my espresso [ __ ] and it's because the new chamberlain coffee fancy mouse espresso blend is now out link in bio chamberlaincoffee.com new espresso blend this [ __ ] is fire i'm making it right now i'm obsessed with it it's so [ __ ] good it's delicious and it's so good everybody check it out chamberlaincoffee.com [ __ ] delicious i'm gonna give you guys some sexy b-roll [Music] that was cinematic and hot let's continue this b-roll [Music] quick little update so you know what's going on today is thursday and next week is the louis vuitton show it's fashion month fashion week whatever the [ __ ] louis vuitton is having their fashion show next week on tuesday and unfortunately i can't go to paris like i normally do when there's not a pandemic so i'm going to be watching the louis vuitton show from home but louis vuitton decided to surprise me with something and it's outside of my house or it's going to be soon from what i've gathered it sounds like i'm going to be doing my fitting in like a really cool van or something and they're bringing it right to my house which is great and i get to do my fitting in there because even though i don't actually get to go to the show they still want to make me feel included so i still get to do a fitting and get to pick out an outfit i know it seems kind of pointless it's like emma why are you doing a fitting for a louis vuitton outfit when you don't even get to go to the show um instagram photos because listen it's all about the photos me taking photos in a louis vuitton outfit pretending i'm at the show in paris is like the same thing right they're here with my special surprise and here's a special surprise for you my mom my mom is gonna film this surprise for me slash this fitting i don't really know what they've set up for me my mom has seen it what do you think it's pretty cool so let's go check it out why is this in my driveway and why does it have my initials on the door what's going on oh my god okay so they're letting me have this whole thing all to myself i can take my mask off because i'm alone in here except for with my mom so my mom's filming me i have free reign and i get to pick out an outfit so what are we gonna do obsessed with this i really like this but the problem with dresses is that they're always too long for me so i usually just give up while i'm ahead to be honest oh this is like a need for me so i'm gonna put this aside see like these are unbelievable this reminds me of the magic school bus somebody please tell me you know what i'm talking about god this is so good these are i know my mom probably you love these huh please turn those on please those are very cool [Music] cute b-roll queen you're not a good filmer you're laughing at me because i'm so sure these are very cute but they will need to be altered a little bit like if they were like this and they were cropped that would look cool and my mom's laughing at me because i'm sure nothing ever fits but shut up mom you seriously are a hater and you don't get it ignore the fact that the pants don't fit me right now but this wait i love this i'm obsessed with i love this with these pants i love this last piece okay i don't think i'd wear these two things together but this sweater is unbelievable so i don't know what i'm gonna end up picking to wear for the show aka my appearance at the show that is just on instagram because i can't actually go vibe while i'm in this crazy outfit let's look at shoes oh we have honestly this kind of looks sick even with the socks why do i like it with the socks these shoes are a must for me these are like my dream shoes so i'm just gonna i'm not even gonna look any further honestly i know this is kind of a crazy fit but i'm like kind of a crazy girl basically what i'm trying to decide is do i like the top half or the bottom half better okay so i have a lot to work through here because i don't know what i want to do but you guys will see my final outfit but big thank you to louis vuitton for setting up this literal fun house for me i'm back inside i put put on pjs and i'm gonna present to you the outfit that i chose piece number one controversially piece number two yes we did do a matching set it's gonna be a lot but then again when you post a photo on instagram like there's no limit for some reason you can really wear the craziest [ __ ] on instagram and nobody will think twice whereas you wear crazy [ __ ] to the grocery store everybody's looking anyway last but not least shoes these beauty queens so my mom and i are gonna take photos and i need to take them on the camera that i'm filming on right now because i'm a well bad youtuber and i only have one camera good morning please focus i don't have the [ __ ] energy for this it's five in the morning and it's time to watch the show the louis vuitton show virtually i'm so tired i had this whole plan initially i was like okay emma you're gonna wake up at 4 30. go downstairs and make coffee and then you're gonna change into your outfit and then you're gonna brush out your hair and then you're gonna watch the show that was wishful thinking and it was cute that i thought that i would want to do that oh my god the show's starting here we are we're watching i love that pattern right there i love these like kind of like embellished with rhinestone things like kind of reminds me of a mermaid or something i very much enjoy it i love that jacket i would wear that jacket right now i love this beading i'm obsessed oh those pants i love that dress i love that dress that jacket is such a great closet staple [Music] i love how she's just walking by herself and she just isn't nervous at all that would scare the living [ __ ] out of me okay everybody we watched the show my review it was so great not going to paris is a bummer of course like i love going to paris i love going to fashion week it's like my favorite thing ever but i enjoy watching it from home because i really get to enjoy it and all of my focus and energy goes towards watching the show rather than me thinking about what i look like i'm like thinking i'm trying to decide i'm like do i go back to sleep because it's only 5 15 and i'm done well i'm gonna make a coffee i've been using a caramel flavored creamer instead of my usual vanilla i can't figure out if i like it better or if i just like it in a different way it's the little things that get me excited thank you louis vuitton for inviting me i love you guys these are my best friends whether you like it or know it or not cute oh my god how cute they gave me a plate which i actually love because i can use that for serving things now that i'm a chef because yes i am now into chefing it up thank you louis vuitton wait what's on the top macaroon check now let's go back upstairs so i can figure out what i'm gonna do with my life right now back in bed in retrospect i don't think i needed to wake up at five in the morning to watch the show there's something on the screen okay that looks permanent that is not good so in retrospect i don't think i needed to wake up at five to watch the show because obviously they pre-record it and i could have watched it at any time of the day today actually but there's something so satisfying about saying well i watched it with everyone else the question is did i self sabotage in this way should i have just waited until i woke up naturally at like 7 30 in the morning to watch the show honestly in retrospect probably yes but i love the adventure of needing to wake up at like five in the morning for something i'm like thinking about people on my instagram being like emma why did you wake up at five in the morning to watch the show i'm different i'm different i'm not like everybody else this is my dilemma right it's almost six in the morning i'm fully awake now like i'm like logged i'm logged on like i'm tuned in i don't have anything i need to do right now i have a shoot at 9am for a magazine and i never bring you guys along with me to my shoots but because you know we watched the louis vuitton show i felt like i'd take you guys with me to my shoot because doing a magazine shoot and watching a fashion show it's a very fashion day and i love days like this so i wanted to share one with you until 9 00 a.m i don't know what i'm gonna do it's like not time for my morning poop yet at all i wish it was but it's not i'm not hungry because it's [ __ ] five in the morning so i haven't even digested my dinner you know i'm like my body just doesn't know what to do i think i'm gonna watch some youtube so bye guys i was just laying in bed it's been like two hours and look what i see it's a rainbow today's gonna be a good day i need to start getting ready soon but i have no motivation to i also have to pee really bad so time to get ready the thing about going to shoots is that i just change into a more socially acceptable pair of sweats it's not like i'm like getting into an outfit it's like okay i'm gonna go from dirty gross sweaty sweatpants to a slightly more socially acceptable pair of sweatpants slightly more socially acceptable we're ready god i've been i have been awake for way too long now we map to the location all righty i do usually two different types of shoots i do shoots either for a brand which is super fun or i do them for like a press opportunity which is like a magazine or newspaper or something like that so today we're doing a magazine these are usually a lot more fashion based a lot more fun there's a lot more creative freedom shut up i think we're gonna shoot six outfits um and i'm very excited i like doing shoots like this because it's just fun to play dress up for the day so i'm excited made another coffee i forgot to film it because i was kind of in a rush because even though i woke up four hours early i still managed to like procrastinate until the very last minute to get ready because that's just who i am baby i'm excited to see what outfits i'm going to be wearing unfortunately i won't be able to show you my outfits i know it's annoying it's like i'm vlogging a shoe but i can't show you any of the outfits that's like the whole point i know you guys can totally slap my hand here on this one also i'm wearing a new perfume i get so nervous when i change my fragrance because i feel like people aren't gonna recognize me like it's so weird but it's like i feel like people if they smell a different fragrance on me they're gonna feel like i've changed like i'm not kidding hey everybody how do you like do a hair tie on these without making it look bulky oh my god wait i'm going to show you okay because i've been trying to figure it out we're going to spray a little haircut at the end what you're doing is you're running your fingers through the end so it's right tangle back up stop stop all you need to do is you flip it through stop you are kidding me that is [ __ ] life changing more oh oh my god you're never gonna do it on yourself no i'm not so i know because i'm a [ __ ] face i don't even think i own hairspray i am about to start but i'm gonna show you my breakfast haul zucchini carrot muffin we got seasonal fresh berries and fruit look they feed you good on these photo shoots okay look at this [ __ ] anyway i'm gonna start now but i'll talk to you later bye it has been six hours and we're done i didn't get to show literally anything because it's all a secret but let's go home now that's a wrap on emma that's a wrap okay i'm leaving oh wait why am i putting my mask on i'm [ __ ] driving away i unfortunately could literally show absolutely no elements of that shoot all of it was kind of top secret [ __ ] i'm getting really close to this car oh my god i love you so much i was watching your old videos yesterday like i'm even during my annoying phase you're real thank you so much i love you i appreciate it so much i love you have the best day that was a really special moment oh my god that made me feel so good i loved that god i can't get the [ __ ] angles right on this camera right now um we're done i'm going to go home i'm going to eat and then i'm going to sleep for the rest of the day because there is no reason that i've been awake for this long and now my camera's falling i swear to god i am at the end of my goddamn rug sorry sorry for yelling stop i'm like talking to my tripod i swear to god this tripod is dead to me it just kind of hit me that i've been up since five in the morning like i feel like i maybe i should be more tired to be honest but i'm at a point where i'm kind of numb i don't want to cook right now but i also don't want to wait for food to get delivered to my house so that's the predicament i find myself in daily it's like okay if i postmate something i can at least just lay in my bed until it shows up but if i cook then it'll be done in like half the time it's also only 3 p.m right now like it's literally so i just had a really bad period i have a lot of groceries at home i'm turning into a mom like you know moms are always like we don't need to go out to eat we have groceries at home i just said that to myself emma no eating out you have groceries at home shut up not me trying to wash my makeup off in the car i don't think that's illegal i don't break out like i used to but i definitely still have breakouts when i wear a lot of makeup oh my god i'm wearing fake lashes i forgot i should not have started this journey right now i'm home and i'm eating leftovers i actually don't hate leftovers part of being an adult thank you for hanging out with me for my little fashion week in la i hope you enjoyed hanging out with me sorry i am delirious i hope you enjoyed hanging out with me i had so much fun hanging out with you sorry i'm taking another bite mmm leftover i love you guys so much thank you for hanging out with me every week you guys are my baes follow your dreams be yourself so i'm gonna take a nap but i love you guys so much here's your forehead kiss and don't forget leftovers aren't so bad if you really think about it cheers [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] bye

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-03-07T18:11:16Z,303716,8917523,9646,good morning vlogmas i'm vlogging again and the thing that's funny about it is it's like why do i keep vlogging when my days just keep getting more and more repetitive i had a mental breakdown yesterday because i was like i have been living the same day over and over again for a long ass time and i think that vlogging makes me realize it even more because i'm like oh my god nothing is different we're gonna do it again because i feel like it i don't really have any plans for the day although i do kind of want to go to trader joe's if you guys don't know i i've been really into cycling classes for the past like two years i'm obsessed with cycling classes it's my favorite form of workout it's very meditative for some reason and i love it probably five days ago i got a [ __ ] soul cycle bike for at home so now i get to do soul cycle whenever i want for as long or short as i want whenever i want whenever whatever all the time whenever i want and i'm not gonna lie it's been pretty amazing i've done it three times now i'm planning on doing my fourth today honestly very curious about how i look like when i'm riding the bike um so i'll be included i also have a shoot tomorrow and look what happened to me nail broke so i have somebody coming to my house to do my nails it'll be a good day but we need to make coffee follow me follow me i'm gonna go i'm gonna do my soul cycle ride thing so i need to have an energy drink and a coffee which is not healthy first thing in your stomach energy drinking coffee good luck wow ow we're ready to go when i go really fast i'm done now okay so now my daily workout's done i do tend to feel happier after i exercise i know that there's science behind that but i just feel like if i don't start my day with like a workout or something i don't get my endorphins and listen i'm taking any endorphin i can get these days [Applause] oh my god my mom's here should we say hi to mommy sophia i'm not in the mood for that yet time for breakfast i have some overnight oats in here i put granola in it last night and i cuz i like when it gets soft but i don't know if it's like too soft i'm gonna have this hard-boiled eggs i hate cracking open hard-boiled eggs because it always takes me like 45 minutes to get all the shell off okay now i need to rinse these off because they're have debris all over them why does hard-boiled eggs have to be so complicated breakfast is served overnight oats that look a little bit scary because there's so many chia seeds in it and eggs with salt and pepper this is how you eat hard-boiled eggs and i haven't done it in a long time so let's do a taste test it needs hot sauce i used to eat this hot sauce in high school the pepper plant let's try it with the sauce mmm this hot sauce is very good and smoky give it a try why do i why do i [ __ ] up see when i tell you i live the same day every day it's like what do i do i work out i eat i [ __ ] play drugs what else what is like to do what else am i supposed to do oh wait [ __ ] i just remembered i have a i have an interview in like five minutes okay wait i'm so glad i remembered because i would have been [ __ ] off the wazoo i haven't even showered i'm so stinky from my [ __ ] i'm still stinky from my workout you know what you can't smell through the screen so i look like [ __ ] hopefully they don't mind hi hi my interview is over so now what just me nailing into your stinky heads that i do shower got a new shower cap the other day let's crack this baby open yes new shower cap because my other one got moldy all right i'll see you guys on the flip hi everybody oh [ __ ] you know what don't maybe just okay don't film in just a towel because this is about to fall off or demonetized if i if it falls off i'm just gonna film in clothes maybe okay so i'm gonna get dressed for the day but i thought that i would do a thrift haul and that leads us to our sponsor of today's video today's video is sponsored by thredup thredup is an online thrift store where you can shop literally any store ever they have levi's louis vuitton marc jacobs urban outfitters the list goes on they have over 3 500 brands and they're adding new styles to the website every single day it's great because you get to thrift online you don't even have to leave your bed you can thrift in bed and then get a cute polka dot package like this in the mail okay the first thing i got is this super cute paul frank t-shirt i literally used to wear paul frank so much as a kid so i just needed this when i saw it the estimated retail price for this was 24. i paid 13.99 the next thing i got are these hawaiian tropics sunglasses these give me very much mom on vacation in hawaii with her kids just being like yeah guys just don't get a sunburn just put sunscreen on i paid 16.99 for these on thredup and they were originally 24. and they kind of give me 90s vibes like i feel like britney spears slash a mom on vacation okay the next thing i got i'm obsessed with this pink wilson's leather leather jacket this literally is going to make me feel like a rock star when i wear it i absolutely cannot wait i'm obsessed can i use another word besides obsession i'm really fond of it i'm really fond of this leather jacket the estimated retail price of this 450 guess how much i paid for it 88.99 baby such a freaking steal next i got this sweater by marc jacobs you just can't go wrong with a cute little v-neck sweater you know what i'm saying the estimated retail price of this was my lips are so dry i can't smile and i paid 33.99 on thredup again a steal last thing i got is this super cute betsy johnson sweater cardigan type of thing the quality of this is like so nice the estimated retail price of this was 149 and on thredup i paid 102.99 anyway go to the link in my description and use code emma for an extra 30 off your first order with thredup i love thredup they're sustainable they are a great way to thrift because you don't even have to leave your bet and they have so many options so go check it out link in description use code emma 30 off your first order i need to get dressed for the day because it's like noon i want to wear this little paul frank t-shirt today but i think i want to crop it so i'm going to show you how i crop my shirts first i take the shirt and i put it on a hanger and i kind of shake it out to even it out because the thing is if you don't have it on a hanger you'll probably cut it unevenly and i've learned this the hard way and i've done it a bazillion times so then you lay it out okay you lay it out flat you can't even see it i'll go backwards god do you see that what the [ __ ] was that like take fabric scissors they work the best you can get them on amazon now i'm probably gonna go to about here so i draw a little s line with my scissors and then i cut now remember you can always cut off more but you can never cut off less this looks about right to me so let's get fitted up and see if i did a good job literally the most boring fit check of my life you know what i did with my car key the other day look i put it on a little keychain like this so now look i'm never forgetting my car keys again is it nerdy be honest hey so my nail lady is coming to my home at 5 00 pm it is now 1 p.m and i feel like it would be good for me to get out of the house and to be honest i haven't really left the house in 72 hours so i'm like in need of like getting out and about i need to do something because i feel kind of a little bit depressed but the show must go on i've been alone a lot lately i've been spending a lot of time alone and i i choose that i am the one that actively chooses to be alone a lot but i'm not gonna lie i do sometimes get a little bit lonely how do i say like you almost become too self-absorbed i almost feel like i become too self-absorbed when i'm by myself too much because i'm just so hyper focused on like my own problems that like i forget that anybody else exists i forget that there's a bigger picture on this in this planet on this in this world and then when you spend time with other people then you're like oh wait i'm actually like you know my my worries and stresses are not as big as i thought because there's other people on this planet there's we live in a massive galaxy like my anxieties are really not that big of a deal you know what i mean um not that it really fixes it but it can kind of fix it but i've been alone for so long or so much recently that i'm just like very much in my own head you know but my mom is visiting so that's been nice um it's also way too hot i'm turning on max ac because this is like not this is just not okay i'll scream over the ac so that you can hear me i think that i want to go to trader joe's because i haven't been there in a while okay i'm turning down the ac because i'm sick of yelling yo i'm not gonna lie like i know i say this in every single video every single vlog every time i talk i say this guys i'm running out of things to do i'm running out of my personality i just want to exist and i've never felt like that in my life i've always felt like oh i want to be um i love being loud i love talking a lot i love doing this this and that but recently i've been like you know what i just kind of want to exist in silence a lot i know i need a vacation i know i need to get out of la a little bit but i also don't want to go anywhere and see this is why i have issues i know the solution to my problem but then i don't have enough energy to do the solution i'm like emma okay just go on a road trip for the weekend but then another half of my brain is like that means you're gonna have to pack that means you're gonna have to get gas that means you're gonna have to figure out somebody to bring with you so that you're not alone so you don't get kidnapped my brain stops myself from wanting to solve my own problem and that's because i'm a gemini gemini's are really talkative loud and annoying check i checked that box what other oh i'm supposed to be quote-unquote two-faced i actually agree with that to be honest you know i i think about this and i am two-faced but not in a bad way i don't think i think i'm two-faced in a sense where i'm very very nice to everybody i guess it's not being two-faced but i i can be fake nice sometimes but it's just because i want everybody to feel good it's not because i'm trying to like harm anybody it's just that i try not to show like if i don't really like someone i'm not gonna i'll do my best to not let them know that just so that every all can be you know good and fun but like is that a negative thing i don't know you guys tell me is that being fake see i don't know like i don't know if that's being fake though trader joe's haul number one i got this turmeric ginger coconut beverage this sounds like it'd be refreshing and yummy so let's try it right now oh my god it's like bright yellow this is actually good first item turmeric ginger coconut beverage this is super refreshing nice and herbal i'm impressed by this good job trader joe's off to a good start seven and a half out of ten not bad i got another beverage i don't know why but like they have such cool milks and i'm always very intrigued this one's very popular blueberry lavender flavored almond beverage i don't know why they don't just call it almond milk i've seen so many people talk about this and the fact that i haven't tried it is honestly insane to me i think i've just assumed that i would be disappointed wait i licked the it already tastes good y'all this is good i get it i totally get the hype this is so good i thought it was going to disappoint me but oh my god i'm gonna give this an eight out of ten the blueberry lavender flavored almond beverage very good next i got almond butter almonds which is very redundant like putting almond butter on almonds but i've had something similar to this before and i feel like they were really good so let's give it a go oh my god 10 out of 10 almond butter almonds these oh my god so good what the hell trader joe's you guys are off to a good start cauliflower crisp snack i actually like it i mean i like other crackers better like these would not be my first choice of a cracker if i had a choice i'm gonna give these a six out of ten they're definitely pleasant six and a half out of ten i'll give these a six and a half out of ten they're pleasant but i'd rather eat a different cracker oh i want to try these roasted and salted truffle almonds because i love truffle flavor or like truffle flavored stuff i guess and i feel like i'm and i'm a big almond girl i love almonds so i feel like this is right up my alley guys yeah so good eight and a half out of ten oh my god trader joe's you are doing so good today okay next thing i got is so [ __ ] stupid i know that these don't work but i got these little health shots cheers actually that one wasn't that bad i think i like reacted like that just because i assumed it was gonna be worse than it was and then it wasn't that bad and then i look stupid now because i like i'm also going to take this ginger one why not right okay that one was spicy so that one hurt it a little bit i bought this spicy hummus i've never tried it i'm not going to try it right now because imagine me eating hummus in the car can't imagine wait actually you know what i'm opening it [ __ ] it trader joe's mukbang loki trader joe's spicy hummus i would give that probably a 7.8 out of 10. i really like it pretty [ __ ] good speaking of dips i got this habanero extra hot ghost pepper salsa this is supposed to be hot extra hot ghost pepper is like the hottest pepper ever i'm gonna take chunks okay so uh warning the extra hot habanero ghost pepper salsa is definitely spicy i mean i can handle it like i didn't freak out i kept cool i'm gonna give it a nine out of ten for being fun it would be a fun thing for you and your friends to buy you know eat together because it would be like funny and like a gimmick and like an activity because it's so spicy but for actual enjoyment a four out of ten is just so [ __ ] spicy that i don't know who could enjoy it next i got mixed nut butter almonds cashews walnuts brazil nuts hazelnuts pecans so this will be fun to like spread on toast or something i'm not going to try that right now i'm so sorry this is the type of nut butter that like has the oil separated on the top and if you all know how hard it is to mix then you all know that my car would be covered in oil and i also do not have a knife so i'd be mixing with my damn thingy and i don't want to do that i got two seasonings to try i got this multi-purpose umami seasoning blend i've heard a lot about this i have no idea what it's going to taste like but i hate mushrooms so i also got ground fermented black garlic i have no idea what to do with this on the back it says would be good on avocado toast in sauces on vegetables so this will be fun to try last but not least on the trader joe's haul this pesto this is the pesto that i grew up eating because my dad always shopped at trader joe's when i was growing up and this was the peso that i grew up on and it's [ __ ] amazing that was my trader joe's haul so listen if you guys are close to a trader joe's you guys live close now you know what to try out um anyway what else should i do now you know what i should do i should be a responsible adult and i have a shoot tomorrow and i need to pack for all the things that i'm going to need for my shoot and i'll bring you along with me so i just got home but i do want to try this mixed nut butter mixed nut butter um almonds cashews walnuts brazil nuts hi mommy my mom is

really like it why is it so good i mean why is it so good because it has a good is it is it okay okay sure um i like it because it has a good roasted flavor it also is a little bit sweeter than like say peanut butter because i believe it has cashews in it the brazil nuts add this like super nuttiness i mean it has like every nut under the sun in this thing that's awesome so thanks guys for

all of this and so the fact that i'm doing it tomorrow is insane but they wanted me to bring some of my own pieces so that the shoot feels personal and it's not just like a stylist putting clothes on me and then that being that right um i need to bring my favorite pair of jeans a few pair of shoes accessories a bra tmi so let's do it i'm gonna be honest with you guys i haven't worn a bra in approximately three years so i don't even know if i have a flesh colored bra i refuse to wear bras i'm so sorry i can't do it i have two nude bras literally this one is like a sports bra which i'm probably gonna beg them to let me wear and then this one's like oh let's pick out some accessories i have this cute little jewelry case that my mom got me okay i have this necklace that's super cute this is my name on it i feel like they might like that oh this necklace is cute it's just like a simple chain oh wait this one's all white and pearls okay maybe i'll i'm gonna bring this one too i may

pairs of jeans that fit me the best putting those in my suitcase i'm not gonna have room in the suitcase for shoes i never think enough they said to bring my favorite shoes so i'm gonna bring a pair of the chuck 70s and then my dog martins because they are my tried and true shoe if i can fit everything in here i'm gonna be absolutely beyond thrilled it's just not gonna it's just not looking up for me though it really isn't i hate to be the bearer of bad news here let's go get the bras now yeah we talk about bras on my youtube channel put that in putting that in bra and i think that's it this is always the dilemma i'm like should i bring my red converse like is black not good like should i not bring the black i feel like i should bring the red one because like i already have a black shoe i'm gonna bring the red one red that makes me i feel better about that decision all right i'm now packed for my shoot tomorrow it's still like late afternoon so i don't really like now i'm kind of done for the day which is honestly fine because i have to go to bed at like 9 00 p.m tonight because i have to be up at five in the morning tomorrow but i love it i love it it's exciting i forgot i had a nail appointment i keep forgetting that things are happening the amazing woman who's going to do my nails is going to show up in about 30 seconds i would normally film this um excursion but i find that it makes me so anxious to film with strangers that it's like is it even worth it so anyway these are what my nails look like now traumatizing with the power of editing they will be done in three two one they're done they're done so it is now dark out the nails took about an hour and a half um but she fixed me up right she did such a great job and it was actually so amazing having somebody come to my house and i love that experience but i am hungry so let's go make some food i'm not really in the mood to cook anything extravagant and i'm also not in the mood to eat leftovers because i have some like leftover veggies in the fridge that i made but i just like don't want to eat them i think i'm going to make a mini pizza they want to make a pizza well not really mini pizza like a medium sized pizza mini pizza pizza time i guess it's not really a mini pizza because it's like a medium sized pizza but i want to call it a mini pizza because i love the word mini and i like mini things pan pizza we're gonna like kind of load i normally just do like vegan cheese and that's it because you guys are here i want to like spice it up a little bit make it a little bit less boring i'm thinking we do green olives italian garlic fennel plant-based sausage i start with my tomato sauce splirt that on there then i take my pesto i tried to make pesto myself the other day and it just like didn't go well for some reason also the same thing with hummus when i make hummus at home it's not as good like it's still good but it's not as good so we have our base we have our pesto and our pizza sauce now we're going to add vegan mozzarella and now i'm going to try out something new i got this vegan parmesan and it's cool because it's like a block i'm not even going to try it i'm just going to put it straight on the pie oh i almost just cheese grated my nail that i just got done i should have just ordered postmates like this is just not the night to be like [ __ ] around oh my god i keep almost grating the nail guys don't let me why am i cooking right now i'm gonna take oh wait this is moldy oh wait i didn't know olives got moldy can you see that [ __ ] floating around i almost ate that so no olives on today's pizza sorry okay we're gonna take one of these veggie sausages i'm only gonna use half of it because i don't really need a full one guys having sharp knives makes cooking so much easier like i used to have the most dull knives and it made cooking very difficult put the little sausages mmm let's see if i have olives somewhere wait i also have sun-dried tomatoes should i just like plop a few on there too i don't even eat sun-dried tomatoes i don't really know what they taste like but i'm just gonna put them on here anyway and i don't even really like tomatoes so the fact that i'm doing this doesn't really make sense but now we're adding olives god this looks [ __ ] beautiful though oven a little olive for the chef bone apple tip listen i know it doesn't look great and i get that but i feel like it's going to taste good and that's all that matters look it's like mini little slices it's so cute i'm going to top it with some nutritional yeast because i like okay let's give it a try i snap wow emma's pizza gone right sun-dried tomatoes are an excellent additions i'm gonna eat this and then i'm gonna go to bed and then i'll wake up at five in the morning for my shoot thank you guys for watching thank you guys for hanging out with me i love you thank you guys for being my besties i appreciate you guys more than you even

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-02-28T18:15:46Z,307838,9719705,10356,good morning hi everybody good morning [Music] i look like a mom that goes on hikes right now and i know that it is seven in the morning it's actually 7 11 which is one of my lucky numbers i feel like normally when i vlog i don't really vlog everything and i tend to cut a lot of things out like my shower routine my workout routine my like all of it and so today i decided i'm gonna film literally everything i do today so right now it's seven in the morning i have some interviews today at around 11 30 so i needed to get my workout done early in the morning i don't want to do it it's 55 degrees i'm [ __ ] freezing i have a celsius to help me i have been driving to this hiking trail every morning to go on my run and the reason why i like it is because it's more in nature when i run around my neighborhood it does not feel like i'm in nature and it's actually depressing when i have the time and i have the motivation this has been something that i've been doing and i am kind of loving it like i'd be lying if i said i didn't love it it's like just me [ __ ] okay the lighting's gonna be bad and you guys are just gonna have to deal hey look at my mouth it's so cute it looks like i'm wearing like a cool superhero mask it's only 55 degrees and i'm literally wearing a whole like headband but i'll explain i am cold in the morning when it's 55 degrees and unfortunately for me this headband really helps the other day funny story time before we arrive at our running location the other day when i went on my run slash hike i brought uh celsius which is like a green tea energy drink and then i also brought a coffee and i drank both of those and then i went on my run there were a few things that went wrong and i know you guys don't want to hear about my bowel movements but all i can say is don't drink a lot of caffeine before you exercise unless you've maybe had a little bit of time on the toilet first i tried to go on my run and enjoy it but it was so unenjoyable i finished my run sped all the way home probably at a legal speech my point is prepare better than me also i hate the road that i have to take to get to my hiking trail because it's literally so narrow and everybody on it has the worst [ __ ] road rage if you live in l.a i'm driving on laurel canyon i don't know if that's gonna run i just don't like driving on laurel canyon why is there so much honky and honking why why are we honking our horns let's be nice let's love each other i've arrived i don't want to go it's [ __ ] freezing i farted i don't want to i farted again i don't want to go i don't want to go this happens every time i'm like emma you could just turn around and go back home but i know that i'll feel really good after i do this running uphill holy [ __ ] it will burn your damn glutes i just want to have a you know like is that how you grow your butt muscles i don't even care i don't even care i i don't think i actually i don't think my body's actually capable of growing a dump guys we're kind of close together should i just give you a forehead kiss like what three minutes into the video ow [ __ ] i hit my head oh i hit my head i met one of you guys the other day um i was at in ikea actually by the way ikea is super underrated i had a lot of fun when i was there i met one of you guys and you were like you actually smell really good like everybody says online that you're dirty but you actually smell really good so suck on that haters seriously seriously suck on that my haters aren't smelling me irl i smell pretty [ __ ] good and i brush my teeth three times a day idiot here we go [Music] okay i'm back you'll never guess what happened i'm halfway through the run i need to go to the bathroom i swear how do i avoid this anyway i'm gonna hold my desire to go to the bathroom in for the next 10 minutes because after i go on my little run i like to do a meditation i know it's shocking i like to do it after i run because there's no distractions i'm just in my car it might be weird to do it in my car uh in the middle of this hiking trail like it might be a little bit weird but i think it's early enough in the morning where nobody's gonna walk by um i use an app and i think i'm going to do i'm sorry i am okay i think i'm gonna do a loving kindness see if you can take this spirit and feeling of loving kindness for yourself and others with you throughout your day i'm up i had a really hard time focusing during that meditation i just felt like my mind was all over the place might meditate again today because i feel like that one was just i was literally like my eyes were closed and it was like blank and then all of a sudden it would be like hey you have to poop really bad and like that's what my thoughts were doing so i tried but anyway also if you see this lump in my um let me show you something it's my car key not like a really bad boob job because i know you're probably thinking that i did not get my boobs done thank you they're still small bye oh [ __ ] that's not the right one it's time to shower and that leads us to our sponsor today's video function of beauty thank you to function of beauty for sponsoring this video function of beauty is my fav hair care because it's custom you go online you take a quiz function of beauty makes the perfect shampoo conditioner and other products for your hair personally my hair is very damaged because i bleached it for eight months so i went on the site and when i was taking the quiz i selected that i wanted to fix my split ends hydrate my hair replenish my hair deep condition my hair and strengthen my hair i chose the pear scent because you can choose your scent also you can put your name on it which is really fun i've been using it honestly for over a year and i love it because it's personalized so as my hair care needs change i can change my shampoo and conditioner to match perfectly for my needs at that time when i'm blonde i need a different shampoo now that i'm brunette i need a different shampoo and not only that but they also have other hair care products one of my favorites is the serum and i put this on after i shower and it just makes my hair feel silky smooth and amazing also function of beauty is paraben free sulfate free cruelty free vegan it's great and if you want your products to be silicone free you can also select that but i don't really know anything about that go to the link in my description and get 20 off your first set i love these i've been using them for years um thank you functional beauty for sponsoring this video now i need to get in the shower because i'm wasting water so i'm out of the shower i thought i would show you some of my favorite in shower products this is my body wash it is the only thing that doesn't make me break out in hives because i have such sensitive skin johnson's head to dough wash and shampoo for babies it's embarrassing but it's the truth and then i use this face wash um it's the bad habit matcha mint daily cleanser and this is what i use in the shower i also brush my teeth in the shower with my favorite toothpaste sensitized so that's kind of my shower routine and then obviously i washed my hair using the function of beauty products that i showed earlier so i take out oh this thing is amazing too you can like walk around and let your hair kind of dry without having to like towel dry it like okay i hate this i hate trying to walk around the house with a massive towel i'm like [ __ ] swinging around and [ __ ] it doesn't stay on that's why you need a hair towel like this i'm gonna take some serum rub it into the ends i've been trying to avoid blow drying my hair so i just let it air dry because i went through a phase there where i was blow drying my hair and i think it made my hair 50 times more damaged now it's time for skin care i'm gonna do a little eye cream because my eyes have been so dry like the skin around my eyes have been so dry so i'm putting on eye cream now moisturizer and then i just got this new lip balm this lip balm i'm a huge lip balm gal like it's my [ __ ] um and i was really excited about this one because it comes with a little metal thing and you [ __ ] dip it in there and then you it's really not convenient like it's more convenient just use your finger but there's something really nice about that it's only like 10 a.m and so i have like an hour and a half until all of my calls start for the day so the question is what now [Music] i learned the beginning of a mac demarco song hopefully i don't get copyrighted for this comment down below if you know what mac demarco song that is okay i'm not i'm sitting too far from it look at me making excuses i'm like i'm sitting too far from the drum set that is why it sounds bad no but that actually sounds better so that is what the problem was okay you know what i'm gonna do right now that's really responsible and good of me i'm going to take my mugs downstairs and my cups i'm actually gonna take them downstairs guys this literally never happens but for some reason you guys are inspiring me i haven't made a coffee yet today i haven't had coffee yet today but i'm not really like ready like sometimes i like to give my tummy a break but then at the same time i'm like do i want to give my tummy a break i'm sorry cups are in the sink chamberlaincoffee.com we have these cute new tumblers i've been using them every day i go through phases sometimes i'm like all i want is a latte and then sometimes i'm like all i want is cold brew i'm having a cold brew phase this is my favorite right now lincoln bio almond milk and then we take this you guys know the drill by now it's like this is not y'all's first rodeo my favorite colored straw because drinking out of a colored straw is funner than drinking out of a normal one trust me delish fun fact about me a lot of people are like oh you know working from home you only have to dress up from the waist up for me i don't even dress up from the waist up i don't dress up at all for zoom calls i will do interviews i will do meetings in full pajamas no makeup hair in the most ratty bun you've ever seen and i don't care for me i'm like okay well then what am i supposed to do before my meetings because i don't need to get ready i can just literally sit in bed like this some people might say emma that's unprofessional i say no it creates comfort and relatability in the workplace i kind of feel a little bit nauseous which is it is concerning me like why am i getting nauseous in the mornings am i pregnant that's not really possible um well i mean one time i saw a video well whatever i'm not pregnant if my body is slightly um a little bit out of whack in some way i immediately assume i'm pregnant can you imagine me pregnant like talk about the emotional disaster sorry my hair is really soft so i'm just touching it so i've never shown me doing this before but we're gonna do a time lapse of me doing emails i know it's a crazy reality that i don't talk about it's like yes i actually do read emails not a lot because i avoid it at all costs but today we're reading emails so how you get the gist okay i have about 60 seconds before my first interview starts for the day i'm doing a few press interviews i'm actually really hungry now but i didn't manage my time god i really hope they don't mind that i look like [ __ ] because these are all on camera interviews but whatever hi emma what's up guys my calls are over whoa time to make some lunch because i wasn't hungry for breakfast now i'm [ __ ] starving and hangry i'm thinking i want to make brussels sprouts oh my god literally fit check we're gonna make some brussels sprouts and then maybe something else maybe like a veggie burger in the airfryer or something i set my oven to 450. now let's get out our ingredients brussels sprouts tahini this is disgusting this bottle is disgusting more tahini because i think that one's running out lemon juice salt and pepper harissa sumac olive oil i believe that's it when it comes to food i'm very much about convenience and so i like to cook a lot at once so that i can just eat it for the next few days i love brussels sprouts so much so many people hate brussels sprouts and i just like don't get how you could hate them like they're just so good i don't know if it's an age thing but like i'm starting to appreciate vegetables and i'm like i feel like an old loser like i feel like an old lady being like i love i love brussels sprouts i've also recently fallen in love with going to the grocery store i had a phase there where i refused to go to the grocery store but the other day i went there and i was like wait this place is low-key chill as [ __ ] and also like very therapeutic i kind of am i just turning into a mom like i'm starting to meditate i'm starting to go on walks i'm starting to enjoy going to the grocery store i can't tell if i'm just like having a crisis or if this is just like adulthood like i don't know and cooking for [ __ ] sake my mom told me the other day that cabbage and brussels sprouts are from the same family and that really made me realize that they actually look very similar like doesn't this look like a cabbage to you no shut up shut up right now leave we have all of our trimmed brussels sprouts in a bowl we're gonna add some tahini i eyeball it i don't really care as long as everything's evenly coated i'm happy yeah we're gonna add a lot of tahini that might even be too much tahini but i don't really give a [ __ ] lemon juice you can pour a pretty generous amount in there because we have a lot now load it up on the salt a lot of salt y'all crack some black pepper although this peppers grinder sucks ass now add this harissa seasoning can be pretty generous with it i like to add kind of a lot oh [ __ ] it got all over the counter and now we're going to mix oh i forgot olive oil sprinkle some olive oil in there once everything is nicely coated pan parchment paper okay now you have your beautiful brussels sprouts and the oven is not preheated yet so let's figure out what else i'm going to eat you know what i might eat i'll tell you tempeh with flax in it and tempeh is basically what even is it soy beans that are made into it's weird it's weird but it's a great source of protein for us vegetarians and i made some the other night that spicy peanut flavor and i'm just going to eat it cold i don't even care brussels sprouts will be done in probably 20 minutes so until then i'm going to clean um i know that that was very dark footage but oh my god i forgot to set a timer for my brussels sprouts god damn it okay i think they're done wow crispy brussels sprouts city so now we have the finishing touches right i like to kind of gather them all together in the center now we take a little bit of this sumac and we just drench it out a little bit more salt and then it's done now we serve a little bit for the queen the queen is me [ __ ] yes i just ate it off the floor i'm the type of person that eats in a very peculiar way i'm not putting everything on the same plate i'll go into my fridge eat [ __ ] out of the fridge and then five minutes later i'll find something else to eat i'll eat that i don't like plate up a full meal ever i need my brussels sprouts bye this vlog i put on rings randomly i was like ooh i want to put on rings why is my pinky shaking here's the next thing i need to do today i need to record podcast ads if you guys didn't know i have a podcast it's called anything goes available anywhere you listen to it or stream podcasts and i need to record some ads for it and i'll show you what that looks like so i go into my little podcast recording studio in my home which is actually my [Music] closet room sit on the ground this is where i record all my podcasts oh my god do you see my wiener oh my god you can see me in the mirror and it looks really awkward okay let's fix that so this is how i record my podcast this is my podcast recording equipment and i'm going to record a few things this is really what my day-to-day life looks like like this is what never really hits the camera it's like me like [ __ ] sitting here and recording something for my podcast which is actually anything goes uh can be found on spotify you guys can get 25 [ __ ] okay i'm done that was it i literally have nothing i want to do like i don't need to go grocery shopping i definitely don't need to go buy clothes i definitely don't need to go buy like makeup or skincare like i the last thing i need to do is go buy anything so i'm like what the [ __ ] do i do when i do this every day i'm like what today and i should get my nails done but i'm too lazy [ __ ] god damn it [ __ ] it okay that was enough of that guys i need to do something i need to do something with my day i got the things i needed to get done done today and now i'm like okay what do you do now so i think i'm gonna make a nail appointment are you kidding me hi can i make an appointment for an acrylic fill today yes that works okay thank you okay so we now have a nail appointment she's making muffins see i'm not the only one in the family who cooks time to make myself look cute i'm really not in the goddamn mood you know what i'm going to put you through the pain of watching me pick out an outfit because i know it's painful every time i'll see you when i figure it out do i love it no do i hate it no i kind of do hate it [ __ ] okay let's try again it's better it'll work i don't care you know what it's good enough for me like i'm really not in the mood to push my own boundaries today so but now i just want to get back into like do i really need to be in like a full [ __ ] do i need to be fitted up to get my nails done no i don't have to do my hair i don't know i look like [ __ ] today let's just clip it this is what we're working with like i just i gave up halfway i honestly want to change into sweatpants ew what am i doing you know what i mean no i'm getting into pjs this is what we've landed on i'm wearing these sweatpants i have a little name patch the ugg boots pink sweatshirt the sunglasses and the clip make me look probably more put together than i am this is what we're getting today folks i mean i really tried i put on the outfit i did i tried but this is what we're getting my new favorite vintage store just opened back up i keep debating whether or not i should go because i'm like do i really need to go in there no i don't but it was closed for like two months and i was so sad and then i drove by it the other day and i was like hello you're open but before i go out i do want to make a snack so what's it gonna be okay i guess we'll eat this as a snack i'm too lazy to cook something right now chia pudding so basically what's in this chia pudding it looks kind of gross it's chia seeds a little bit of oatmeal a little bit of coconut a little bit of maple syrup a little bit of vanilla extract a little bit of cinnamon and it's kind of not my favorite food but it honestly i try to eat it once a day because it helps with my digestion and then i'm using this granola vanilla almond butter then we take some raspberries are we gonna wash them no should we yes it's actually good i'm acting dramatic where are we going we're going to the vintage store i know i know i have a shopping addiction i know i would guess that 90 of women would claim that they have a shopping addiction that could be totally false that could be a terrible and wrong um hypocrisy hypothesis is that what that word is siri what's a hype paw physique wait what the [ __ ] is that word hypothesis what is that word what is an educated guess called in science here's what i found from wikipedia.org shut up hypothesis y'all did not hear any of what i just went through i don't know anyway i'm at the vintage store now so [ __ ] [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i'm so bad at parking oh my god also look where i am the infamous pink wall baby i unfortunately did make purchases so it would be inappropriate to not do a haul i literally got two of the most boring things ever number one i got this cropped yellow similar to this cropped pink it's pretty much the exact same except yellow i love these little mini cropped crewneck sweatshirts they're just so easy to throw on this just because i like it it fit really cute you know shocker another crew neck a pair of levi's that i don't need it's honestly like it's a fit thing for me if i ever find a pair of levi's that has the right wash and the right fit for me i buy them because they're just hard to come by and so and they're literally my passion that was my haul i'm sweating my ass off it's only 75 degrees but i'm not wearing i'm wearing like a wintery outfit today like this is kind of wintery at least for california so i need to go home and change i'm back i still have a lot of time until my nail appointment so i'm kind of like what are we going to do now first i'm going to take a selfie because i feel like my outfit's cool now and i want to take a selfie in it for my instagram story so we can watch that go down i feel awkward oh this is a cool angle kind of turned out cool okay see whereas like this one with my face in it let's not ever put that you know what i mean just so you guys know you know not everything is like how you see on the internet this is the type of [ __ ] i cut out i have an appointment at three i was wondering if there's any way i could come in at 2 30 maybe even get my toes done or something if i come in early sure yeah see this is what communication does guys communicate and reciprocate you know i wish that you could rip up pieces of money like let's say you had a 20 bill and somebody was like oh yeah that'll be ten dollars i wish you could just rip the 20 bill in half and give them half of it nobody's talking about that nail reveal nail reveal they said i have a rash on my face [ __ ] i've been getting so many rashes recently anyway everybody's like emma emma do a nail reveal do a now reveal relax i'm very much obsessed this lady did my nails so well she's a [ __ ] angel she was so sweet i need to put a picture of this on my story because these are really life-changing but i officially do feel like a a bad [ __ ] again i farted i just got home and i was like okay i'll probably cook dinner in an hour my nails are far too long to cook right now they're so long i accidentally got them way too long but i i didn't really think about it i was like just going with the flow and she was like are these good and i was like yeah and now they're so long i feel like i'm not gonna be able to function properly for the next few weeks with these on because they're so long nobody talks about that with nails like i literally will not be able to do anything like i don't even know if i can play drums with these worth it though because i feel like a baddie i want to drink this delicious sparkling water i can't open it without breaking it out so we need to get creative i've seen trisha paytas do this look at that a delicious raspberry lime sparkling water that matches my outfit um leftovers okay so i know that i said i can't cook because of these nails but there is one thing that i can cook and i'm gonna cook it right now because i like to have you know like those certain foods that you like to have around the house this is that for me i'm gonna show you my tempeh recipe god that was ruthless here's the process you um you make a sauce and then you marinate the tempeh in the sauce um and then you put it in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes oh [ __ ] and then you just cut it cut up my tempeh put it on the side um i just cleaned this container in the most disgusting way like it still has remainder of sauce in it but the thing is like okay it just had the same thing in it like i'm just making the same thing it's not like flavors are gonna get mixed together that don't belong together here's how you make amazing tempeh sauce you are going to need peanut butter sesame oil ginger powder soy sauce and sriracha maple syrup and i believe that that's it oh wait no lime juice okay you're gonna take two spoonfuls of peanut butter one two one tablespoon of sriracha two tablespoons of sesame oil i think two tablespoons of lime juice three tablespoons of soy sauce take your ginger powder wow sprinkle a decent amount of ginger powder in there maple syrup and take a heaping that was probably two tablespoons and i mix okay so now i have this nice creamy sauce it's not really that creamy it still kind of has chunks in it and then i take the tempeh throw it in cover all the pieces and i take the dirty lid that i used the last time i made this and i put it right up is that gross so now i let this marinate for 12 to 24 hours cook it in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes comes out beautifully golden brown and then i eat it by itself i eat it in stir fries i eat it with other veggies like a little you know one of those like buddha bowls nourish bowls whatever the [ __ ] they're called this is it if you're vegetarian or vegan and you need some protein that was your recipe of the day and i hope you enjoyed it hey bestie um it is now the evening time i have been in bed for many hours um what have i been doing watching tick tocks and guess what i shouldn't be doing that because i told myself i was gonna stop but we fail we're human think for the rest of the evening i'm going to watch more tick tocks get ready for bed and then go to bed i'll probably go downstairs and have a few snacks and that's kind of my evening routine but let me tell you it's not interesting but i hope you enjoyed hanging out with me today nail check i'm obsessed with these i hope you enjoyed hanging out with me today love you guys so much i love you you're my bestie thank you for hanging out with me that's all i got me like doing anything to show off my nails you're my you're my bestie i love you so much i'm drinking herbal tea it's actually wow it says give love get love give love get love anyways i love you guys so much thank you for watching how many times do i have to say that before i just [ __ ] turn the camera off here's your forehead kiss i kind of went in for it a little sideways today have an amazing rest of your day an amazing evening if you're about to go to sleep i hope that you sleep tight if you're halfway through the day or it's the morning i hope that the rest of your day is amazing forehead kiss i love you so much uh good [Music] [Applause] [Music] night [Music] [Applause] [Music] you

-emma chamberlain",2021-02-21T19:27:27Z,321322,8365257,9132,good morning it is seven in the morning guess what we're doing today ultimate fast food breakfast tastiness [Music] guys it's seven in the morning i woke up at 6 30 after actually getting a terrible night's sleep like i've been getting great nights of sleep recently not last night no awful you guys may know the drill by now you may not there's no wrong answer i have this series on my channel where i taste test fast food and i try to find the best fast food option out there so let's say we're doing french fries i go and i test all the french fries from all the different fast food places and i tell you which one's the best or maybe i do veggie burgers i've done that the goal here is i try them all so that you don't have to let's say you've been getting going to burger king for the past 10 years and you refuse to try anything else but what if i go to burger king i taste test their veggie burger i say this [ __ ] sucks the wendy's one is super fire see now you know that you need to try something new today i'm going to be determining what fast food place has the best breakfast now i'm just generalizing breakfast which one has the best breakfast in general i'm not going to do like breakfast sandwich blah blah because some places just don't have a breakfast sandwich simple as that also the fact that i'm going to eat at seven in the morning is not easy for me because i don't really like eating until like 10 in the morning usually when i do these the answers surprise me like it's never like what i expected sorry it is seven in the morning i don't think i'm ready to talk yet do you guys mind if we just like smile and vibe this morning okay i'm ready i just had to warm up our first stop is mcdonald's we're going to be trying mcdonald's breakfast first they have the breakfast sandwich that looks like pretty much the only thing that they have so this is gonna be interesting can i do the bacon egg and cheese do you guys do iced black coffee actually can i add hot cakes i think i ordered too much thank you have a good one all right here we go mcdonald first we have a bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle i will be taking off the bacon because i'm a vegetarian i know this isn't the most i'm not happy to do this but there's no bacon on this side a mcgriddle why does it smell like maple syrup what even is a mcgriddle holy [ __ ] a mcgriddle is not what i expected literally it tastes like two maple soaked pancakes with bacon egg and cheese for me just egg and cheese it's not bad but it's definitely weird so i'm gonna need to think about that try their coffee pretty terrible okay now let's try their pancake although i feel like it was pointless for me to get a pancake because the mcgriddle is literally 50 pancake okay it comes with a bunch of like syrup and stuff but i'm not going to waste any time i know if i just drench it in syrup it's going to taste better so i want to try it for what it really is pancake let's give it a go obviously it would taste better dressed up right because right now it's just kind of so if i added the syrup the butter all that would taste better mcdonald's hot cakes get a 7 out of 10. the only thing is they're a little bit chewy in a way that's like unfamiliar for a pancake for me like i've never had a pancake that was chewy like that but i'll give them a seven now for the mcgriddle number one you have the bread which is basically a maple soaked pancake i'm impressed by this the flavor of it is super good and i like the salty and sweet with this sweet mcgriddle whatever that [ __ ] means but next we have the egg i'm sorry but the egg has a terrible texture and the last layer the american cheese which i hate if it was cheddar or something of that sort you would have me sold regardless i'm giving the mcgriddle sandwich a six out of ten i think it would have been better if i would have gotten a real breakfast sandwich that was like a a biscuit of sorts but overall i'm gonna give mcdonald's breakfast a 7.5 out of ten i definitely can picture myself going there and doing a full feast doing like the whole hash brown thing we already know their hash browns are good i didn't need to try them the coffee is bad but it's not the worst you're probably wondering oh my god i can't wear that i am not cute enough for that today you're probably wondering emma how did you pay for your food just now with my current debit card thank you to current for sponsoring this video i love you current is the new way to bank it's the future of banking it's a mobile bank with a visa card as you can see here current gets you paid up to two days faster current is actually a real bank account with no hidden fees and no minimum requirement or whatever that thing is no minimum balance requirement i don't know how money works yet i probably spend too much of it but you know what the reason why i love current is because if i pay using the card i'm redeeming points that i can then redeem for cash current works with apple pay venmo google pay cash app venmo do i say venmo i can't ever remember all the different payment sites it's too much one of my favorite things is that you can deposit checks using the camera on your phone so much easier no need to go to the bank and do all this complicated stuff i hate that i hate that they also have accounts for people under 18. so if you're feeling like you need a bank account you're under 18 current's got your back it takes two minutes to sign up card ships for free you need a bank and you want it to be easy go to current link in my description check out current thank you current for sponsoring this video back to the fast food and the fun although my tummy already is starting to hurt and we've only been to one place we're off to burger king but let's chat it's 7 30 in the morning and i love this time of the day the early morning's so amazing in la because there's no one around nobody to bother me it's also so empty like there's no lines for anything because everybody in la is lazy and doesn't want to wake up earlier than noon which i get it literally the first year and a half that i lived in la i did not wake up earlier than 11 a.m and i don't really know why that is i mean i think it's because i was like pulling all-nighters and you know staying up super late but something about la the energy is like stay up really late at night wake up really late in the afternoon vibe that actually made me quite uh depressed so i wouldn't really recommend doing that i mean then again if it works for you and it doesn't make you depressed go for it but you just don't get a lot of daylight you know what i mean it's like you wake up at noon and it's dark by five and you're like i literally feel like i just woke up two hours ago and now it's dark glad to spend my morning with you this morning eating fast food breakfast which i know for a fact i y'all i got a sensitive stomach and i'm just i always get scared every time i do these because i'm like what's gonna happen to my digestion also did i pass the wendy's no i did not okay i got scared that i passed the wendy's i didn't so wait where is the wendy's did i pass it if i pass it oh no it's right there okay sorry sorry for the freak out wendy says no line that already adds a point for me can i do a side of season potatoes bacon egg and cheese biscuit thank you thank you okay so apparently we're doing a bacon egg and cheese morning which is funny because i'm a vegetarian although i did used to eat bacon as a kid here and there because it was pretty good but maybe i'll try the bacon they won't kill me this is for science this isn't like i'm not i'm putting myself second here i'll try the bacon just so that you guys can know if it's a good sandwich cause i care about you i love you babe are we dating sometimes i feel like we're dating thank you so much have a good one oh yeah you're right did i almost leave my card with them yes yes i did i love how quick fast food is it's almost like dangerous how quick it is it's like how is it that fast oh my god there's somebody in their car but i don't care number two wendy's wendy's check bacon egg and cheese biscuit thing and breakfast potato wedges these are like a thicker fry so first we're trying the breakfast potato i love these i'm gonna give these a seven out of ten i've always loved the breakfast potato seasoning they nailed that here i wish that it was a little bit crispier but i'm still giving them a seven out of ten because i love breakfast potatoes so much and i think i have like i don't know i'm obsessed with them for some reason next we're trying the bacon egg and cheese okay i'm impressed by this egg like this egg actually doesn't look like a microwaved egg like it actually has like the different the white and the yolk are clearly separate let's give it a go wendy's wow wendy's this is getting a 9 out of 10 for me this is [ __ ] impressive the biscuit is so light and buttery and so perfect the egg is cooked to perfection and it's actually like a whole egg it doesn't look like just microwaved egg mix like it actually is an egg like the yolk and the white are separate like they cracked a [ __ ] egg the cheese i'm never a fan of american cheese we know that and then i did get a little bit of bacon in my mouth and it tasted great okay so sorry wendy's i'm giving you an eight out of ten your breakfast potatoes are not perfect but your breakfast sandwich is pretty darn good people are sleeping on wendy's because they have good fries normally i didn't their breakfast potatoes were a little bit dry but whatever their breakfast to me nine out of ten or did i say eight out of ten i don't know my brain does not work at this hour it's 7 30. we're burger king now we're at burger king now i report we're at burger king now french toast sticks bacon egg and cheese croissant thank you see i'm kind of going all over the map here because here's my idea if i just choose a random breakfast item off the menu it could be their worst or their best breakfast item but that's not my fault as a consumer i'm going to burger king i'm going to mcdonald's i'm going to wendy's and i'm putting my trust into the brand if i accidentally order the worst thing on their menu guess whose fault that is not mine my tummy hurts i just farted but you couldn't hear it but yeah i'm kind of hurting god they have a [ __ ] breakfast burrito here i should have gotten that but you know what i think we're gonna go to taco bell it's like they'll do a breakfast burrito probably better than [ __ ] burger king would although you never know with this stuff you really don't thank you so much have a good one we're in a very dark parking spot the lighting's terrible there's an old man next to me staring at me he probably doesn't understand the concept of what i'm doing right now i don't blame him let's do this [ __ ] burger king number one we have french toast sticks they smell really good i'm excited yeah these are pretty [ __ ] good i might have to give these an 8 out of 10. if i dip these hoes in syrup i do wish they were a little bit more cinnamony but i mean the texture's crazy it's like crunchy on the outside soft tender chewy on the inside french toast sticks eight out of ten bacon egg and cheese croissant as you can see burger king is doing more of the not as okay so wendy's did more of like a natural looking egg that like look like you actually cracked the egg open burger king and mcdonald's are doing more of this egg block we'll try it okay i really like the croissant but my only issue is the lack of flavor here the cheese isn't really cooked all the way through so it's kind of still a little bit gelatinous the egg absolutely has no seasoning on it there's no seasoning at all it's just an egg it has no flavor at all the bacon is just tastes like [ __ ] bacon i don't know and then it's just american cheese the only thing that makes it stand out is the croissant but i bet other places have a croissant one too like i don't know i'm gonna give this like a five out of ten it's just a little bit sad and the other options are so much better i'm gonna give burger king breakfast a six out of ten so that's what i'm gonna leave you with so right now we have what i literally could not tell you what i've rated everything else i gave burger king what a nine oh my god i don't know okay we're literally gonna rewatch my footage and find out what i rated everything did my tripod just break correct it did the show must go on i don't know how the show's going to go on because my tripod is so flimsy but we're gonna figure it out i just rewatched all of my footage of how i rated everything and i really kind of said a different number every time i brought something up but i think i have the basic idea in the lead we have wendy's coming in a close second is mcdonald's and number three is burger king right now this could change this is subject to change we still have three more places to go to anything could happen so now we're headed to chick-fil-a i don't even know if chick-fil-a has a breakfast sandwich that well because i don't eat chicken that's something i will not i will not eat chicken bacon if it ends up in a sandwich [ __ ] it i'm eating it sure chicken i don't eat my tripod being broken really threw a wrench into these into this today you know what i might just have to i might have to hold this for the rest of the life is not easy because well life is not easy for many reasons but it's especially not easy for me right now because my tripod just broke i'm not going to let that stop me if that means i have to hold you guys right here for the rest of the video and make my arm tired i will i can't see i can't see because of you i can't see because of your truck see that guy see that truck right there you should yell at them because i can't [ __ ] see what did we learn today ladies and gentlemen number one don't ever film a youtube video before 10 in the morning because i don't think i've made one cohesive sentence why why though we're going to chick-fil-a next and i feel like people talk about their breakfast like i feel like their breakfast is definitely notorious so i'm going to anger a lot of people today when i don't get a chicken sandwich and when i probably give them a low rating but you're only as good as your worst menu item i know it's a hard pill to swallow although that's a terrible way to live life because the way that i live my life and the way i judge myself is emma you're only as good as your worst mistake and i haven't made that many bad mistakes in my life but i'm definitely embarrassed of quite a few things and that's how i define myself and that's what i look at in the mirror don't do that this only applies to restaurants the the you're only as good as the worst thing on your menu this does not apply to humans usually unless you're like a murderer is that chick-fil-a you're kidding me oh my god okay i just took like a weird way like i went away that i normally don't go and i [ __ ] ended up right here i love myself you're only as good as how quickly you find the chick-fil-a i sometimes i wonder if i'm cut out to be a youtuber because it's like emma bare minimum bare minimum have a tripod that works i know i know i shocked myself too there is no line at the drive-through oh wait is chick-fil-a closed it is okay why it's not sunday it's tuesday so chick-fil-a's not happening but you know what i feel like chick-fil-a was going to be a bust anyway and i was going to falsely rate them everybody was going to be mad at me so i'm glad i'm kind of glad that we've avoided that one where are we going taco bell i've actually never tried any of these fast food breakfasts except for mcdonald's hash browns that's the only thing i've tried but those are [ __ ] insane i mean those are fire like nobody can say that those aren't good one of those things that i'm pretty sure everybody agrees on you can't even really fight about it mcdonald's hashbrowns are good anybody who says that they're not hater or they're allergic to taters that was kind of funny i think taco bell's gonna have a more unique kind of situation i don't think that they're gonna go the breakfast sandwich root if i'm lucky they're gonna go the breakfast burrito root i am a huge breakfast burrito gal i actually had a phase um probably two years ago where i would eat the same breakfast burrito every morning i don't think it was good for my health but it was great for everything else oh my god there's jack in the box right there should i just run in there and get breakfast oh random but random spontaneous but fun yes i am gonna have to cut over like six lanes though which makes me very nervous please let me in please let me and please let me and please let me in please let me and please let me in [ __ ] god damn it i missed the jack in the box y'all i feel ill though it's jack-in-the-box time do they even have breakfast let's find out they do have breakfast and it's served all day no way grilled sourdough swiss uh does that come with a hash brown thank you so so far jack in the box has had the most interesting breakfast sandwich sourdough and swiss cheese sandwich i do feel a little bit of guilt that i did just get a jack-in-the-box hash brown wow i neglected to order that from mcdonald's i i genuinely feel this like impending doom and guilt but i have to stay true to the moral of this video and i've said it enough times i don't have to say it again you're only as good as your worst men you're only as good as the worst thing as good as the worst thing on your menu jack-in-the-box first let's try their hash brown i'm just gonna do it while i'm driving interesting it's not as good as mcdonald's it's very very greasy maybe needed to be drained or pat it off a little bit more and it's also not salty enough so i think i'd give the hash brown a 6.5 out of 10 because it's still really delicious it's just not as good as mcdonald's and it's a little bit too oily and it's a little bit not salty enough next we have the sourdough breakfast sandwich this breakfast sandwich oh it has some sort of scary meat in it so i'm gonna pick that off this one is like the largest it looks the prettiest there is some sort of weird meat in it though that i will be removing right now um smells delicious so let's give it a go okay well the cheese is just american cheese again i mean like they just love using wait i thought this was supposed to be a swiss sandwich oh there is swiss cheese right here well you can't really taste it because there's also american cheese on this side i mean i guess i tasted a little bit the sourdough bread also doesn't taste like sourdough at all the way that they cook the eggs kind of brings them back up a few notches i'm gonna give jack in the box a 6.8 out of 10. i feel like i'm gonna poop my pants oh we have one more place to go too i feel sick i literally just why does that dude look just like david dobrik i was literally about to be like yo dobie it wasn't him my hands smell like so many different things right now also my hair is so dirty y'all like my hygiene recently like i know i used to make jokes like about how i don't shower i genuinely haven't been showering as much as i should actually that's not true i'm showering but i'm just not washing my hair i've been just like desperate for anything that will make me feel relaxed these days because i feel like my anxiety is just so bad so i was like you know what i'll meditate [ __ ] it so i meditated and i actually felt pretty good i know it's crazy i never thought i'd be that guy that's like guys meditating makes my day so much better but here i am being that guy we're almost at taco bell i'm kind of sad that this is over but i'm also so glad because i i don't know how many more i could do is it right here where the [ __ ] is it talk about oh it's right there got it hi do you guys have like a a burrito like what's your breakfast burrito okay cool i'll do the burger i'll get that i'll do the green sauce today i couldn't really understand what he was saying so i think i accidentally got a breakfast crunch wrap and a breakfast burrito thank you so much last but not least taco bell i'm actually most excited about this one for some reason i couldn't tell you why first we have a burrito i'm kind of afraid because i don't really know what's in this because i really don't know what i ordered okay that's what it looks like it looks kind of gross but we're gonna try it okay i hate the tomato but as a breakfast burrito connoisseur this is pretty damn good everything has a nice flavor everything melts together it's not under seasoned i'd easily give it an 8 out of 10. considering what it is like you're not going to like it it's taco bell right so it's not going to be the best breakfast burrito you ever ate in your life taco bell crunchwrap breakfast crunchwrap though again i have no idea what's in this this looks like it's pretty much the same thing this might have to be a 9 out of 10. it has this spicy sauce in it that's just unbelievable taco bell you have impressed me i'm going to give the crunchwrap an 8.8 out of 10. i'm going to give taco bell an 8.6 out of 10. no you know what i'm going to give it an 8.5 out of 10 and i'm going to tie it with wendy's and we have our final list ladies and gentlemen the results are in coming in first place actually coming in tied for first place is taco bell and wendy's coming in a very close second place is mcdonald's in third jack in the box and in fourth burger king i'm gonna get up close and personal with you guys this morning and give you guys kind of my final thoughts if you're in the mood for a killer hash brown head your way to mcdonald's they might have a good breakfast sandwich but i'd maybe stay away from the mcgriddle i think you could do better if you're in the mood for the best breakfast sandwich you're going to find you might want to go to wendy's and you might want to get that biscuit breakfast sandwich because that thing might change your life and why not get the breakfast potatoes while you're at it if you want some good french toast sticks head to burger king but skip the breakfast sandwich on the way out go to taco bell get the breakfast crunch wrap that thing has some jalapeno crema goddamn thing in it or get the burrito and just say no tomatoes unless you like tomatoes because you're sick in the head go to jack in the box for a very oily hash brown long story short you can't really go wrong with any of them they're all kind of good and they're all kind of bad i give you my ranking you can do with it what you want and i love you all and thank you for watching and hanging out with me this morning it is now 8 30 in the morning and i'm stuffed and i'm going to go lay in bed for the rest of the day and i love you and thank you for hanging out with me every single week um you guys are awesome so beautiful so sexy so perfect don't forget that you're that [ __ ] okay i love you all have an amazing day and follow your dreams [ __ ] okay bye you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-02-14T18:11:08Z,268725,5175513,11086,hi why am i wearing this in like every video [Music] chamberlaincoffee.com oh my god also we just released decaf on chamberlain coffee.com so if you are not somebody who likes caffeine if you like to drink coffee past 8 p.m but you can't handle the caffeine at that hour because nobody really should be able to whatever it may be decaf coffee is now available on chamberlaincoffee.com and honestly it's something that i should be drinking right now because i'm on my period being a period welcome to today's video where we're going to be addressing a problem that i have not seen many people address i am somebody who struggles with a bad period i was in bed the whole day yesterday when i know you the whole day like i did not leave my bed once sometimes you need to get out of the house even when you even when you're on your period but the question arises what the [ __ ] are you supposed to wear when you're on your period because yesterday my cramps were so bad that i was like i don't even know what i'd wear right now if i had to leave the house like i what if i had to look good right now and the thought of having to pick out an outfit with those cramps going on was like stressing me out and i was like i wonder how many women are like stumped on how to feel like they're dressing cool trendy and fun while on their period because all you want to wear is loose clothes so today i'm going to be teaching you how to look like a baddie even when you're on your period we're gonna do a fun period inspired makeup look a few outfit ideas for how to dress when you're on your period you're all cramped up you're uncomfortable etc etc the makeup look will also be waterproof due to the fact that when i'm on my period all i can really seem to do is cry and be stressed out and if you're one of the people out there that doesn't have painful periods number one i would say [ __ ] you that's like what my body is inclined to say but i also understand that happy for you period friendly outfits period friendly makeup something that nobody is talking about because when you're on your period i feel like that's the time when you need to feel like a baddie the most when i'm on my period i hate myself i look in the mirror i'm like wow you are so ugly i can't be the only one and so being able to get ready in a way that makes you feel comfortable is a good thing let's begin as you can see i've been in bed for over 24 hours now and it's showing like the back of my hair is a full mat but i'm gonna teach you how to get ready exactly from this point no need to even shower sometime oh my god i'm gonna show you guys wait you guys are going to [ __ ] freak out about this i don't know if you guys are going to judge me or if you guys are going to be like wow i mean you're [ __ ] onto it i have a hack for you to start this video this is not okay so this is not good like don't do this like obviously the best option is a shower but sometimes your mental health is [ __ ] up sometimes you whatever and you need to like go out quickly but you don't want to smell bad i don't know if this is a good tip isopropyl alcohol wipes you wipe your armpit it kills all the bacteria in your armpit makes your armpits smell fresh and clean and new you put deodorant over it and it's like you showered it listen it doesn't work it does not replace a shower but i understand that in quarantine and things like that sometimes you just can't make ends meet it also works really well if it's summer and like you shower but then and you put on deodorant and all that and then it's just like you sweat through your deodorant really quickly use one of those wipes i don't know if that's okay for your skin but um the first thing we're gonna talk about here are ladies and well i guess just ladies but you could totally be a gentleman and watch this the first thing we need to fix is our hair and this is my go-to period hairstyle so first we're going to brush out our very tangle and very oily hair great it's already looking up from here you're going to want to take your dry shampoo just really get in there right this adds some volume and makes your hair look like you did shower within the past week my hair looks so [ __ ] awful like this what i've been doing is just going into a [ __ ] clip okay all you do is you take your clip you clip it in you scruff it up a little bit and you call it a day you're so welcome you couldn't have figured that out on your own i bet see watching my videos you can't say i don't teach you anything you are welcome moving on to makeup okay oh my god my [ __ ] this room is a mess i think the key on your period is is to go light just because if you're like me you're probably already kind of breaking out from being on your period although i didn't really break out this period but instead i just got the worst cramps i've ever had step one i'm gonna want you to take your foundation of choice you guys already know my product of choice so this is just not necessary i normally do like my actually everyday makeup look now has become a little bit more heavy because like i do a lot of eye stuff like i do a lot to my eyes and i was like you know what i don't feel like i need to do that anymore when i'm on my period lightly apply your foundation now the reason i say lightly apply is because who knows what's going to happen you could start crying at any given moment decide that like you just need to be in bed literally last night my cramps were so bad i couldn't even get out of bed to brush my teeth so like you kind of always have to be ready to be bedridden okay now we have a light layer of a base on there we're going to add our infamous lip plumper because when we are on our periods we want affection a lot so we want to make our lips look nice and hydrated and juicy so that somebody will want to kiss us while we're on our period okay now that we've done that we're going to add a little bit of concealer you probably haven't been sleeping very well so put a little extra more than normal the way that i blend my concealer changes every day we're gonna powder now this but things i know this is also obvious like okay you just did [ __ ] foundation and concealer yes but we'll get to the to the big kicker okay okay we're gonna lightly bronze our face take a big brush it doesn't matter for me a little bit of bronzing just really like adds some definition to my face so that i don't feel like a toddler now you're gonna take this an eyeshadow brush and the same bronzer put it on your eyelid you don't even need to [ __ ] blend it in nobody's gonna see it take a highlighter you're gonna get it all over your brush nose cheek messy i don't even care you don't care you're in your period you don't care you have other things bigger things to worry about your whole vagina is bleeding off and now my video is probably gonna be demonetized but youtube if you do monetize me for saying that you don't care about women and then we're gonna take some brow gel i am not going to fill in my brows today because the thought of it doing something with precision is out of the goddamn question last but not least mascara you're going to want to use waterproof i [ __ ] ran out of waterproof mascara ladies let's do a little game called act like emma's putting on waterproof mascara i mean waterproof mascara isn't like a crucial point i mean i actually usually cry more before that's not necessarily true i cried yesterday a lot there's actually no activities that are good for your period because like standing up in general is just not okay i guess like what watching a movie i get bored when i watch movies i can't watch a movie by myself who am i supposed to ask questions about the plot too i don't like movies actually i like movies like sometimes i like them the only ones i watched by myself were when i was really single and i was in love with timothy xiaomi because he was like my muse because i like had to like kind of fill a void before i found another guy to date so i watched those movies by myself and i don't know if i want to keep this in the video uh last step if you've been in bed for 24 hours and you haven't left bed to take care of yourself you probably have eye boogers so remove those um now you can optionally add a lip product i'm just gonna add a little bit of lip gloss this product is actually also a lip plumper i literally just added two lip plumpers to my lips see this is what living in la does to you so we're done we're done with hair and makeup and now for the finale i'm going to show you sorry i literally was having a cramp like this is i wish i was [ __ ] with you i bled through a super tampon last night all over my bed wow oh i need to take a little break actually because i'm having a little you know they come in waves um i'll be back now we've arrived at the part that we've all been waiting for the outfit so i would say the key is loose pants pretty much looking as cool as you can while not squeezing your uterus and on that note let's get started with the outfits we'll see how many i can do before i need to lay back in bed again outfit number one so here's my thought process here the main event of this outfit is these pants these have been not only my go-to on my period but also my go-to off my period they are like an elevated yoga pant it's like a little bit cooler than a yoga pant [Music] god the echo is bad and you add the little doc martin you add a little boot and everybody's like damn she has her [ __ ] together you add a cute little zipper that has skulls on it to prove hey everybody maybe don't mess with me right now you had some big sunglasses to hide your emotions you add a cheetah print bag to distract people from the chaos that's ensuing on the rest of your body and it's just like boom next so we're using the same pants because it's important to be efficient when you're on your period to be honest there's probably only going to be five pants in our closet during our periods that we're going to want to wear maximum so if you find a pair of pants that works just reuse reuse reuse recycle so we're wearing these again and we'll probably wear them a few more times too unfortunately we have some color going on to prove that we're happy we're having fun but we also have a little bit of leather to show listen don't [ __ ] with me vibes but also like not in a violent way because you don't want to like go to jail but anyway a nice big oversized turtleneck sweater is perfect because it just covers everything you just feel safe and warm and secure in this a little color coordination never hurt anybody whatever call the police on me this is it this is number two i don't look like i'm on my period right now it's about fooling the masses frankie stop you're gonna [ __ ] fall off the balcony you idiot outfit number three nothing like a cute little graphic tee to make people think that you're emotionally stable i took this cute little graphic tee threw it over this extremely loud turtleneck paired it with the red pants that i've been wearing for the past two outfits this is also extremely comfortable and they look stylish to a certain extent some people might think this outfit's extremely ugly which i understand but i'm very comfortable again nothing is squeezing my abdomen region i feel great the more extreme you are with your outfit the more you're going to fool people into thinking that you have your [ __ ] together and that's the key outfit number four it's time to start styling jeans now i know we said earlier and i said earlier that like wearing jeans is like not an option it is it's just not easy you have to wear jeans that are very loose i have put on a schoolboy outfit i feel great added this little collar to make it seem like i'm smart logical and rational when in reality it feels like i'm none of those things on my period i also added this little messenger bag so that i could put my tampons in here oh i put it on backwards see also all these outfits are fun and cute like it's not like they're bad you don't have to you can dress to impress on your period don't give up on yourself next we're literally going back to basics we're wearing the jeans with a little loafer boot chunky cropped sweater but not so cropped that you feel exposed but just cropped enough where it hits the top of your pants with a nice big jacket you can use any big jacket that you'd like done life is really so simple when you just add a big oversized jacket i mean really good out of any big oversized jacket yes you could wear this by itself but this is extremely boring and also i don't feel like i'm being surrounded by a warm layer of clothes to protect my uterus which is crucial this sweater makes me feel like my breasts are being okay you know what i think i'm getting a little too open we won't talk about my boobs on the internet outfit number six um i'm running out of things to say but i think you get the gist of it by now the pants are loose it's comfortable number seven we're in the yoga pants so i'm literally wearing some lululemon yoga pants okay then i'm wearing a fun long sleeve graphic tee i put a cute oversized zip up on top it's simple but let me tell you is it effective but i look a little bit goth and a little bit fun i don't look off um people are gonna hate on me in the comments also like adding big sunglasses come on you would i look fun and this is basically a warning sign being like you know i'm not afraid to yell today i'm not afraid to ask the manager to take back my food next this is my favorite thing to do with yoga pants you take the yoga pants you take a turtleneck and you take a crew neck and you put it over top done i feel like i could go to bed in this outfit it looks so put together though i have these little accessories that really just make it even better yoga pants elevated number nine i don't even i don't know we're still wearing a turtleneck that's white we're still wearing our yoga pants we're still very comfortable but we've added a sweater vest this just makes it look so cool but it's still loose it's so comfy whatever i don't know what else you can ask for i'm gonna do one more outfit and it's gonna be the perfect sweatpant outfit the grand finale is the ultimate sweatpant period fit check fit check yeah hey guys i am in bed i am on my heating pad and i was actually thinking a big part of being on your period is eating right number one you're hungry constantly or at least i am so why don't we do like a period friendly snack recipe so i did some research on like what foods are good to eat when you're on your period so some of the foods that i found that are good for when you're on your period were chocolate avocado leafy greens chia seeds i mean the list goes on but i was like what if i found a recipe online for brownies that have avocado in it and i found a recipe so i was thinking right now me and you me and you you're my bestie me and my bestie which is you could go downstairs and make some avocado brownies this could be really gross this could go really bad and if this ends up being a good recipe then this could be a great go-to period snack slash dessert but anyway let's make these brownies okay here's what we're gonna need i got this recipe from a website called sweet as honey set your oven to 350. you're gonna need a whatever this is some avocados you're gonna need chocolate chips you are going to need coconut oil oh no coconut oil maple syrup or your sweetener choi oh that's what broke you guys what is going on i'm a mess what the [ __ ] just happened i can't two eggs almond flour baking soda salt and vanilla extract now let's get into it we're gonna put all of our wet ingredients in here okay this avocado i'm pretty sure is rotten because i've had some of these in my fridge for like literally two months no it's perfect damn okay about two cups of avocado they say so i'm just gonna wing it put that in here squeeze second one in here this recipe sucks and i just wasted three avocados and i'm gonna be [ __ ] depressed about that now we're gonna add the coconut oil two tablespoons of coconut oil and we're gonna add the remainder of this [ __ ] maple syrup that's literally like oh what if i get glass hopefully i don't get glass we'll see i'm going to try to scoop the maple syrup off of my counter so let's just scoop that on up we're going to add the vanilla extract i'll just add a little dash i'm not going to measure it because i'm going to [ __ ] i'm going to crack an egg two eggs in here i'll add the cocoa powder later okay i feel like this is good i'm still learning with cooking i'm not perfect at it yet okay but that worked pretty [ __ ] well yes yes i've already made a huge mess one part about cooking being my new hobby like i just am so [ __ ] beyond messy that that's just the problem i'm gonna scoop this into a abnormally large bowl scoop all of this guacamole this is kind of grossing me out to be honest because it's like the base of my brownies should not be green we're going to take our almond flour i've been cooking so much recently and it's literally my favorite thing to do it has genuinely become my favorite hobby that i have but i make so much food i cook way too much for one person because i i enjoy doing it so much i'm constantly cooking but i can't eat all of it this makes me want to have kids just so i can feed them ah why am i dropping everything half of a cup of cocoa powder [ __ ] some salt vanilla extract baking powder but i feel like i should measure this one i hope baking soda doesn't go bad because i'm pretty sure i've had this baking soda for about five years okay let's try a little bit of this oh my god ew there's a green i mean it tastes [ __ ] good chocolate guacamole everybody line up now i'm gonna take a paper towel watch this fun fact in half some of you might think this is disgusting but i don't care so you're gonna take a spoon this one's very dirty i'll clean the spoon here okay fold that onto the inside take my spoon take a little bit of coconut oil put it on the paper towel and then just rub grease the pan scoop your batter you can still see some green which means i didn't mix it enough i'm not i don't have the patience to do things perfectly right now try to make it as even as possible 25 minutes and i'll see you then it has been 25 minutes it looks done to me ow i just burned the [ __ ] out of my hand i hate my life yeah it it seems done enough i now have to let that sit but while i let it sit we're gonna make a decaf latte with the new sleepy sloth chamberlain coffee decaf blend look at the little slime because ever since i read an article about caffeine making period cramps and bloating worse i was like oh i'm gonna have to figure something out and it's perfect timing that the decaf blend is out it's already in my coffee machine i put it in there when the camera was off see like i feel like decaf is so it's like i frown upon it because i'm always like oh like what's the point without caffeine but there is a lot of points without caffeine because some people can't handle caffeine like me and i forget that i probably should be drinking less caffeine and i know that so this is like a good first step and especially on my goddamn period also does anybody else get the worst gas on their period like i just i don't not even like sorry do you know what nobody wants to hear about that nobody wants to hear about that i recently bought this toasted coconut milk and i'm very fascinated by it so let's try it out in our latte today sometimes my nut pods get frozen in my refrigerator and it doesn't make any sense because nothing else gets frozen in my refrigerator besides my nut pods and it doesn't make sense but sometimes i just like to put the little ice chunks in my coffee is that gross like look at my [ __ ] finger i'm literally like youtube is not gonna like what i just did to my nut pocket this towel is so disgusting just after the past hour the amount of things i've wiped up with it this needs to go in the trash probably but i like almond milk better but regardless it's still really good in this decaf it's really fooling me into thinking that i'm drinking caffeine when i'm not here's how our brownies turned out they look pretty good but we need to taste before we can be the joker wow it actually is holding together pretty well let's take a seat and taste it okay i don't like it i'd much rather just eat a normal brownie i love the concept right a snack that satisfies the chocolate craving of your period while also gives you added nutrients unfortunately i hate the flavor of it i'm still gonna eat it but i wouldn't recommend that you make it i also think you're better off just eating a normal brownie emma good job you tried um but i'm done for the day because i'm not gonna lie my cramps are bad and there's nothing i want to do more than lay in bed and on that note i love you guys thank you for hanging out with me oh emma's a chef now we can rely on her well you can't it's a tough pill for all of us to swallow and this wasn't my recipe this was somebody else's so i'm gonna blame it on that anyway i love you all so much thank you for watching and hanging out with me if you're on your period right now i'm praying for you i feel you girl um if you're not in your period well you probably will be soon so i feel bad for you for when you get it order a heating pad on amazon lay on that thing until it burns out and you need to buy a new one for forehead kiss for the road and i'm out of here cheers why is my almond milk so lumpy i'm gonna go bleed all over my bed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] bye

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-02-07T20:23:47Z,279954,5505141,10901,good morning chairmancoffee.com [Music] good morning everybody i'm vlogging again i am becoming a vlogger i didn't think that this would ever happen but i'm kind of loving it and kind of enjoying it the thing about me vlogging is that again i don't do anything interesting we know that but i don't really care it is 10 00 a.m i've been awake for three hours and i've just been in bed i made myself coffee i took my morning poop and then now here we are the funny thing is i wanted to start vlogging uh like probably two hours ago but i refused to turn the camera on before i had my morning poop i get so angry before my morning poop i'm not me before my morning poop most people are like don't talk to me before my morning coffee for me it's don't talk to me before i've had my morning poop and that's actually true like that's not even a joke and on that note uh let's get ready for the day i the only things i have on my schedule today are number one getting my nails done because finally things are starting to open up in la so i can get these bad boys done and then i also have so many groceries i bought so many groceries because i was like having this night where i just like found all these recipes i wanted to make and then i just like bought everything i ordered everything online because i do that i order my groceries online because i'm a [ __ ] and i don't want to go to the grocery store everything came and i was like wait a minute what did you just do and now i have so many groceries so we're going to cook today too whatever first we have to do a drum break that one needs a lot of work that one does need a lot of work you don't even have to [ __ ] tell me no [Music] i'm so sick of it because i sit at this goddamn stupid drum set every day and i'm still not that good like what the [ __ ] wait that i got it dude you know what it's all about believing in yourself everybody isn't serious did you guys see what happened it was like i did it i did it anyway i'm gonna try to look a little cute today like not like makeup on my face cute but like cute as in like pretty cute sorry you just had to watch all that now let's do skin care which actually leads us to our sponsor of today's video which is bad habits i am the creative director and global ambassador for the brand bad habit their skin care brand they really focus on embracing life's imperfections and they do their best to create products that make you feel good make your skin feel good that's that one of my favorite products i've been using recently is this hydrating hyaluronic mask this is just a leave-on mask that you use for a little bit and it keeps your skin nice and moisturized hyaluronic acid moisturizes your face it's great and it's super relaxing i use this all the time another favorite has been this hand cream recently it's the adaptogen nourishing hand cream this hand cream has helped me so much because i'm so dry and it also feels good it's not like oily and gross it's nice my favorite product of theirs oh i've two favorite this is the dude hemp nourishing facial oil it personally works with my skin so well just like lays over my skin so nicely and i love it and it just makes me feel hydrated and it makes me look glowy but my other favorite product is this total reboot aha bha enzyme peel and i use this a few times a week and it's an enzyme peel so it's kind of like a chemical exfoliant and it helps get rid of all that dead [ __ ] that's on your skin i'll probably use this later today so you'll probably see me use it but i love it with skincare it's really important for me because i was on accutane which is an acne medicine for seven months and now i still have to maintain my skin you know everybody's super different look into the ingredients of this stuff talk to a dermatologist and see if these products could work for you i've had a really great experience with them but again everybody's different bad habit is available at ulta morphe and online and i'll leave the links to everything in the description and i love bad habits now i'm going to apply their products to my face i'm just doing a little bit of the oil that has a hair on it a little bit of this daily dose multivitamin moisturizer my teeth are yellow i look like [ __ ] it's like oh [ __ ] it's like somebody give me a break you know what i mean what are we wearing today it's been freezing in l.a and it's been raining so we have to dress accordingly oh my god so recently i've been wearing these pants i have a red pair i have a black pair and i have like an ombre pair and they're these [ __ ] pants and they're like knit and they have a tie here they're from the brand img they're unreal some of the words actually i might wear these in black today i feel like i'm having that type of day i bought them in every color because they fit so well now what maybe a cute wait i don't know how to dress for the cold like i live in los angeles california where it never goes below 65 except for this week apparently because it's literally freezing i almost feel like i just wear a sweatshirt with it like a cool sweatshirt though i don't know if i even own a cool sweatshirt okay i could wear this shirt that i've already worn as you can see because it's inside out right now and that's my deodorant wait no

that's kind of cute rings i love this one okay we're gonna put that one on right here maybe one more gold one we'll do maybe this one i'll show you the rings i just got they're [ __ ] awesome this brand just sent me some of their beautiful jewelry they're all super colorful oh my god but look at these blue hoops wait these are [ __ ] fire i just like kind of don't know how to not overdo it with the jewelry like i'm constantly like i always wear a little bit too much those are cute though okay cute as [ __ ] hi [ __ ] things are a little bit out of control it's like are we doing a colorful jewelry or a gold no we need to fix this no that's [ __ ] cute am i overdoing it i mean i guess it doesn't matter honestly i just need to stop wait but this one no we're stopping wait that might actually be better because it's a little bit more subtle we're finishing it off with this one and we're not gonna question anymore should i add another one we're done we're done i just spent so much time picking up my accessories now it's time to leave look at us she is a perfect metaphor for women on their period she loves the attention and she'll like give you a little sniff give you a little ounce of attention and then she's like [ __ ] you [ __ ] also i'm looking at my outfit and i realized i might have went a little overboard but again it doesn't matter wait why is it bright and sunny out the [ __ ] weather forecast said rain i don't see one cloud in the goddamn sky also i just remembered i have no gas i literally hate getting gass i hate getting gas [ __ ] i'm literally going i'm driving between two cars right now and i'm gonna scrape at least one why the [ __ ] did you park your car in the middle of the road you stupid [ __ ] dumb idiot i am a sunglass hoarder that is the one thing that i swear like i need to stop purchasing but it's like i love sunglasses and since i was a kid i used to be obsessed with sunglasses i used to bulk order a bunch of crazy glasses off amazon and i would just wear them with my outfits and i thought that i was doing a thing i was like holy [ __ ] nobody's wearing glasses like me nobody is accessorizing like me truth be told i mean i wasn't really doing a thing i like literally got the yellow jake paul aviator sunglasses and thought that i was like changing the world i'm literally about to be out of gas like i'm about to my car is about to start rolling in the middle of the road my car is about to shut down i also think i smell stinky but that doesn't make sense because i showered last night wait it's fart time you guys must the second one was unexpected gas time my credit card just got declined what the [ __ ] at the gas station behind me i don't want to get a tesla because i feel like they're too complicated to use there's like party mode you know automatic driving mode it's just one big ipad that feels wrong but i also remember when the iphone came out i remember my mom wanted one and i was like this is so stupid and now everybody and their mom has an iphone including me so it's like probably shouldn't be judging the latest technology considering i'm not that smart so like why should i be the one to be like oh this is too complicated this is too futuristic this is stupid [Music] okay we're ready a lot of nail salons still aren't open yet so i do have to do a quick little 15-minute drive to find one i know it sounds so stupid it sounds very like okay emma like really your nails you care about your nails that much shut the [ __ ] up but for me self-care is not necessarily looking in the mirror and saying like you know positive affirmations although i do try to do that having my nails freshly done is one of the greatest joys in my life i think it's because number one i have to look at my hands a lot like you actually end up you you do look at your hands quite frequently and seeing a nice beautiful set of nails on your fingers just makes you feel put together it makes you feel it makes me weirdly feel like prettier is that like weird i don't know why but it makes me feel like more confident more like you know a beauty queen whereas when i have these like rough around the edges kind of dirty nails i'm just kind of like i don't feel as good about myself i'll see you at my nail appointment see this is the before see what we're working with here so i cannot wait to see what i end up getting wait what color should i get okay well we'll see love you okay wait i look like [ __ ] for one i also need coffee but i'm like 20 minutes away from home anyway that's beside the point right now let's talk about my [ __ ] nails they turned out so cute are you guys ready it matches the ring look how [ __ ] cute they're also like the perfect length because sometimes i get them too short on accident and then i'm like why'd i even get them done look up close i'm sending a picture my mom hold wacky i available think i want some tea i'm turning into a weirdo i never used to drink tea i never used to like i don't know i'm evolving so i think i'm gonna make a little mini veggie stir-fry with just broccoli and peppers in it i'm gonna put some a little drizzle of olive oil i have some pre-cut peppers because i'm a lazy piece of [ __ ] so we'll take a few of each put that in there then we're gonna take some broccoli i'm just gonna cut some yes this broccoli is washed no it's not i did prank you and i did lie it's good for my immune system it's building up my immune system so we're gonna cook this now on this pan for two to four minutes then i'm going to steam it lightly by adding a little bit of water and covering the veggies yes i'm a chef now i know it might be intimidating okay so we're just gonna let that sit for a second while we make our sauce okay so here's what we're gonna add and we're just gonna eyeball it sesame oil add a little actually a decent amount of that soy sauce okay sriracha which i've never really been that much of a fan of until i started cooking and then i realized that it actually is super handy in a lot of like recipes like sriracha actually really is low-key fire minced ginger like maybe that much now secret ingredient i'm gonna add a little bit of peanut butter which might seem weird i know probably like a tablespoon of that yes you can lick the fork if you live alone and yes you can take an extra spoonful for good luck i knew that was too much immediately when i did it we have our sauce mix it together again it's kind of funny because like i didn't measure any of this so it could either be really good or really bad that [ __ ] is spicy it's good though i'm gonna add a little bit of water to this now watch and learn cover it we're going to leave it for two minutes while i do that i'm going to use the mug that i just used to make tea heat up water take your tea of choice this one helps me poop we're going to put our tea bag in now we're going to take our lemon and we're gonna cut it i like a big nice lemon chunk in my tea i feel like it's probably been enough time of it steaming yeah it feels soft now we're gonna add our sauce and then we're gonna add our sesame seeds and then we're just gonna cook this a little longer really fold it around and make sure every single veggie got touched boiling water into my cup leave a little room for the lemon this is where we squeeze in the lemon this is where we drop the lemon inside we let the lemon sit okay i think this is probably done now we plate it up okay this is a dirty plate that i used last night but i rinsed it so i think it's fine i think i made well that's a lot of vegetables i'm gonna have a tummy ache after that but if you wanted to eat this as a meal and not just a snack you could add a protein source such as tofu tempeh chicken let's try it let's try broccoli first mmm very good let's try a pepper i'm genuinely impressed guys that's actually pretty good the peanut butter is a game changer definitely try that sauce and you can eyeball it you know bon appetit hey it's many hours later and i'm craving a dessert so i'm going to completely wing a recipe like i'm not gonna follow a recipe at all um so let's see what ingredients we have peanut butter baking gems basically chocolate chips i guess i do have some coconut okay i actually have more peanut butter because i feel like that's not enough maple syrup egg we'll go from there okay i guess this is gonna be some sort of a peanut butter cookie i'm literally gonna eyeball all my measurements which is not a good idea i'm just gonna spoon out the rest of this jar of peanut butter it's all trial and error i'm not gonna make a lot just in case this turns out bad i'm just in the mood to experiment maybe one egg because i don't feel like i need two because i don't feel like i have like that's not enough yeah right egg whisk the egg in it a little maple syrup for sweetness i'm gonna add some coconut randomly watch these be good i'm gonna be impressed coconut chocolate i'm nervous we'll mix it it's already a little bit soupy for my liking it really just clicked in my head that i just ate raw egg i didn't really think about that maybe a little baking soda no do you know what that's dangerous almond flour we'll add a little bit okay now let's see where we're at oh see this is a better consistency it's super thick sorry i should not be eating that that's like not good for me salmonella cheddar i didn't wash my hands but nobody's eating these but me guys i don't really cook desserts a lot because it's like seems like a waste of time but it is fun look how like rough i'm handling this [ __ ] because i'm the only one eating it i'm gonna flatten these down a little bit with the bottom of this peanut butter jar probably should have thought about that a little bit more before i did it putting some olive oil on the bottom of this so i can flatten these without it sticking oh oh it didn't work genius idea though i also could just use okay so i could have just used my hand got it i would love to tell you the recipe like i would love i'd love that like more than anything i couldn't tell you what i just made i don't know what this is i know i shouldn't be doing this i know that what i'm doing is naughty right now but this batter actually tastes really good you know what i should do is like try to make like oh my god that could be a fun okay brainstorming video video ideas okay youtuber let's see if i find a recipe online i go to the store and i pick out everything that i think is in it and i try to make it without looking at the recipe just by like context clues and like guessing that's a fun [ __ ] video and if anybody else has ever done it i don't care because i came up with it first it's actually my idea can you see that these genuinely look promising like i'm getting stoked and pumped i changed the lighting in here because i wanted it to be more more emo like almost like um christmas eve and i'm making cookies for santee i'm gonna give him some milk delicious would you guys be okay if we had a little cookie and chat over by the fireplace that i don't know how to turn on literally no one teaches you that stuff we have 52 seconds left on the clock of the cookies what do i do in the meantime emma do a tick-tock dance do you take down pants i don't do that stuff anymore i don't feel comfortable doing tik-tok dances anymore i mean i still do them but i used to actually take them seriously like i'd be like what was i thinking like i genuinely had a phase where i would genuinely do take talk dances and i thought i was kidding but are you [ __ ] with me these look hot okay hi and welcome to late night cookies and milk with emma i mean seriously how much more wholesome could this get okay we need to try this cookie for starters to see if it's even good it's pretty good i mean it's not great it's not bad it just started pouring rain outside oh [ __ ] that's fun i just wanted to thank you guys for watching this video i'm gonna go brush my teeth do my skincare routine do a little chemical peel and then i'm gonna go and tick-tock for about six hours maybe i'll hit the drums a few times and then i'm gonna go to bed but listen we've seen me do that a few too many times so i'll save you guys from that mess i think these need a little bit more maple syrup or maybe a banana added or something they're just a little bit savory in its defense i ate the whole thing anyway i love you guys thank you for watching thank you for hanging out with me today i love hanging out with you and i always feel like i'm [ __ ] like how do i explain this let's say like you're dating somebody in middle school and they come to you and they're like i don't feel like i'm getting enough affection from you and then you're like well i like you because you're nice to me and because you smell good when you come to school i like you because one time you let me borrow your pencil that's how i feel when i'm doing the outro my videos you guys are literally my middle school crush i do love you guys i like hanging out with you i like giving you forehead kisses [Music] that was so [ __ ] annoying i'll give you another one here's your forehead kiss for being my bestie and for staying to this point in the video and for watching me get my nails done even though it's super boring watching me get gas which is also boring this is for that i love you guys and sweet dreams or good morning or good afternoon and i will see you in my next video and i'm [ __ ] out of here [Music]

-emma chamberlain",2021-01-31T18:00:58Z,262384,5113157,6329,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good morning [Music] i literally look like a toddler wearing a winnie the pooh shirt with this fuzzy but i'm loving it i would kill for the toddler aesthetic not actually kill anyway i'm vlogging today before we start i need to get a few things out of the way number one look at my nails all the nail salons in la are closed once again and this is what we're working with listen i get it super stupid thing to complain hey you don't smell very good i think she just pooped oh my god she definitely just pooped it's like on her butt a little bit please leave chamberlaincoffee.com i already made my coffee sorry anyway uh my nails look like [ __ ] i ordered some stick-on ones just to like it'll do for now another elephant in the room oh emma why do you have a band-aid what happened let me tell you i would insert photos of what happened but i can't because i'm going to get to monetize last night i was cutting brussels sprouts minding my own business and i stabbed myself in the finger it wasn't like i like sliced my finger it was like i like was going like i was holding the brussels sprout like this right notice this finger right here i was holding it like this and then i went like cut down and then i pushed forward to like get to the get get like the last bottom part of it cut and i just stabbed straight into my finger and then it made me start to think like holy [ __ ] if stabbing my finger hurts this bad imagine getting stabbed to death i've been watching way too many murder documentaries but i did start to think about that and i was like holy [ __ ] that is so [ __ ] up and i knew it was [ __ ] up before but then it was like stabbing my finger really kind of was like food for thought for me um i don't think i'm allowed to show you this because i will get to monetize maybe i just give you a little today we are going to a flea market and we're gonna do some extreme vintage shopping i found this flea market in la last weekend and there's a flea market in la that like everybody goes to i don't like going to that one because there's too many people and it's too stressful i just get stressed there it's like disneyland but i found this other one that's like you know a little 30 minute drive away i went there last weekend it was unbelievable they had amazing vintage clothes and i was like okay let's do this let's make this a weekly thing a little weekly date with me it's like a date with myself but anyway i didn't shower i need to make myself look presentable without showering so that's going to be a fun challenge of the day drum break [Music] it just sounds like [ __ ] and sometimes i'll get it perfect and then it just oh oh that's it [Music] no you know what it's actually not my fault because my finger is injured so that's why it sounds like [ __ ] thank you anyway let's get ready this is what we're working with not good step one brushing my hair okay it's not oily so that really helps um i'm not in the mood to do my skincare this morning i don't feel like it it's like i did it last night do i have to do it this morning no uh maybe i should put on sunscreen probably won't though yeah okay wait i should probably do my skincare yes i have pepper spray on my counter don't ask oh i would not recommend washing your face with a band-aid on i feel like i need green tea today because i have redness constantly and then maybe a little bit of oil and then we'll do sunscreen i literally don't like putting on sunscreen like i know i need to be doing it teeth brushing tutorial um now i need to make me look relatively presentable and i'll explain why normally when i go and run errands it's like okay i don't care what i look like right there's a lot of cool and trendy people at these flea markets stylists just super trendy la girls like stuff like that so i like to look cool when i go to these things just to impress something i did last night was i took all of my pairs of jeans and i cut them to be the right length for my legs so it's almost like i have a bunch of new pairs of jeans this is one pair literally all you [ __ ] every time i hit my finger on something it hurts so bad so we're gonna wear these jeans because they're comfortable also considering these um maybe it's a sweater type of day because it's a little chilly out this jacket is cute this little red corduroy moment but what underneath hmm i know okay maybe i don't know oh [ __ ] i literally can't even look through my [ __ ] closet because every time something touches my cut it's so deep like i feel like i might have hit a nerve or something oh this top is really cute okay and i think that's the winner scratching the original plan this is what we're going with now all the trendy scary girls are not gonna they'll be like oh she wore jeans like she cares and i won't be bullied off to a good start my next thought process is do i make another coffee or not maybe we'll just put our existing coffee in a to-go container this togo container seems like it has rotten milk in it but we're ready we have a slight issue it is raining it's not raining anymore so we're gonna go see if they're open and if worse comes to worse and they're not open there's probably some cool vintage stores in the area oh my god they just looked online they're open let's send it i am coming out of a mental breakdown i had another one actually if you watched my last vlog you would see that i was having a mental breakdown in that video i ended up having a mental breakdown for like the next four days i just kept having breakdowns but today is the first day that i haven't had one it is only 9 45 in the morning though i weirdly want to start wearing [ __ ] that only makes sense to me i posted a photo on january 20th and everybody was like well it was a mixed review it was a mixed bag right like some people were like emma this is actually kind of cool randomly and some people were like emma this is the ugliest outfit i've ever seen that is exactly what i want at first it kind of stung a little bit i was like oh [ __ ] but like that's actually kind of what i think i want now and if i have a few people that are like emma [ __ ] you we hate this that's okay so that's my headspace and if you'd like to join me let's have fun let's just start wearing weird [ __ ] that doesn't make any sense i don't know where i mentioned this or how long ago i mentioned it six months ago if somebody would have asked me emma what's your favorite vegetable my answer would have been cauliflower and i do love cauliflower but my answer has changed to broccoli when you go to a [ __ ] restaurant and you order a side of broccoli the way that they're most likely going to cook it is disgusting most of the time they're going to take a piece of broccoli and they're going to throw it in boiling water for like five seconds and then they're going to take it out and it's going to be hard to eat it's going to be flavorless it's going to have the most gross chewy texture disgusting that is what society teaches us about broccoli well i'm here to tell you that don't ever believe that to be true and don't ever ex except thank you that poor quality of broccoli because broccoli now that i cook i know broccoli is one of the most delicious vegetables you make a delicious tahini sauce you toss your broccoli in it you roast it you eat it you transcend into a different dimension also somebody's literally pulling up next to me trying to watch me film and i just want to say [ __ ] you because you're literally ruining my day you [ __ ] idiot update it is now raining but we're gonna make it work i also need to talk about the fact that i haven't shaved my legs in a month and a half my jeans are rubbing up against my leg hair and it's so incredibly uncomfortable let's see if it's even open okay it's open are they packing up they better not be i'm literally gonna [ __ ] call the police this will ruin my day okay i have a good parking spot the rest is up to god it never rains here why why i mean they haven't said that they're not open so we're gonna head over there see what happens um update i did a little bit too much damage i'm going to drop everything off my car and then go back hands are free ready to go back and hit it again that's what she said and now i'm demonetized great just finished round two we definitely need to do a haul in the car why do i do this this is why i can't go shopping by myself because i don't have anybody to be like emma stop guys haul time guys i got a lot of [ __ ] [ __ ] first i got this brown velour short sleeve shirt velvet is like my favorite [ __ ] ever green sweater easy to throw over stuff because it's cropped boom chicka pow you feel me i regret saying that okay so this is a little mini red bag but get this it's mary kate and ashley a little vintage mary kate in ashley bag this is funny because this is literally a little boy's jacket it fit me somehow it's a leather jacket it's nice and light i don't care that this is a kid's jacket i [ __ ] with it a little boy old navy the reason why i bought this is because i remember so many kids in my class in elementary school like all the boys that i used to have crushes on would wear like little shirts like this with flames on the sides and i was like okay i'm gonna take inspo from that i also got this vest it had a cool like tag in it and so i got this zip up sweatshirt it has a little diamond on the front is this no base sweatshirt i don't even know next this cute sheer button up minty green beautiful top god i bought way too much stuff come on come on this was like ten dollars and it's like real wool and vintage pendleton so like [ __ ] it okay this was just like an impulse buy but i had to get it there's just a bunch of horses on it are they horses these are some fun pants they have this cool detail down the side check it check it this shirt that's black and it has like this pocket but then it also has like a pocket on the sleeve which to me gives me very 90s early 2000s vibe it reminds me of something that like hannah montana would have worn and that is enough to sell me on something this is super boring but i just like the shade of green and it's just like a cute little crop tea that i can wear with anything this i'm obsessed with this is so cute i feel like britney spears would have worn this this is the coolest top that i got it's kind of corny but like i just give me a minute why did i buy this wait i don't think i meant to buy this this is another basic tank top that i'm gonna wear with sweatpants every day of the week i got another leather jacket guys why did i do this like i literally did way too much this is a vintage guess leather jacket and last but not least this because i feel like this could be styled in a cool way and just give me a minute maybe with brown jeans what did we learn from this emma needs to stop shopping i need to clean up my closet maybe i'll do that today it's 11 30. it's only 11 30. look at how much damage i did before noon i did get slightly wet but actually it all dried i just had an idea chipotle just came out with cauliflower rice i want to know more about this because i'm a huge cauliflower rice stand it's just the best way to sneak in a little bit of veggie and i haven't been to chipotle forever because it gives me gas but i'm not going to see anybody today so let's [ __ ] up my bowels let's do this coldly cauliflower rice taste test 2021 let's give it a go it looks kind of boring and gross but cauliflower rice black beans vegetables fajita vegetables vegan meat and that's it let's try it tastes good though actually okay i just burned the [ __ ] out of my mouth okay see like all this green stuff in the cauliflower rice i hate i'm not a huge fan of that i think that moving forward i'm just gonna get the regular rice because it tastes better but it was a fun thing to try i'm gonna give it a six and a half out of ten i mean i'm still eating it so it can't be that bad six and a half out of ten bye i'm bored and i was like maybe i'll clean my closet so i tried to clean my closet but because of my finger injury every time i like try to pull something out of my closet and take the hanger off and all that it bumps my finger injury so closet will not be getting clean today instead i'm gonna be styling some of the new stuff that i just got i'm extremely fascinated by this top let's see what i can do with it um i did i put in the little betsy johnson bag are you kidding me i love this it is a little ugly but like it works next i styled this new leather jacket with this new tea tank that i just cropped why is it so [ __ ] dark i literally love doing this next we have this new sweater that i got little sweater vest you know what i'm dying in this little jacket with the same pants and it works fun right brace yourself for this next outfit everything is from the flea market i thrifted everything except for my shoes check it out are you kidding me today i was faced with the rain and i asked myself emma should you turn around and go home and i didn't i persevered i pushed through and see the universe rewarded me okay i know we all thought that this top was going to be weird or maybe we didn't but it's like this and like this look how cute it looks with these pants okay i need to stop doing this because i'm making a mess but the last thing i'm styling is this sweater look how cute with this skirt successful shopping day [Music] i can't play drums because of my [ __ ] finger injury and i look like a [ __ ] school teacher right now i need to get my [ __ ] together i know i said i wasn't gonna clean my closet but it's gotten to an unhealthy point here so here's a time lapse of me cleaning out my closet it's the next day today's my friend amanda's birthday happy birthday amanda [Music] my love language recently has become cheese boards so we're making her a cheeseboard it's crazy i made one video or two videos about a cheese board and now you guys share videos of cheese boards with me and i really appreciate it um so i feel like it would be [ __ ] inappropriate not to do this with you i've accumulated a lot of different ingredients recently i've also accumulated these small bowls that are amazing for cheese boards so we're in for a treat today chamberlaincoffee.com so first we're starting out with the cheeses this is a great cheese this is somebody please tell me how to say that it's like a perfect cheesy hockey pop next we have dubliner aged cheddar this is my personal favorite you cannot go wrong with this cheese the first step for me with cheese boards is always to lay out my cheese and then i fill in the gaps right i also got this new cheese platter check this out so yesterday it rained well actually you know that i [ __ ] filmed yesterday but story time so when the cameras were off and i was in my bed watching tick tocks and my power goes out i don't think my brain fully processed the fact that it was raining because i think if it would have i would have been able to connect the dots that like oh maybe my power went out because it's raining and that happens and so i thought i was being robbed and i call my mom in a frenzy and i'm like i'm think i'm being robbed uh because my power just went out she's like honey it's raining and i ran out to my car and i was wearing virtually nothing and i drive in circles around my town for an hour until i felt like the lights could have come back on i go home the lights are back on i was not being robbed is the moral of the story okay i feel like some nuts could be good cashews i think these are stale but nobody's gonna know these are the best things ever cracker assortment because you just can't go wrong like you know you're getting something solid see how amazing that is and they don't give you too many guys serious hack okay these crackers are so [ __ ] good so we're gonna put these next to this maybe put those like here see i'm being selfish though i'm just adding the crackers that i like like what does she like i don't care actually i love you amanda happy birthday but like i don't care this cheese board's actually about me a big hit last time i made a cheese board was honeycomb so i'm going to add that again this is really about presentation do you know what i mean that's like what it's all about it's about making a masterpiece period i have had this rosemary in my fridge for so long and i just keep putting it on things as a garnish and then putting it back in the fridge okay i have this chocolate i feel like that could be good oh that kind of looks good though okay i got some dried cherries oh oh my god i'm so excited okay these really spiced [ __ ] up okay these bread sticks are not gonna work anymore save those for another board we're adding rosemary a lot of people like jam and i have this jam here that i could use it's sour cherry okay where could i add this jam you know what i could do i could put it in here with the honey oh that's kind of cute i think it's done i really honestly don't think i should touch it anymore let me show you how i did it's not my best work i'm not perfect and nobody's perfect and on that note i'm gonna turn the camera off and you might be like oh my god emma i'm gonna miss you i'm gonna miss you too but i'm gonna see you next week and we're gonna hang out and we're gonna kiss well like on the forehead nothing weird but until then i'm going to stare at this cheese board for at least 45 minutes contemplate whether i should redo the whole thing over again which you really can't do but contemplate it for sure anyway i love you guys here's your forehead kiss and if anybody ever tries to say oh emma you're not you're not wifey material you literally could never shut your mouth forehead kiss again i literally have to be careful because i will drop my whole masterpiece that i actually hate i love you bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-01-24T18:24:25Z,267641,6742599,9942,hi [Music] good morning everybody i'm vlogging today round of applause i really love vlogging but i have to spread them out because i do the same thing every [ __ ] day i wake up i eat i drink my coffee i maybe exercise although today i'm not in the mood so i don't think that's gonna be happening today i try to cook something and then i play the drums and then i touch my cats at some point and then i go to bed i'm a simple gal i don't know why i'm so hungry it's like 9 30. i'm never this hungry this early i'm trying to think about what i could make i'm definitely gonna do something with these two eggs i also have some avocado let's see if the avocado is still good i made curry soup the other day again i've made this recipe before and oh my god it's so good and i made my mom try it and she was like because my mom's in town it's not bad anyway i made my mom try it she was like this is fire i was like okay queen i know a really yummy thing you can do with your eggs is put pesto in it i just found out about this recently and it's so good but i also kind of want to make a breakfast burrito because i've done that in a long time my tortillas are moldy my tortillas are moldy hey my tortillas are moldy what do i do pop i'm such an idiot i feel like this one's fine i know i always make a breakfast burrito slash breakfast taco of sorts but like it wouldn't hurt you to see the recipe again it's a delicious recipe recipe okay so basically as i was talking about earlier yeah i made soup i'll show it to you these are a little bit old i think it's fine look at my soup can you believe that i made this it's [ __ ] spilled all over but i made this soup and it's so good i'm just checking to see if anything in my refrigerator isn't rotten right now like that smells fine oh i got a new toaster oven as you can see it's massive i'm super excited about it because it has an air fryer in it it's an air fryer toaster literally technology is crazy these days so i'm super stoked to try it uh we can try it all together today and that could be a fun activity okay squishing my sausage vegetarian sausage in there yum yum another thing if you guys watched my last video or the video before it i was talking about how i only wear that one red fleece well guess what i found another red fleece so now i have two red fleeces that i wear to bed why do my avocados only ever look mediocre i never have like a super sexy avocado ever maybe once every blue moon nobody ever talks about how important it is to have sharp knives that you want to cook it makes all the difference like cooking is easier and way more fun when you have sharp knives listen if you're under the age of 10 don't you didn't hear me say that i burned my sausages which means that i did a good job now we're gonna put my egg in it without mixing it first which is gross give me a second because this is really intense oh my god it's time for me to use my new toaster and i have no idea i'll just heat it up you know what yeah wait ah i don't know how to use this oh my god i don't know how this toaster works it has to preheat cancel i don't get it i'm warming up my tortilla in the pan because that's too much for me that was stressful i'll see you when i played it i know that the cheese isn't melted vegan cheese doesn't melt anyway so what's the point of trying to melt it i want to stop eating breakfast foods in the morning and it's not like that i just want to rebel it's because i don't even like i like breakfast foods but not every day like i don't like i i would rather eat something else for breakfast that's kind of [ __ ] beautiful can somebody tell me who decided that bacon was a breakfast food i'm i'm curious like when like what time stamp was it during the civil war i don't know another interesting point breakfast foods are different around the world so why is it in america that it's eggs and bacon but somewhere else is something different why who made that decision i'm trying to decide whether or not i'm in a bad mood you ever do that it's the morning and you're like okay am i gonna be in a bad mood today like i'm just trying to figure that out right now i decided because i'm filming and we're gonna hang out today i mean you i'm not gonna be in a bad boat i know i'm so nice and thoughtful i'm still deciding whether or not i'm in a bad mood i don't know nothing a little drums can't fix oh would you look at that it's dark out it's the same day and it's 10. you can't see i mean i guess you could just trust me let's talk let's talk because i didn't film for the rest of the day and why is that because i had a mental breakdown yes i did and you guys are probably like emma can you stop having those the thing is think about how much you have them it's more common than we think maybe i had a meltdown i i just wanted to lay in bed like i didn't want to film anything i didn't want to like talk to anybody i didn't want to talk at all i didn't want to exercise i didn't want to read an email like i just didn't want to do anything i felt like that was being a failure i ended up taking the day to rest i had probably two or three mental breakdowns today like where i started crying actually only one was a mental breakdown two were just me crying one night i had a freak out i did i freaked out you know when you freak out and you're like i can't move and i'm good and i can't get up anyway that happened and my dad was like you need to go for a walk or a run or something so i ended up going on a job and that really helped and i cried and people were walking their dogs and they were seeing me cry but it was beautiful and i feel better now and then my dad sent me a drum beat to learn and i learned it in like two seconds you want to see i mean that's kind of fire that feels hella good to do like when i do it i'm like so we're gonna try again vlogging tomorrow right like maybe tomorrow will be better i also try to take an instagram photo myself like i try to take a selfie hated every single one i also have indigestion but i also did cook today i made broccoli in the oven and i burnt it actually and i ate it anyway how dope was that drum beat though anyway i don't think i'm gonna brush my teeth tonight i don't really want to but i'll see you tomorrow and i know that the video is not over so it's like i don't need to give you a forehead kiss but i'm going to sleep so i still want to give you a forehead kiss early do you guys mind i'm just asking to make sure it's okay you know it's a little bit early but i'm i you'll still get one at the end of the video i'm just doing one a little forehead kiss a little early good night sweetheart well you might not be you're not going to bed because you're still watching my video but um i'm going to bed so good night from me but you're still staying up wait i can't become a drumming channel like what why do i keep am i like bragging but i'm not good like i'm not good enough to brag so it's like this weird middle ground of me like showing it and like anybody who actually knows how to play drums is like [ __ ] i [ __ ] up i [ __ ] up literally shut up everybody shut up i'm literally not even brushing my teeth tonight yolo some people have been saying recently oh emma started drumming she changed nobody said that nobody ever said that good night forehead kiss i'm losing it it's the next day check i had a decent morning it's like 11 a.m i woke up early i watched tick tocks i went for a jog it felt terrible jogging it hurt i didn't want to do it i played drums for like an hour i ate breakfast i made coffee like whatever i've done i've done my morning routine i need to shower i don't want to um i tried out a new texturizing spray because now that my hair is short you want to see how short it is i'll show you my hair is short so i have to put in texturizing spray or else it looks like i'm a border collie see okay but the problem is i put this texturizing spray in and it made my hair feel disgusting and it's been in my hair for like three days and it's not good so like i need to wash it but i don't want to also i just sweated all over my body when i went for my jaw but i'm gonna do a face mask i don't know i feel like this is like a self-care day like always the day after a mental breakdown it's like okay let's recharge maybe i'll try to look cute today i feel like i do this in every vlog i'm like okay let's like get ready okay let's go to the store okay let's cook something okay bye everybody see you next week life hack about doing face masks i tend to be lazy when it comes to face masks because i'm like okay like oh [ __ ] it's in my mind i'm lazy about face mask because i don't want to like stand there and wash it off but if you put it on before you plan on showering hello then you wash it off in the shower do you want to hear my do you want to hear me play drums again are we sick of that yet i sound so much better at that new beat today that i want to show you so i will fine i'll show you i can't get this one right i've been working on it for like two weeks and it still sounds like [ __ ] okay so it's like what do i do now because it's like i'm not hungry because i already ate i had leftover broccoli and like four spoonfuls of peanut butter for breakfast like that's that's where i'm at right now what if i baked something no see no what do i want to do give me let's have a pow-wow let's have a meeting let's have a meeting about what the [ __ ] i should do nobody is allowed to talk to me for the next rest of my life that's step one i could cook sure but i don't really want to do that today um i could sit and play drums all day okay sure but my uh shins get tired when i play drums for more than like three minutes i could shower i could make myself look cute okay great but then it's like where do i go there's nowhere to go i know i just got an air fryer and i know i could go use that and that would be fun but it's like i have cauliflower that i could cook in there i also have indigestion i got nothing i don't want to shower but this is good for us okay if you haven't showered yet today or this week let's shower together it will help us during our time of sadness and pain showering always helps you guys know that we know that get out of bed pause the video take a shower come back hilly out of the shower i am not in the mood to do my full skincare routine so i'm just gonna put on some oil and hope that that's enough i would put on sunscreen but i'm really not going outside maybe i should anyway just a little bit of sunscreen never hurt anybody i'm actually getting hungry and i think this is the perfect time to try out my air fryer the virality is that a word my air fryer is actually connected to my toaster so we'll see if that makes it better or worse i don't know oh my god i hate short hair on me i really hate it put on check see now it's like hair is out of the question it's not even a discussion point anymore oh all my chamberlain coffee mason jars are dirty what is a girl to do you want to know what i did last night that really made my day i went through my spotify and i made all of my playlists like i i updated all my playlists and then i just renamed them to things that were like a little bit more interesting for example um my favorite playlist that i have is called my dad's kitchen and it is all of the songs that would echo from my dad's kitchen into my room as a child so that was really so if you're kind of bummed out like me and don't have anything to do and are gonna play with your air fryer all day to like pass time um i recommend updating your spotify playlist whoever closed this almond milk last really didn't do a good job oh wait it was me i hate being roommates with myself like literally i'm the one that leaves all the dishes in the sink that's me but then i'm also the one that finds it and it's like who did that well it's always me let's figure out what we can air fry because i have i'm kind of actually out of groceries but you best believe i'm not gonna go grocery shopping until it's a literal [ __ ] emergency so i have this leftover cauliflower this is screaming to me please air fry me so i will i don't really get how it works do i like add oil to it like how does this work okay that's really not a lot of cauliflower but also it's probably better this way because if it ends up being disgusting then like we didn't waste even when i get like pre-cut [ __ ] i still cut it myself because i don't like how they do it foil put this here and then put out the cauliflowers on it drizzle of olive oil i don't know some salt all-purpose seasoning that i just inhaled into my nose and put it in the airfryer and see what happens okay well that's preheating i think that a new pair of shoes came in the mail for me they did are you [ __ ] this just made my day the fact that i got new shoes today means that i might need to go run errands like this this these new shoes make me want to run errands let's try them on wait these are these are fire that leads us into our sponsor of today's video which is go thank you goat for sponsoring this video wait actually i'm so sorry goat you guys are gonna need to wait because my air fryer is preheated and we need to pop these these bad boys in oh my god this is so exciting okay anyway goat is basically where i get all my shoes it is a global platform for all things past present and future goat has got it all you can get exclusive sneakers just drop sneakers apparel they got all of it on the app from the world's leading brand all resale products are verified they're verified and authenticated by goat so you know you're not

want to twin with me they're the women's don't glow in coast by the way you're welcome also i made a sneaker collection on goat if you want to shop all my favorite sneakers i'm not the biggest sneaker head i don't know everything about sneakers but i know what i like i made a collection on goats so you can check it out and the link is in the description and you can shop it anyway i love you goat i get so many of my clothes and shoes from you guys because i trust you and i love you and you have it all and thank you for sponsoring this video it's done this is hot here's what our little cauliflower friends look like let's plate it up and put a sauce on it i could have let them go longer but that is also user error and not air fryer air so we have our cauliflower i bought this spicy chipotle dressing that's vegan and gluten-free and all that i actually don't like the sauce at all putting it back in the fridge what okay i like this sauce better this is a lemon tahini dressing let's put it down all over there just for you guys i'm gonna put on a piece of rosemary wow and then i'm gonna immediately remove it and put it back in the packaging because i don't actually want to eat the rosemary anyway let's try i can say i understand the hype with the air fryer because it cooks really quick it does a pretty good job cooking the thing all the way through it's easy i'm not mad about it i think i'm gonna take a moment to draw and think about what um i should do with my life nothing makes me feel better than running errands which is funny because it's like that's not very fun but it's like this relief in serotonin i get from running errands so i feel like i need to do that today but the problem is i'm so unmotivated to do it it's so much easier to just lay in my bed but i know that i'll feel good if i go and run errands so i'm gonna set a goal for myself today i actually need to go grocery shopping i just made my last vegetable that i had in the fridge i have nothing left now and i also need to go return a pair of pants that i bought that didn't fit me anyway i'm gonna draw a picture maybe i'll draw a coffee bug the other day i decided to paint a pickle because i was sad and bored and that looks like [ __ ] and shockingly me painting made me feel really good and calm drawing is good even if you suck at it the [ __ ] is that it sucks and there's my mason jar of the day okay i drew something nobody can say that i'm not taking the steps for my mental health i'm gonna do one more drawing and then i'm gonna run my errands is this silver oh fun silver i'm just gonna draw something really fast and see what frankie i'm just gonna draw something really fast wait why is this kind of fire maybe it's like art is better if you're not thinking about it like this is actually kind of cute and good wait like this is not bad at all maybe that's gonna become my new thing like doing super fast just like drawings of things and seeing what happens because this is kind of fire wait what if i like added other colors to this like what if i like added no do you want it's good the way it is i'm not gonna touch it because i will ruin it okay i'm gonna do one more let's do like a i don't know i'm just gonna like let it happen that might have been a one-hit wonder because now i'm like thinking about it too much see like this one sucks in comparison yeah she she's not as cute like i'm not i'm definitely not a fan of her but like her [Applause] i'm obsessed with her this one reminds me of when napoleon dynamite drew his prom date and gave it to her as a prom invitation and she was disgusted maybe i'll try one more time maybe i'll draw a cat okay the cat sucks i'm literally a one-hit wonder with art like this looks like a toddler druid this looks like a [ __ ] angry toddler druid this should be in the museum of modern art it doesn't make sense let's go run our errands oh [ __ ] i put too much in there nobody's talking to me today also why is it 80 degree i'm [ __ ] sweating my balls well i'm [ __ ] sweating my balls off so basically here's the errand and you know what i'm gonna make it fun the errand is that i need to return a few pairs of jeans it's 80 degrees and i'm sweating but i'm not wearing anything under this so we're just gonna have to roll with it at least we got out of the house that's a really good first step everybody i'm about to get sweaty as [ __ ] did i even put on deodorant [ __ ] i'm gonna be stinky stinky stink stink very soon wait is this store closed it's closed the store the store is closed i can't even return my bat that hurted that did hurt me though can we just get the lighting right jesus christ i mean seriously sorry i did not mean to say his name in vain that was rude we're going to whole foods now we're going to go grocery shopping maybe i'll try some fun new snacks or get some fun new ingredients i think i need to go home and do my makeup i need a little ego boost or something looking in this viewfinder is making me really worry about a lot of stuff but that's what it's about though sometimes you sometimes it's good to not be cute can you not stop in the middle of the road you're so stupid [Music] i did it i did it i was coming out of an aisle and somebody was walking this way i was walking this way but i couldn't see because i was in denial we almost t-boned um not in a good way wait i don't think t-boning is that of a sexual i hope that doesn't have a sexual connotation i had a nice cashier she was very nice thank you whole foods for that and that was the end of it i know what you guys want i know what you little sickos want you guys want a grocery haul although this is going to be the most boring grocery haul of all time so i got some cilantro lime dressing this could be fun on vegetables this other dressing in marinade it's green goddess although it's not really green sesame ginger vinaigrette and marinade one nice big head of cauliflower some good old-fashioned broccoli i got way too much of it i got these um italian garlic and fennel plant-based sausages i got some lemons and limes i got avocados how long are they going to keep doing this minced ginger almond almond milk i also got a new nut milk to try which i think i've tried this before it's the brand malt i can't remember if i've tried it so let's try it right now also don't get mad at me for drinking straight out of the container because i live alone oh [ __ ] that's pretty good dijon mustard with chunks in it dijon mustard without chunks in it two cans of like coconut milk for making soup wait [ __ ] i forgot but i forgot to buy curry paste so now i can't make my soup [ __ ] this is really not like substantial i really kind of [ __ ] up like i should have gotten more anyway bye it's a few hours later you may be wondering emma what were you doing well i would watch tick tocks for eight hours not eight but like close to it but anyway i'm cooking so i thought i'd pull out the can first thing i'm making is tempeh it looks gross right now but basically tempeh is like a vegetarian meat substitute kind of and then i'm also warming up some of my soup let's feed the cats i'm on my mommy [ __ ] i like to mash it up with the cans disgusting but uh i did forget my camera was here but i hope you enjoyed watching them eat i think i made too much soup but i was at this like awkward point where it was like okay i don't like this isn't enough soup for two servings so i'm just gonna try to eat it all at once but i don't think it's a the whole bowl is filled to the brim with soup like that's a lot of soup so i'm just thinking about the future of my soup and it's like once you warm it up again can you put it back in the fridge like i don't know how that works anyway the oven is two degrees from being preheated so i'm just gonna put it in now that will go in there for 20 minutes literally where is my phone though because i need my phone to set the timer alexa 20 minutes on the clock but i don't have an alexa so it looks ready look how much [ __ ] soup i made my phone way too much soup for me to eat in one sitting check it looks so good though oh let's see if it's even warm it's perfect eating temperature after i eat this i'm going to bed i'm done but i love you guys and thank you for hanging out with me over the past 24 hours i appreciate all of you so much and i wish you could try my soup because i bet you would think it was good i believe in us and i love you so much and here's your forehead kiss okay bye see you next week [ __ ]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-01-19T17:16:08Z,350285,6620964,27909,um hi guys so i can't show you my head yet because i did something and before i show you i want you to know that if you find me less attractive than before i'm okay with that um but be gentle with me in the comments because i have a fragile view of myself and um an influx of oh you look worse will send me down a spiral [Music] okay i'm just i'm ner oh god i know we don't have to we honestly actually you can be me what the [ __ ] is this oh my god oh no okay i can explain blonde emma is dead i'm just as sad as you are you actually probably don't care because it's not your hair blonde emma is done and here's what happened i got my roots done basically when you go blonde your roots grow out you have to get them filled so that you're blonde all over your head again whatever whatever i got my hair filled probably five or six times and the last time i got it done for some reason you know there was some bleach on the lower parts of my hair too just to kind of even everything out and it just fried my hair off i mean like my hair was a mess like i went in to get my hair cut and colored yesterday and they were like emma your hair is destroyed so basically i couldn't really be blonde anymore i don't want to not be blonde i love being blonde i love looking like draco malfoy from harry potter i love it but my hair was so damaged that i had no choice i also got a haircut and now my hair is so short i don't really know what i'm gonna do with this hair is my alarm going off wait y'all mind if i have a little drum break how was that was that good i probably won't want to see anybody for a while with my new hair because i'm just kind of hating it a little bit so i can just stay inside play drums get really good so today what i'm going to do is i'm going to try to give myself a makeover i wanted to start out 2021 with hair that was not dead so what we're gonna do today is i'm gonna try to figure out how i can make this hairstyle fun but the first step is that i need to go onto the internet and i need to find inspo okay this is way too close for comfort we're on pinterest um let's see where we go okay here's my hairboard my hair doesn't really resemble okay but i do like these braids though i've been seeing a lot of people doing these braids and i [ __ ] with that but i feel like my vibe is more like like this haircut is kind of like a grungy almost like grungy 80s rock star girl this is what i want to think okay you can say whatever the [ __ ] you tell me but i do like these braids even though they're kind of more like bohoe vibe i need to be writing this down if you know you know we're gonna play with the braid trend i mean i'm happy with that i feel like braids are pretty much the only thing i can do because i can't do any updos right now i could like twist it like do one of those twist and clip no [ __ ] it okay the braids is enough but at this point i'm just really just trying not to have a mental breakdown um because the last time i dyed my hair and it was too dark there's a video of me crying on the internet next let's go to makeup this is my makeup board i'm obsessed with pinterest guys like this is seriously inspiring to me okay i am kind of randomly obsessed with this although i know but that i have eyebrows but i just have never been wanted to do like a dark liner but i think that might be too much because my hair is dark now so it's like that would have worked when i was blonde which hurts that hurts what looks good on brunettes let's like look through okay yes i do pin photos of myself okay this girl's kind of brunette but see she's like she's like the color i wanted to be oh when in doubt what is bella hadid doing do you know what i mean she has brunette hair wait her hair is like my color oh my god it might be oh i need wait maybe i do oh doing like a dark underliner with like a bronzy on top is my alarm going off again i swear to god and i look like a [ __ ] i hate it drum break okay for makeup inspector i'm just going to say bella hoodie um okay so that's a good see there she is again see she's all over my makeup board see she's a perfect makeup in spoke for my new brunette moving on to outfit outfit i feel like there's just who knows like who knows what i'm gonna want to do chamberlaincoffee.com i think i'm sad cause my hair is so short i think if it wasn't this short i wouldn't be as mad but it's oh my god my face okay is basically i have this board it's called retro but where is it i want to do like a cool like 80s okay wait let's look up 80s girl rock star girl okay wait hi okay that's kind of an interesting energy okay wait maybe we what about 70s rockstar girl listen we're gonna be here all day so just be careful oh i think i like 70s better even like that's kind of sick although everybody's blonde oh my god is this see i always wondered like is this gonna affect my love life do you know what i mean okay so like pov you're dating me as blonde emma and then it goes like this are you like sorry no you'll be you're dating me at blonde you love it so much then this you're like oh goodbye we broke up is that what would happen okay i think for fashion i just go in my closet and see what makes the most sense i whatever let's get started with the hair if i don't look super hot by the end of this i'm going to cut off everybody i know it is kind of cute though it's not awful it's not okay it's kind of bad we're doing little mini braids if it ends up looking bad here's what i do number one i just cut off everybody i know i make all of them feel bad i could just be like oh i could basically go to every single person individually and be like this is why you [ __ ] up and this is why i don't want you in my life anymore i make them feel super bad they feel like it's their fault it's not it's mine i dyed my hair color i didn't like once my hair fades and looks cute again maybe it grows out a little bit god only knows but more all the stories i look better i go back to them and say oh my god i'm so sorry for cutting you off and like telling you that you did all this [ __ ] wrong actually i i called the wrong person can we be friends again they're gonna be like oh my god of course that was totally an accident um and then i get my friends back and they're like oh my god your hair's brown it looks so good and i'm like yeah little do they know that i need to cut them off for multiple months okay i kind of hate how that looks because of this stupid hair tie like what the [ __ ] the point of that i hate it here things are off to a bad start maybe if i use a black one would that be better okay the black hair ties better the braid is the braids are stupid they are and i know that do i just leave my hair down like i don't know it's like now we tried we tried something we tried something and it didn't work i feel like it's just one disappointment after another with this new hairstyle i swear to god what if i just spray a little bit of hairspray in it you know what i'm actually happy with that now it looks like a little bit messy a little bit ratty hair is done sorry about the whole braid thing you guys could totally take that idea it just didn't work out for me now i need to pick out my outfit actually wait i need to do it i'm going to wash my face actually i don't want to wash my face right now it's fine that's totally not that's not sufficient i'm just like in a bad mood now so like putting effort in like [ __ ] that who is this who is this i just clogged my toilet where do we go from here you know what i mean i'm also freezing oh you know what i've been seeing way okay so i've been seeing a lot of people wearing tights and i feel like i want to be girlier like i feel like this hair makes me feel not very girly which is fine but like i like i've been recently enjoying the feeling of girly maybe we do some tights oh what about this dress okay dress check okay i have this like black skirt i swear to god i wear this in like every video that i do fashion stuff but it's a go-to it's also [ __ ] freezing in here my phone alarm is going off again this cute little graphic tee could be fun does that look good with my hair color not really it's crazy how you cut your hair and then you're like i don't even want to put on clothes does that happen to anybody should we take a drum break i honestly feel like i might need a drum break no see that's all i have to do i just touch that for like five seconds then i feel better so should we do like a tights look or like a leather pant look i think tights could be fun because they don't normally do tights although i did just get these colored tights that are orange but i feel like i'm already too vulnerable like i'm already too vulnerable right now oh my god these are green wait that's kind of fire actually with a black skirt just because like whatever it's like neutral and then a top of sorts and the top is tbd let's actually get the skirt on and then see what matches um the green tights are making me feel very vulnerable i feel like i could make it work but i'm also like it's a little bit ugly i also feel like it can it could be kind of cool if i use the right top it's like i'm just not wearing the right top right now and i don't have any makeup on so i actually really want to make these green tights work okay check honestly i feel like this top kind of matches the vibe and the red and the green are complimentary and then maybe like a leather jacket on top let's try it on you guys are gonna judge me and that's okay because i'm judging myself what the [ __ ] is this it makes sense in my head every time and then it's like execution is like a no i'm so done what about this top hold on no this doesn't match because the greens are different i'm so sick of this oh we'll be here all day call me crazy but i kind of [ __ ] with this the outfit would be unbelievably great without the green tights but i'm just determined to have them on my body i also like the fact that it's like kind of ugly like i like that like i like the fact that the green tights are like just kind of like this sore thumb in the outfit the contrasting green do you know what we're leaving it's makeup time [ __ ] my hair is pinned back i look like [ __ ] i hate it i'm gonna do my normal makeup routine and then we're just gonna have fun with the eyes and the lips i started applying my foundation with my hands um and i think it's really working out for me it looks so natural and smooth people really do think that i got my lips done and i'm like guys lip plumper try it i feel like my under eye bags kind of match my new aesthetic so i'm just gonna be very light with the concealer also can we talk about the fact that people are drawing on under eye bags on tick tock y'all you didn't invite me to this party oh wait my genetics invited me to the party like i used to be so insecure about my freckles and i did not like them and then people started drawing on freckles i have really bad forehead lines huh maybe that'll be the next trend should i make my eyebrows a little bit darker oh my god wait that actually genuinely looks better what do we think oh i just thought of a shirt that i have that would look so good with this but i honestly well we can explore that later if i remember i'm not going to remember and you guys can't remind me because you're not here we're going for i don't know okay this can't be too hard there's no way this is going to be that hard so it kind of goes up at the end holy [ __ ] oh it does not look that good okay what happened and what went so wrong honestly it could look good it could look good by then um i forgot to do my bronzer so we're gonna do that now i look like a different [ __ ] person right now it's just kind of coppery bruh i mean so we're gonna put this like coppery color all over my lid that's kind of fire actually okay now what a little color in the crease guys it's totally spooky how good at makeup i'm getting okay wait low-key wait i kind of [ __ ] with this new look a little bit it's like it's kind of dark and grungy i like the eye look i'm set on it i'm not going to touch it again until i do mascara that's going to be like the second the mascara's on that's what i'm going to know if my hair is ugly or not before i do mascara let's let's talk jewelry oh what about these black earrings wait look at these wait that could be kind of dope oh i hate it whatever we're learning i think like bigger hoops and the hoop is good i don't want a bigger hoop call me crazy oh oh i know these are very trendy these earrings just say the f word on them which is super funny right because it's like the f word so it's like a bad word it's super funny okay let's figure out a lip color oh this is kind of pretty nope i don't like it i'm gonna go take this off orange is the move no oh no like that mouth okay wait this could be kind of fire oh [ __ ] wait what is this lip balm i [ __ ] with this is why you need to moisturize before you do your makeup because my face looks so crusty right now and i was just too lazy to do it now i'm regretting it don't be like me kids seriously this is literally the moment of truth is the mascara we know this this mascara is also the best mascara ever okay you know what i don't look that ugly like i and if i'm saying that i like being blonde better but this is kind of good let's let the hair down oh god wait it's kind of it's kind of not bad okay wait it's kind of bad should we see it in the real light oh my god oh god okay final reveal honestly hold on do you know what i'll do a final reveal oh my god my camera's crooked so what we're working with for the oh it's kind of good wait it's kind of good let's just act like the green tights never happen because i'm looking in the mirror now and i'm like what the [ __ ] is that the hair allows for darker makeup and i love that like that's so fun i'm gonna start getting into darker makeup as for clothes i don't know i don't think much is gonna change listen we all miss blonde emma she's dead though she literally is so passed away oh i've been screen recording oh my god oh it's an hour and a half [ __ ] oh wait i never put on rings i'm gonna do the outro while i'm picking out rings for my new look sometimes in life you're gonna be handed a haircut you don't like and the thing about a haircut that you don't like is that it doesn't really hurt anybody it's not something that's gonna kill you it's definitely not the end of the world um let's pick out some rings though hold on wait my fingers are so swollen oh what happened there's one why are my fingers so swollen guys i literally can't fit anything on my fingers i always just move my hands and see what they look like with the rings on it anyway um thank you guys for coming on this journey with me i had a little makeover it may seem vain of me to make a whole video around the fact that i changed my hair color these things are very emotional for me for some reason as you guys know from the one time i cried when i dyed my hair which is honestly kind of similar to what my hair looks like right now so i'm surprised i'm not crying but whatever but long story short it's fine i'm not a narcissist i might be actually i know i'm not because i i hate myself let me know if you have any recommendations about how i should style my hair like any makeup looks you think i should do like just message that [ __ ] over to me comment down below do whatever oh my god i have ringworm look at my ring worm it literally looks like a [ __ ] it looks like i put a mug down on a coffee table and it left a stain that's what my ringworm looks like thanks for watching and hang out with me i love you guys forget about the green tights it didn't happen hey everybody emma from the future here i am here to report that i like my haircut now i know it grew on me no pun intended sorry for obsessing over it sorry for being so self-deprecating sorry for the negativity from this i've learned a few things number one if you get a haircut and you hate it you'll probably end up liking it in a week i learned that and i also learned that there's more to life than a haircut and also uh stop the negativity let's just emma let's just try to do better and i also learned that i need to stop calling myself ugly see we learned from this getting this haircut was kind of humbling because it was so scary and such a big change but uh in the grand scheme of things nobody cares anyway here's another forehead kiss i love you guys so much and i'll see you next week and [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2021-01-10T18:09:23Z,267390,5285601,9082,i literally couldn't tell you what's gotten into me but i cook now [Music] i never in my life have enjoyed cooking ever and something clicked recently over the holidays i had a lot of time to reflect on myself and i spent a lot of time in silence and a lot of time in my mind i got this inspiration to start cooking in the new year and i don't know where it came from part of it could be that i only watch cooking videos now on youtube that's all i watch so that could be part of it i also only watch cooking tick tocks the internet is not so terrible and negative of a place if you're watching cooking videos virtually anything else quite negative i've watched so many cooking videos that i actually know a decent amount about cooking i know i haven't really cooked very much i think the most i've done is roast vegetables but that's still a huge milestone for me but there's something i've been wanting to make since i started my new cooking journey about a week ago i'll show you a photo they're called buddha bowls and they're like these healthy like vegetable bowls where there's like a bunch of different ingredients vegetables and like avocado and all those different types of things to be honest with you i've always wanted to make one the reason why i haven't yet is because you have to cook like 10 different things in the oven but i don't care so we're gonna do that today cooking with emma wifey edition i'm growing up i need to learn how to cook or else i'm literally my kids are going to be eating yogurt and like that's it like literal like yogurt cups like my kids are going to eat yogurt cups if i don't [ __ ] figure my [ __ ] out i'm gonna try i literally have my [ __ ] laptop here with the recipe i wrote out the recipe and everything like i'm changing something happened to me i literally have okay i can't even show you my computer because i have so much so many of my i write my emotions sometimes in my notes so i probably shouldn't put that on the screen i'm making kale chickpeas tofu and cauliflower and broccoli mixed up together okay so what do we start with what do we start with first we set the oven to 400 degrees watch me get an air fryer next everybody is obsessed with air fryers now like that's all anyone cares about anymore okay first thing i need to start working on is my tofu i'm a vegetarian as we know and so i can't eat meat but i actually like tofu although it gives me terrible gas like when i tell you this [ __ ] gives me the worst gas like i can't even like i literally cannot be social after eating tofu it's awful so i have some extra firm tofu here and i'm going to drain all the water the gross and disgusting water and i'll be back don't worry about me guys i'm just draining my tofu trying not to break it while i'm at it that took me way longer than it needed to watch so for some reason yeah that looks disturbing tofu has a lot of um liquid in it so what i read online is that you're supposed to press it whatever that means anyway so while i'm cutting up my tofu let me talk about something as you can see i'm wearing this red fleece i talked about this on my instagram story if you don't follow me on instagram you didn't see it which is completely fine and i don't blame you i post a lot on instagram probably too much probably an annoying amount i post a lot of photos myself never of anything else and i find that to be a little bit narcissistic so if you don't follow me there i don't blame you but i wear this fleece literally every night to bed what's so special about that fleece let me explain to you how picky i am about clothes if anything is remotely itchy i'm talking about remotely itchy i can't wear it when i was younger if i would wear socks and they had like you know when you wear socks and there's like a seam above the toe okay great so now a bunch of foot fetish you know what it's fine have it in a sock there's a seam that goes across the toe i used to buy special socks that had no seams because the seam on the toe would bother me do you see what i'm saying very picky about my clothing okay this is how i press the tofu by the way i take another plate and i put it on top and i don't even know if it works i'm so picky about clothes and especially when i'm sleeping and this has not one bit of itchiness there's nothing itchy about it there's nothing it's perfect next we're gonna do our veggies okay is this a tutorial i mean it can become a tutorial it can so you guys just need to let me know the thing about me is that i have really bad digestion right and if i don't eat a lot of fruits and vegetables i'm just not gonna poop so here's what i'm doing i'm laying out my broccoli and my cauliflower now notice i brought it pre-cut because i'm a lazy piece of [ __ ] it needs a little bit more cutting okay because like pieces like this who could fit so we're going to cut these into smaller pieces people eat like healthy buddha bowls like this probably are like literally so happy they don't even like they probably have never felt pain before and i want that so we're gonna do olive oil a lot of it a lemon fun fact i found that store-bought lemons taste way better than lemon juice from a bottle normally my lazy ass is like lemon juice from the bottle sign me the [ __ ] up not anymore [ __ ] i'm different now i have a lot of cuts on my finger right now and there is now lemon juice in it you can't tell i mean excruciating pain but i have a very high pain tolerance oh but i love bragging about how high my pain tolerance is like i broke my hand once i didn't cry which is crazy because i probably should have excuse me where's my pink himalayan salt what the [ __ ] oh oh no wait where is it ow found it okay i broke my hand and i didn't cry and i literally just constantly brag about that to everybody i meet like it's really not that bad of a thing to have a low pain tolerance and to cry when you get hurt like that's pretty normal standard human behavior but anyway this is salt i put salt on it i'm also going to put garlic powder on it because it's so much easier than chopping actual garlic that's a lot of garlic powder but i want everybody to stay far away from me including vampires and all of that i do have this everyday seasoning from trader joe's and it's just sea salt mustard seed black peppercorn coriander onion garlic paprika chili pepper and i like it i do i like it a lot so i'm gonna add that like that's probably good i'm just gonna mix it on up i would normally use my hand but i have that cut on my finger and i know i have a high pain tolerance so yeah like doesn't even hurt me that bad like i'm literally totally fine and i literally can't even feel it when the lemon goes in my cut but i'm just doing this because like i don't want to have to wash my hands that's totally what it is cooking is all about instinct it's like okay this looks kind of dry we're going to add a little bit more olive oil you know what i'm saying like just follow your instincts here i also feel like it needs more seasoning like this looks really boring but then again i'm gonna add a sauce on top of that what do i do is it weird to like try one of the pieces raw it actually has a lot of flavor this is done next next chickpea check take a can of garbanzo beans next take your favorite strainer next guys can you believe though like how far i've come if you guys have been watching my videos for a long time oh [ __ ] you ew you guys have been watching my videos for a long time if you guys have been watching cooking with emma for a long time you would know that i'm a i'm a honestly i'm a terrible cook like truly i'm just not good and the reason why i'm not good is because i can't follow a recipe properly i always have to skim through it and i always miss an important step my mom has always said to me growing up she was like emmy you need to slow down she's right anyway time for me to rinse off my beans i find it so funny that so many people think that beans are gross i don't understand why anybody would dislike beans they're so good and they don't even make me fart like literally everything else makes me fart cameron coffee.com i actually used to make these as a kid my mom and i would make roasted chickpeas there's a lot of water and that's not supposed to happen so we're just gonna pat dry our chickpeas here can you believe i like memorize these recipes too like i read the recipe once i haven't even gone back to the paper olive oil coat it coat it up coat it up we're gonna try to fit the tofu it's not going to work huh okay sorry salt paprika is that it and garlic powder okay so it's the new year now we're in 2021 uh when i'm filming this it's not 2021 yet one of my goals this year is to be ahead with my life instead of always being down to the minute so i'm trying to like you know film videos ahead of time and things like that that's one of my new year's resolutions that i came up with actually just now um we're moving this to the side see it's oh wait can you believe i like memorize these recipes too like okay i read the recipe once i haven't even gotten back to the paper oh wow okay here's what we're doing next this is when things get complicated so we have our pressed tofu here right which is great but i've not really figured out a good way to like season it yet okay this is disgusting what i'm doing i think i'm gonna basically do this like i'm cooking meat put olive oil on it then dip it in seasoning and then put it back on the you'll see first we're using nutritional yeast it's like almost like cheesy in a way but it's like not cheesy but it like kind of gives off cheesy vibes okay we're gonna add garlic powder garlic powder is really going in everything then we're gonna add this everyday seasoning i feel like this solid spice blend right you take the tofu rub olive oil watch i'm gonna rub olive oil all over it rub it all mmm then you're gonna pack it in the seasoning right pack the seasoning all around it and then you have a little crusted tofu piece that's so cute while i'm doing this we can talk about some things i've been thinking about number one i'm so sick of tick-tock i say this every video though but i am done with it like i'm not lying i think that for once i'm actually gonna have a good result actually maybe not it could be bad still but and it's also easy because everything cooks for 30 minutes you just leave everything in the oven for 30 minutes you're done oh my god ew i did wash my hands before i started but it's there's still something gross about what i'm doing and i understand that no i didn't show you washing my hands why because i'm probably lying we do have an issue i'm out of seasoning [Music] i don't want to cook anymore and we're back see i don't even remember what i put in it the first time that's probably i think that's right i feel like baking is easier than cooking and call me crazy but i feel like well that's not necessarily true because if you're making like a croissant that [ __ ] is complicated y'all look up right now how to make a croissant it's gonna ruin your day it will literally it ruined mine because now i'm confused about how the world is able to make so many croissants every day if it literally is that complicated after this video don't do it yet but after this video yep this is my last piece guys we [ __ ] did it actually i'm not done cooking but i'm gonna sprinkle some of this seasoning over the top i don't know if that's necessary but i'm doing it anyway everything is going in the oven for 30 minutes let's just pop that hoe in what should i put on top nobody teaches you this stuff i wish i had an alexa right now because i'd be like alexa set my timer for 15 minutes i'm also kind of scared of having an alexa like i feel like she would listen to me and i feel like we'd become too close i want to add some fresh kale is that such a [ __ ] crime there's a special way that you need to do kale and i'll show you bowl kale kale is difficult i love the flavor of it but dealing with it is not easy like i don't know like this bag is so packed full with kale that it's just gonna explode when i open it didn't explode but okay so you're gonna add some kale that's like probably too much to be honest i'm gonna go through and i'm gonna pick out the stalks because i really hate the hard stalks in kale kale is a very sensitive food for me like it cannot be messed up oh my god there's so many stumps in here i'm gonna [ __ ] freak out i just need to cut my own kale and stop being a lazy [ __ ] i'm gonna add some olive oil and i'm gonna add some salt and i'm gonna massage my kale now i didn't know that people were supposed to massage kale until like i didn't know that that helped the kale's texture until recently but i read an article about it it was like if you're not massaging your kale you aren't doing it right now i'm gonna place it aside on this dirty plate and then i'm gonna use this bowl again later for plating see less dishes more efficiency i'll see you guys in 30 minutes when everything's done baking thank you taking a quick break to thank our sponsor of today's video honey can you shut up have you been doing a lot of online shopping so have i that's where honey comes in honey is a

minutes and i decided that i should do something responsible and i should like kind of sh like mix things up a little bit oh [ __ ] don't do what i just did wow emma you can really cook i want to try chickpea [Music] this is just what i needed getting a little stressed out in the kitchen chamberlaincoffee.com oh i can't sing on youtube 15 more minutes in the oven and then whatever's next god only knows oh my god oh my god oh my god it's time okay our vegetables oh [ __ ] how our proteins guys i mean seriously i literally can't with how good it looks [Applause] i'm so proud of myself my kids are gonna eat so good one day this is very adult food do you know what i mean like this is not something kids would like but you know what i don't even care i'm going to assemble it right now okay wait watch it doesn't really look as good as i would i want it to look like but i don't even care at this point because actually it looks pretty good so here's my rule if you cooked everything you're allowed to use a pre-made sauce so i'm using a lemon tahini dressing guys it looks pretty impressive do i have permission to eat it first we're going to try the chickpeas need a little bit more salt next we're trying the tofu hot the tofu is crazy next we're trying the broccoli or another cauliflower first very tender and good broccoli very tender and good last but not least the kale which i already know what it tastes like but i'll eat it again very good guys are you freaking serious i'm so proud of myself right now this is unbelievable believe in yourself look at me i just cooked something and am now eating the whole thing that never happened this is a really good sign that things might be looking up for me in the cooking department i think hook [ __ ] anybody who ever said i couldn't cook thank you guys for watching now that i'm a cooking youtuber comment down below what you want me to cook next for you guys i can't promise that i'll come up with a recipe but i can promise that i'll find a good one online for all of us to recreate and i'll make little tweaks to it so that it's easier because i don't like doing anything that's complicated i love you guys so much thank you so much for watching i hope that you guys are proud of me for my new cooking skills and abilities this is the best cooking with emma i've ever made i hope that you guys give cooking a try this year in 2021 i'm going to give you your forehead kiss wait [ __ ] oh my god when she burps in your face and then gives you a kiss that's hot bye [Music] you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-12-27T21:31:22Z,375041,9318500,11674,[Music] that was kind of fire [Music] hi hey you you why does my hair look ew i don't even know why i'm bringing this up but i just bought these new shoes and i literally am obsessed with these anyway let's go downstairs god i look ugly as [ __ ] i started the vlog i'm vlogging today i missed the vlogmas memo this year and i'm sorry about that like it hurt me to see everybody doing vlogmas and for me to just be like lacking in that department but vlogmas is just not my thing i've given up trying to talk over the coffee grinder so i feel like that shows maturity and growth in me i got a drum set and the amount of serotonin that playing the drums releases for me is disgusting my mental health has improved tremendously since getting this drum set how sad can i really be if like getting a drum set fixes my problems but then again it's not fair to invalidate my own feelings so look at this sweet little baby angel so i'm blogging today i'm really excited because i don't know i don't really know why today i want to make hummus i'm kind of nervous about it because i just feel like i have hummus in the fridge that like i really like and am i just going to waste like an hour making hummus for me to hate it i don't know um another thing my friend olivia is going on a date so i'm gonna help her get ready for her date and we're gonna help we're gonna help her get ready for her date i need to go to the mailbox but unfortunately we will be pushing that off until tomorrow because i really don't want to do it um and i'd rather play my new drum set than my dad just built for me and ignore all other responsibilities i don't want to exercise at all like it's the last thing i want to do to be completely honest but i know that i need to do it because i know that i'll feel good if i do it um so that's how i'm going to start out my day today i think i'm going to go for a little jog around town oh my god it sounds terrible um my period's coming and so i popped out a little zit today whenever i'm pmsing i don't want to go for a [ __ ] run this is what i'm gonna start doing every time i'm in like mental pain where i'm like god like i don't know what to do about this or that guess what i'm gonna start doing this my neighbors are going to hate me [Music] this is really the last thing i want to do most of my

can i not talk as well as your creative director i truly am in love with the brand back to the video this is killing my vibe i feel like i just like look whack like do you know what i mean like do you ever just feel like you wake up and look like [ __ ] like that's how i felt today i kind of want to make myself look really cute like what if i did pigtails or something like i want to put on a cute outfit and i want somebody to see me at the store and be like oh my god she's so cute nobody would say that to me right now unless they fix what's going on these hairs have been getting in the way of my happiness a lot recently every time i do this hairstyle i feel like really confident like i feel like this hairstyle really like brings me out of my shell and makes me feel like a cartoon character in like a good way it looks minorly stupid but i i think i think it'll do i mean whatever like i'm wearing a mask all day like nobody's gonna see me i'm just in the mood for a serve we're making hummus today so i need to go to target and i need to go to target that's pretty much it do i look like a seven-year-old though i did just hair spray it and for what i don't know is that even going to do anything oh my god it looks so bad in the back no wait that's not okay it's not great but it's also not that bad okay let's do makeup and see if we can turn this around it's supposed to be like hot girl winter and i'm supposed to be like i don't know like just feeling confident and [ __ ] but you know let's start the makeup i have phases where sometimes i'm like i feel better and more confident without makeup and then sometimes i have phases where i'm like i like wearing makeup and that's when i feel best i can't tell where i'm at right now i think i'm like in the mood for makeup i haven't cleaned my makeup brushes in literally three years and i am concerned about the effects that that could be having on my skin we have to cover this zit today it's gonna be our challenge of the day i look like an alien i always just go through different lip plumpers this one i think makes me look like i'm having an allergic reaction which honestly is kind of a fun challenge i got invisalign [ __ ] i did not mean to put that right there um i got invisalign a few months ago and i never wear it so my teeth are crooked again i'm not very smart and i don't think i thought about the fact that like you know you have to wear it every day and if you like you wait one day then it's gonna like [ __ ] up the whole thing and so i just kind of [ __ ] up the whole thing time to powder the face up this is not a powder brush but we're using it as one my daily makeup routine has not changed in so long that i will see you after update i'm doing something weird i'm taking purple i don't know what i'm doing kind of looks pretty though kind of also looks awful purple eyeshadows on should i try to do like eyeliner emma don't do that i know i only have one color of blush that i know of i literally have this and that's it and i don't think that well it can match it matches if i don't have at least one person come up to me at the grocery store and be like wow queen i'm gonna be pretty pissed i need to add like an eyeliner dark purple and brown this could go many ways i don't know oh my god what have i done listen i've done better and worse things i think we just act like it's good like i'm almost nervous to go in public like it ah oh i'm do you know what we're done we're done with the eyes highlighter i've literally been using the same highlighter for years what do i need now should i draw like a little star or something to cover my pimple i see people do that on tick tock i'm not going to do it because i think it would just make things worse cute idea though sorry focus is needed oh my god i don't know i don't know do i even like this color stop calling me i'm having a mental breakdown what went wrong i'm just gonna distract myself by going to the store and making hummus that's the only thing i can think of doing fit check do i even like it like i don't even know if i like it i don't know there's something about the pants but you know what i have a cooking project today that's number one priority i also have to get olivia ready for her date later like these are the priorities not my outfit i mean it's kind of cool these pants just suck no this is cool this is why i have issues one minute i'm like let's just get in the car all right [ __ ] the glasses so i did a little bit of hummus research and it turns out that i don't need a food processor i can use my blender and because of that i will be not going to target which is honestly kind of a relief it's really hard for me not to want to make a cheese board for no reason but i'm i really have nobody to see i think i want to go to trader joe's i don't shop at trader joe's frequently but it's fun because every time i go i know that they're gonna have a new array of fun little things to try i've also been seeing this thing on tick tock talking about how the cashiers that work at trader joe's are like trained to flirt with you is this true although i've never been flirted with by a trader joe's employee so that kind of hurts my feelings maybe it's because i look 11. that very well could be it [Music] i'm back and i bought snacks so i got everything i needed to make my hummus but i also bought two different fun flavors of nuts cocoa chili and caramel coffee cashews the caramel coffee cashews are coming up first they did a good job oh my god yeah they're sweet but not too sweet the coffee flavor is so good i'm like obsessed those are really good you know what i mentioned earlier that um like trader joe's employees are supposed to flirt with you my trader joe's employee today was actually the complete opposite i feel like he actually hated me stop y'all i just found the best nuts at trader joe's like wow guys those were so delicious like genuinely so delicious and then we go home and i make my make my hummus and it's just like life is good let's do this step one blender we're supposed to use the juice the bean juice where am i measuring cups do i even have measuring cups this could be going south really quick i might not even have measuring cups oh my god wait i could use a mason jar hold on okay okay i'm just gonna wing it i actually don't even know oh wait is this the wrong oh my god is my [ __ ] can opener broken no i'm just broken oh god you i don't know how to feel about this is this a 30 ounce can oh no it's not okay so i have to half the recipe okay never mind we solved the problem i honestly probably had all the ingredients for this and didn't need to go to the store but i just wanted to have a little serve okay now we're going to add the bean juice which is again very gross to me but i'm just trying to go with the flow here half cup of tahini it's why does it smell like peanut butter should i try a little bit of it by itself i wouldn't recommend eating that by itself it says a half cup patini i i feel like i could eyeball it maybe a little bit more um a fourth cup of olive oil i think this is gonna make a lot more than i can eat so two lemons honestly this is kind of therapeutic i've been watching a lot of cooking shows recently because it just is like the only thing that makes me feel relaxed i've learned a few tips and tricks along the way one is to roll your lemons because it makes them it makes it like more juicy okay do i have a lemon squeezer of course i don't would have been way too good to be true if i did you know what i do have though is this wait what strainer see look how handy that is oh [ __ ] ow almost ready to blend it i need to take my makeup off i'm like i'm retiring for the day it's 2 45 i'm like this is it i need to do two garlic cloves but my question is is this a clove of garlic or is it the little cloves inside oh my god my hands are gonna smell like garlic okay cloven it smells good actually okay two cloves of garlic hopefully a clove is this a whole clove sorry i don't know why that was a genuine scream too like i was genuinely frightened about that too much oh my god i'm so excited kidding me oh my god it's hummus i'm trying it i'm trying it and it's not as good as i expected what could i add to make it better let's improvise it needs more lemon juice for sure that's a lot actually i probably should have done that i also feel like it needs a lot more salt that might be too much that's a lot i feel like this is like the easiest thing that you could possibly make and the fact that i just may have messed it up is unbelievable to me there's something wrong with it it's like it needs acid maybe if i serve it up how did i [ __ ] it up like it has no ingredients i don't see how i could have messed it up take a little bit of olive oil and do a little boo i mean it looks nice paprika oh my god that was way today is a bad day there's like for sure something wrong with it but like i can't stop eating let me know what i did wrong if you know down below because it's not like the worst thing i've ever eaten but also why do i hate it how does this not taste normal did i get the wrong type of tahini i'm still gonna eat it because i worked hard on it but there's something wrong with it the makeup look only lasted what two hours but i'm okay with that it got its moment it got its time and now it's time to take it off [Music] no i'm getting my friend olivia ready for her date later don't worry they both got coveted tested and they're only seeing each other i know those are the things we have to think about now i'm really excited i'm excited because i feel like all my friends go on dates like first dates i've never been on a first date i've never been like hey let's go to dinner i've only i've gone on dates in relationships but i've never like gone on a first date so i always think it's fun to like help my friends out when they're gonna go on a date and i kind of get to like experience it through them but honestly first dates sound like my worst nightmare i really i'm actually kind of glad that every time i've ever met a guy it's never been on like in a date format because that just sounds awful i'm kind of grateful that i've never experienced that but either way i'm probably gonna take a nap until then so bye um a few updates okay so number one why am i chewing gum you may ask oh my god this zit is really killing my butt the shitty hummus that i made gave me extremely awful garlic breath i've brushed my teeth three times drank lemon juice because i read online that that's a cure for it and now i'm chewing gum number two i did arrive at olivia's house and she is in the shower i believe and can't let me in oh my god is that olivia oh my god you did not just come out here come inside why don't you don't oh my god i feel like this that was like almost like it was planned like david dobrik that was amazing it was not planned i'm here to say that okay great see ya i'm naked let's go a lot's going on number one tell me what you're doing uh i'm putting the ocean on because my legs are dry okay and it smells like cat [ __ ] and i hope it doesn't stay on me i can guarantee you that i've never had a man complain about cat [ __ ] smell on me and that should have happened by now so like i feel like you're good also she got out the nail polish check

-emma chamberlain",2020-12-19T21:26:10Z,209279,3353113,6492,thank you to google for sponsoring a portion of today's video hi i'm doing a collab today i know that's crazy and super abnormal i'm bringing in a very special guest she did have food poisoning earlier today so if she's seeming a little bit off it's not because i'm forcing her to film with me it's because she had food poisoning but it's also possible that i did force her to film with me after having food poisoning which might even be worse than both and i'm welcoming to you my mother come on in [Applause] are you nervous no no you're not i just ate a burrito so i'm going to be breathing in your face i'm sorry i don't care okay okay [Music] okay so here's what we're doing today so you and my dad know me both pretty well like both of you and everybody it's like probably about even but i feel like she's more honest and i feel like she well you know we're women so we just a little bit more and so i wanted to bring my mom in and i wanted to ask her questions about me and basically expose me on the internet i'm gonna do my best i feel so bad she literally was like having diarrhea like an hour ago honestly so she got a she got food poisoning from a burrito that i decided to have for lunch today before we get into it we're going to talk about our sponsor which is google thank you google for sponsoring this portion of today's video i'm a big fan of y'all and have been forever actually google's been really helping me with my holiday shopping this year because it's a nightmare every single year but google's making it really easy because they have a bunch of cool stuff that you can get for literally anybody in your life and they're going to love it everything's a helpful price there's something for everybody and all of google's products work together seamlessly so it's like it's just a win-win for example google has these pixel buds can't go wrong okay so we have the google pixel 5. this has an amazing camera the camera can do ultra wide shots this also has built-in personal safety features car crash detection and safety check and it starts at 699 pixel 5 is a win something that i'm not sure if i'm going to give away or keep for myself because i kind of really want it but i also need to give things as gifts is the nest audio it creates a big sound but not for a big price it is 75 louder and has a 50 stronger base than the original google home and i love listening to music at really badly high volumes it's only 99.99 if you want to buy it for somebody but i think i'm gonna keep it for me because i love loud music the next thing is chromecast with google tv this is literally the best thing ever because it lets you watch whatever you want all in one place it's everything that you want to watch on your tv all in one place it's really easy to find what you want to watch across your apps so that you can spend more time actually watching the movie rather than browsing around and being annoyed i think i'm gonna give this to my dad because i feel like he doesn't know how to use a tv okay this is something i'm also keeping for myself nest wi-fi it's the best-selling mesh system in the us it's super fast it's reliable wi-fi that you can trust and i'm probably going to be keeping this for me because i need better wi-fi so and this starts at 149 anyway big thank you again to google for sponsoring this portion of today's video i really appreciate it and i'm very excited to be gifting these products and also keeping some for myself back to the video with my mom i hate when i do things like you know i could definitely go without doing that stuff uh first question rate me as a daughter on a scale from one to ten then you can be completely honest um i feel like you're a 10 just because you're such a good no you that's too nice i feel like you're a 10 because you're you know you're caring and you're okay you guys hear that if i were to like like compare you to like other kids your age i am so glad that you're mine and not that fair enough okay i appreciate that answer not to be mean or anything no when am i most frustrating when you're fighting your head so like when i'm like in a if i'm like bad up here then i'm bad everywhere yeah because it's really hard to break through that and and get you to see a different perspective because you're so i'm stubborn yeah you're very stubborn and you're so fixated that it's like no matter what i say it doesn't you know okay that's also fair like what's something that i do you won't feel good something won't feel good okay so like something won't feel good so i'll say you know like well try this or try that and i'm like no i don't want to do any of it that's true you'll be like it's time to problem solve and i'm like i like feeling the pain and not fixing it personally right right and that's just so frustrating yeah i get that next one one of my most fun it's like i guess when you're happy because you because you you get funny and you let your hair down totally totally let's go with this okay uh next one do i eat my boogers and have you ever seen me eat my boogers never somebody asked this one and i was like i want her to answer because i want everybody to know that i've never eaten my boogers if you eat your boogers like i'm not judging but also like i want everybody to know that i've never done it okay what was my weirdest phase in life so far like whether it was like a fashion thing that i was doing or like maybe it's like activity that i was participating a lot like what was the weirdest one we i just thought of one when i was younger i used to wear costumes all the time oh that was fun i would literally wear a cat costume around all the time and it wasn't just that there was a horse one there was a horse one there was a cat one i was a [ __ ] furry i was a furry you were a dolphin like you yeah that went on for years it wasn't like it was just do you think i've ever kissed a boy before yeah that was a super cool try to guess how many and if you get it wrong then you don't get to know the answer and if you get it right then i'll say that you got it right if that makes sense okay um we actually don't know nine no okay moving on um darn it i know maybe we'll no you don't you you lost so you don't get to know was it too many no okay no no but it wasn't it was more than that okay it was a lot more than that if you could choose a job for me that's not what i'm doing now what would it be an entrepreneur is what the job is so you think i would have like came up with some sort of like killer diehard app you know i know you wanted to be an anesthesiologist you know when you were younger and and i can see you doing that but i can't that was a weird i don't know what i was thinking that's not i think you you liked uh when you experienced having an anesthesiologist you really like right so it was like i wanted to do it because i wanted to give other people a good experience right it was less but i think i forgot that you have to go to school for 15 years yeah right okay what's the naughtiest thing you've ever caught me doing um oh my god i had a coloring on the wall behind the couch and then i yelled at you and scared the [ __ ] that was really scary one time i was sleeping in and you you were playing with a candy and i was putting my finger in the hot candle wax and then you it's somehow like the match fell on the carpet or something and you were you came running oh i almost caught the apartment on fire but you know what i was doing was i was playing with matches because i kept like lighting the candle and then letting the wax melt and then i'd stick my fingers in it and you know have so much fun so satisfying and then one of the times i lit a match it flew out of my hand and it fell onto the carpet and then i blew it out and even though it didn't cause a fire i still felt the need to tell her and that's the thing though you would do things you would do things or experiment with things but you would always run and tell me about it i know okay see that's such a good kid uh how did you feel when i didn't go to high school for all four years and i graduated i was relieved relieved i was happy hi have you tasted my coffee brand and do you like it or do you not like it i've taste i mean i drink it every day it's my favorite coffee it's y'all and i didn't even say that no it truly is tell me a time that i embarrassed you one time we were dog sitting and i was writing out like i was writing out like um a note to the person for when they came home i just needed to explain a lot of things but it like i wrote it like four or five times because it i kept messing up and i wanted it to be you know like i just wanted to look good we saw him afterwards and you told him because i like she wrote the note five times that's naughty it's like you would call me out in front of people like you do that [ __ ] all the time have you ever no no don't even say it don't even say that and i was just like okay okay that's even no that's bad and that can't even go on the internet so we're just gonna move on um tell me something embarrassing that you've seen me do where you're like oh my god she just embarrassed herself or like something that you think i did that was embarrassing i see the thing is i don't care what people think so i don't i don't pers i don't have that perspective you know like i know like you've been embarrassed when you you're waving at someone because you think they're waving at you i literally will call her immediately and i'll be like i can't do this i just waved at somebody and it wasn't like it'll be dumb [ __ ] and i've seen it happen like in person if we if you were my age do you think we would be friends no have you ever thought i looked like genuinely look like [ __ ] have you ever seen me like come out of my room and like look like [ __ ] and like i was like do i look okay and you're like ah yes no um i i just come on i mean everybody has their moments right like um but you've never been like oh my god that's [ __ ] mortifying no i for one thing i mean just to be honest you're just not ugly period and a story and you never have been like but i'm also your mom and so like i you know i can never look at you that way okay why don't you rate my hygiene out of ten a seven eight maybe okay okay so talk about where i could improve uh washing your hands um because i just don't think you wash your hands enough eating like you're eating your food with your fingers but you haven't washed your hands in like three days what do you think that we have in common you know maybe you i just i rubbed off on you because i'm a workaholic and a perfectionist and i think that well i hate that we have that in common i wish we could both throw that away i know we're torturing ourselves yeah every day we don't have the same taste in men no i'm petting declan by the way i know you're doing it do you think i would be a good or a bad girlfriend and if you were my age and were a boy would you date me i think you would be a really good girlfriend um because you're super loyal and you care what was the second question if you were a guy and you were my age would you date me yes or no and it's a yes or no question yes really okay fair you should because i am your daughter so i would

responsibilities are kind of like you're the only one here to do them the first thing we argue about is like me neglecting to do my chores on time even though i don't live at home anymore yeah okay oh

-emma chamberlain",2020-12-13T17:14:58Z,236572,5264947,6879,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi [Music] today we're filming my video in my car because my home is being worked on so i can't really film in there because there's so many people and not so many people but there's like people working on my house so i need to kind of be out of the house so we're filming on a random street and the lighting is not even that good it's kind of bad like i should probably go somewhere else but i've also been driving around for 20 minutes trying to find a good place this is obviously not a good place though i feel like this lighting's [ __ ] awful also we're just gonna be looking at this red van for the entire time no but here's what we're doing in today's video today i'm going to be reviewing fashion trends i asked you guys on my instagram to send me a bunch of fashion trends that you're either into or you hate and then i was like okay i'm gonna tell you what i think about i don't know why you'd want to watch this like i don't know why my opinion matters if you like a piece of clothing then wear it shouldn't listen to anybody else i definitely don't like i will literally wear [ __ ] that people think is ugly all the time i don't care like if i like it then i like it and that's the end of that i don't know i'm just gonna share my opinion and you know give my little two cents so this is a better spot let's get right into it okay actually before we get right into it we're gonna talk about our sponsor of today's video which is the real real and i love them before we get started i'm gonna show you a few things i got off of the real reals website vintage louis vuitton beautiful great condition another vintage louis vuitton again great condition cheaper than it normally would have been if i bought it at retail price and also this cute little louis vuitton mini little cute mini bag i'm obsessed with the real real it's where i buy all of my luxury consignment products i'm obsessed i've been using the real world forever it's a luxury consignment store they have an app they have a website they have a location in la two in new york one in san francisco and one in chicago i believe i just remembered all around they have so many different stores they have louis vuitton reformation redone jeans dior givenchy marc jacobs like any any luxury brand you can imagine the real real probably has it on their site it can be up to 90 off retail value on the real real the real real has a team of experts that authenticate every single piece so that you know you're not getting ripped off which is also very important another fun thing is that i made a curated list with the real real of my favorite products on their website right now and you can shop it if you'd like i picked some stuff that's great for holiday gifting great for yourself if you want to gift yourself something overall cute stuff we got a lot of louis vuitton on there because that's my favorite we got some fendi on there i think we have a few dior things on there i made it fun click the link in my description to shop the curated pics i picked out with the real real and if you click the link in my description you're going to get 25 off your first order and another 20 off if you use the code real real the 20 off only works on select items but code real thank you to the real world for sponsoring this video i really appreciate it because i love you guys and i've been using you for my whole life okay let's get back to the video now it's kind of funny that i'm like doing a fashion video today and i'm just wearing like a fuzzy like i'm not i'm literally wearing pjs oh [ __ ] i also didn't have coffee yet today so i'm feeling like [ __ ] maybe we'll go get one later but i don't like cheating on my own coffee company that makes me feel bad first thing is low-rise jeans i don't like i don't like low-rise jeans but my main thing with low-rise jeans is that i don't feel confident in them i just feel exposed and like my butt crack is going to come out at like any moment i feel like fashion is all about feeling comfortable and cute and i don't feel comfortable or low rise hi i don't feel comfortable or cute in low-rise jeans if somebody else felt confident happy and cool in them i'm not i don't think that they look ugly you know what i'm saying i also have ptsd because i used to wear low rise pants as a middle schooler and as a child and literally every time i would be sitting in class like my butt crack would be coming out of my pants like it was not pleasant baguette bags i looked this up because i didn't even know what that meant but it seems to be like little cute bags like this one that i got from the real world thank you these are amazing i love these i know that they're really trendy i know a lot of people are wearing them i know it's like kind of a hot thing and i even saw like a few things on twitter being like can we like start using normal bags again or maybe i didn't see that that could have been my imagination but i feel like i saw a tweet like that i think that these are great because they fit right over your shoulder they're light they fit everything that you need it's like having a fanny pack it's like fanny pack size i think they're very convenient for the woman on the go that doesn't need a lot of things they add a little pop of you know detail to your outfit but it's not like this big intense bag that's getting in the way of your life who's that next somebody said painted jeans i think painted jeans are cute i really love like crazy cool patterned different pants because i feel like i tend to just stick to denim and like just wear boring denim every single day painting clothing is always cool because it's always going to be unique and i like that i think that that's you know even better if you paint your own pants as long as you know it's not super like come on we can stop with doing flames on jeans unless you like it listen this is just my opinion you guys can take it or leave it painted jeans are a yes for me next somebody said sweater vests which is literally like my favorite thing on this planet the reason why i like them is because you can layer them it's a great way to layer without like fear of getting too sweaty and it adds dimension to an outfit okay add some extra patterns add some extra color but it's not as hot and sweaty but it still keeps your core warm beyond functionality they just look cool i like the preppiness and the classiness of a sweater vest i love how many things you can put under it you could put nothing under it you could put for the summertime i was doing that in the summer a collared shirt turtleneck i think sweater vests are [ __ ] amazing and so cool and so fun and so underrated although i feel like they are kind of becoming in style now so happy to see it also you can thrift sweater vests for like 45 cents because so many old [ __ ] like i'm talking about how many 80 year old men were like you know what i don't need the sweater vest anymore but they had like 50 of them look at you now you have sweater vests off the wazoo they're everywhere next we have baggy jeans i like baggy jeans because i like when my jeans feel like sweatpants i mean it's kind of a hard thing though sometimes because if you're wearing like baggy jeans in a baggy top i like to play with that sometimes but it's really a risky thing because it's hard to not look like you're drowning in your clothes sometimes baggy jeans you need to wear like a belt with them or like whatever so that they're not falling off and that can be kind of annoying and uncomfortable but overall i think that they can look really cool and i really like them so i think baggy jeans are yes why do i like everything so far okay somebody said layering clothes and listen of course i like layering clothes but i think that the thing is layering clothes is hard in la and it's a lot easier in places like new york and stuff where it's cold it's a very tell-tale sign about whether or not somebody gets it it's not easy to layer clothes so if you can figure out a way to do it and make it look really dope then you then that's impressive like it's an impressive thing always layer i think it's important somebody said ugg boots i don't think that ugg boots are cute but yet i wear them all the time they sent me a pair and i can't take those [ __ ] off but i'm not wearing them to be fashionable though this is not a fashionable thing this is about convenience and comfort same thing with these i wear these all the time but am i wearing them because i think that they add something cute to the outfit absolutely not i'm wearing them because they feel good but i still think that they're not like repulsive like i wouldn't wear something that i thought was repulsive maybe wearing them with like a juicy tracksuit just to like fully give a throwback moment like i think that could be a fashionable moment why not next somebody said yoga pants it doesn't really make sense like why i like that but i feel like a 80s aerobics teacher wearing this like kind of extreme silhouette of legging where it splits out at the bottom and i just feel like i like that energy of it like i like feeling like a [ __ ] 80s workout class instructor off duty you could wear it with like a really cute top and like even some little like kitten heels and like i feel like that could be kind of cool as long as it doesn't have like some big athletic logo on it next somebody said new balance trainers i'm really on the fence because i've seen some people wear it and make it look so great and i and i love that for them and i whatever but i just can't there's something blocking there's a mental block there for me and i think what it is is that the problem with the new balance sneakers is i feel like the way that they just fit in general is kind of clunky in a way if new balance shoes had a sound it would be like burn bearer burper like that's the sound that like my brain hears when i see the shoe next somebody said e-girl e-boy fashion not really a fan and i know that like some people would argue that i had a phase that was pretty short-lived for me i don't really know what the fate what kind of phase i was going through honestly i think what it was is that i wanted to start getting into jewelry but i didn't want to wear gold jewelry because i felt like everybody wore gold jewelry but then it turned out everybody was also wearing silver [ __ ] jewelry so i don't know what i was trying to do there can we not like leaf blow i'm so mad that this [ __ ] is coming up on me with his [ __ ] leaf blower right now i know it's not his fault but i'm still annoyed anyway i don't actually really know ex what e girl or eboy fashion is it's almost like if you took like the scene you know and like it was like the whole like scene and emo kids uh back in the day around like you know 2010 or whatever it's like that but it's like making it prettier though i just think that it's very oversaturated i feel like so many people have done it already and it just kind of it's just so not fresh anymore and i also feel like it's something that's a trend it's not something that's timeless to me i don't feel like the whole e-girl e-boy thing is timeless i feel like it's something that's gonna be it'll it will be dead before we know it somebody said cow print i really like cow print but i think the problem with prince is that when they get really popular they can also become boring it catches your eye and it's something different but when a lot of when like a certain print caliper being a good example becomes really popular it kind of loses its excitement and its sparkle and i think that's kind of happened in my opinion with cow print where it's like you can find cow print items so easily now that it's like what's the point whereas maybe like a few years ago or something when cow print wasn't in when you would see somebody wearing cow print you're like oh [ __ ] that's kind of dope whereas now it's like everybody has cow print pants there's nothing wrong with wearing something that a lot of people are wearing i do it all the time sometimes i see something like you know that i've seen a lot of people wear but i really like it i'm not going to stop myself from wearing it like platform doc martens everybody in their [ __ ] mom has platform doc martens but that doesn't mean that i'm not going to wear it because i like them a lot and so i will wear them socks and sandals is it a fashion thing though not necessarily but at the same time i kind of think it's dope like there's something about it that it's like i actually think it can look dope like i've worn socks and sandals with jeans before and like a cute top and i mean i don't think it's necessarily fashionable but it felt good and it weirdly didn't look bad so i was like why am i gonna fight this like i'll just go with it call me crazy next we have patchwork jeans i like them but similar thing with the cow print it was like i liked them better when like it was like different but i also think that they're cute i mean i think it's fun i think it kind of gives like a it's kind of a little hippie in a way and i kind of like that and i think you know they're fun and cute and i don't have a problem with them at all but i also think that so many people wore them that i'm like okay like can we move on somebody said monochromatic outfits which if you don't know what that means it means like an outfit that's all the same color i love it i need every single color in my outfit to tie together even if i'm like going to sleep right now i'm wearing this and this matches this perfectly like i i have to that's how my brain works and i cannot live any other way so for me a monochromatic outfit is a [ __ ] dream come true because it's all the same color i don't have to think about anything i think monochromatic outfits are very fun i don't see a problem with it somebody said collar under shirts i love it it just adds this layer of like preppiness that i just am so into i'm getting into the preppy vibe i just want to look like i [ __ ] play croquet i don't know i mean i love it i don't think you can go wrong somebody said always wearing sweats i don't see why we can't make sweats fashionable why not like let's make this trendy let's make this as trendy as we possibly can so that we can all just [ __ ] wear sweats all the time that's a dream come true and it can actually look cool i think the key is to find a pair of sweatpants that fit you really well because i think the sweatpants that i wear to bed are not the sweatpants that i'm to wear out and about i mean we see haley bieber do it all the time i feel like she does that all the time and she always makes it look badass she'll wear like a big expensive coat over it and make it look so nice obviously you don't need an expensive code to do it but i'm saying like it's it's a thing it works i like it somebody said biker shorts i don't know i don't like it i just really don't like it don't [ __ ] be mad at me because there's photos of me that exist of me wearing biker shorts i just don't like it similar to the e girl eboy thing like we're gonna look back and be like why the [ __ ] were we wearing biker shorts the only exception being i did see a photo of lady diana wearing biker shorts and it did look [ __ ] incredible somebody said corsets corsets can be very beautiful i've seen some very beautiful corsets but i don't know i just think it's so uncomfortable it looks good but like i just don't find it to be worth it they can look beautiful it's i'm torn but no next is tie-dye no i really don't like tie-dye i hate it actually for some reason but then again i do have like a few things that are technically tie-dye but they're not like tie-dye tie-dye they're like they're like kind of splotchy patterns made with different dye but it's not like traditional tie-dye i just think it can look tacky too easily but if we're talking about more of like tie-dye that's like just patches of color that are like more abstract and look less like tie-dye and more like just a cool watercolor looking design that's different traditional tie-dye is a [ __ ] no for me i hate it next is cheetah print again some cheetah prints look so [ __ ] awful in like jersey shore as [ __ ] and then some cheetah prints look somehow elevated and i don't know the distinction i don't know what makes an elevated cheetah print and like versus a tacky cheetah print but i think it's almost you have to base it off of feel and if you can do that then i think you go crazy with the cheetah print and have fun with it 80s crazy ass fun pattern sweaters i really love crazy like retro-y patterns i've always loved it i know you're talking about 80s crazy patterns but i think that the 90s crazy patterns i think that that's dead to me i loved that like i was obsessed with like tacky 90s patterns for like a year and now i hate it i'm ready to move on to something else like i'm kind of over it somebody said 90s mesh tops especially jean paul gaultier i don't know how to say that last name i love it i love the mesh tops i think they're really pretty my only problem is i don't know what to wear underneath them because it's hard to find the perfect bralette to wear underneath it and i really struggle with that but i'm into it somebody said jordans i don't know if they're really my style anymore for me the jordans are like when i want to be more like street style vibe and then like doc martens are more when i'm like trying to be like what even would be the word i don't know like the rest of my closet doesn't match my jordan somebody said big colorful rings i love big colorful chunky jewelry i think this is the next thing i just started trying to do a little bit of that it has a green stone although i'm starting to see it become a thing so i need to [ __ ] hop on that one because i really love big colorful jewelry i think it's really cool somebody said chunky filas i've always hated these and i'm so sorry because i'm gonna offend people that i know and love even probably but i've always [ __ ] hated them and i take pride in the fact that i've never ever gotten them i never bought them i never considered buying them like i've always thought that they were the most repulsive shoe on this [ __ ] planet okay next somebody said corduroy pants i love corduroy it's a classic thing you can't go wrong they're like a very like soft like oh like i read a lot of books vibes somebody said tennis skirts i love tennis skirts i do feel like i'm kind of bored of them though i need to kind of branch out with the skirt thing because i really only ever wore tennis skirts but i really want to start wearing more skirts because i feel like i could have fun with it but it's just scary and unknown territory for me somebody said bell bottom pants i hate them a slightly slightly flared boot cut fine bell bottom it's a no from me i really don't want to see that ever get popular again i really don't like it but a little boot cut yeah sure but no bell bottom for me flannel shirts i remembered them from my childhood from going to country concerts and wearing a flannel because i was at a country concert just going to the concert to kiss boys that's the memory i have that's the association i have with flannel shirts which like makes me sick like those memories aren't really very fond but then i started people seeing people style them in really cool ways and i was like [ __ ] it i'm gonna bring it back in a different way i want to wear flannels because they're a button up that has a cool pattern on it like that's the way i'm looking at it now somebody said the color brown i love styling the color brown it's my favorite color brown everything like i love it and i love monochromatic brown outfits like i'm obsessed it's like my favorite color to wear right now best [ __ ] color ever to style and i love i just love it somebody said leg warmers i just don't really like it i would rather scrunch down socks i really just don't like the leg warmer thing watch me wear them in like two months but i just think that they're kind of like i don't know it's just like kind of extra to me like i don't i don't love it i don't love it but i also i'm not judging somebody said juicy tracksuit i think it's fun i don't know if i want to hop on this one i got tempted a few times i almost ordered a juicy jacket you know it's a fun like girly moment like where you feel like your pair is hilt and then i get it i'm not against them but i don't think i'm gonna hop on it just because you know this video is gonna be 45 minutes long like this is gonna be a [ __ ] podcast i'm gonna go quicker north face puffer jackets yes from me do i think that they're necessarily super fashionable i think you could probably find a more fashionable puffer jacket but personally i think that they're the best ones less for fashion and more for convenience but i think you can also style them in a cool way somebody said fuzzy bags i feel like this is a trend that's gonna die but i think they're cute i think they're cute but i think they're gonna it's not gonna be a thing forever like we're gonna see that disappear in like a year fingerless gloves i [ __ ] with this i haven't seen a lot of people wearing fingerless gloves i'm gonna order like a [ __ ] five dollar pair on amazon i think it would be a cool winter look to be like wearing a full like puffer jacket with like sweaters under it beanie and then have like the [ __ ] fingerless gloves i think that'd look really badass and keep your hands warm zebra pants i don't know i feel like zebra print for me just reminds me of being a middle schooler and so that's kind of where my mental block is cowboy boots i love cowboy boots i think they're so cute i think that wearing them in a way that's like not westerny is just like so fun and interesting and like i'm into it i'm into it i approve somebody said long skirts i want to get into long skirts i don't like short skirts because sometimes i'm just like not in the mood to be like really exposed and i want to feel like comfortable but i feel like long skirts with like some doc martens to kind of edge it up a little bit could be really fun somebody said hi boots i like them but not for me i just i don't know well okay do you know what let's actually let's narrow this down over the knee boots are a [ __ ] no from me i've never liked them i hate them but if we're talking about like boots that like are the ones that go like to right here like more like a go-go boot kind of style more like a go-go boot i can get behind i just need to get more into skirts before i like really go there oversized glasses yes i'm done with the tiny little mini glasses i still wear them here and there because i like have a lot of pairs and some of them i really like i actually think i'm more into the big like kind of 60s really big goggle looking glasses i think it's so good like you can add that to an outfit and it just makes your outfit go from like okay this is cool to like oh [ __ ] she's like not [ __ ] around somebody said kitten heels i like them i think the little kitten heels are cute especially because they're easy to walk in i don't like high heels i think the kitten heel thing is just so much more approachable i think the kitten heel is the perfect happy medium and also gives like you know 90 supermodel off duty vibes to me and that might be fully wrong but that's what it gives me in my mind and to finish off this video somebody said mullets i love mullets i would fully get a [ __ ] mullet if i could i know it's like something that we're gonna look back on and cringe i remember growing up like any time i would be watching like an old movie and somebody would have a mullet i would be like ugh that's so ugly but now i want one it's just so cool and i think that people pull them off with such grace i don't know if i could but i really like them so i think if you wanted to get a mullet this is your sign to get them all you live once wait that's a good point actually you do literally live once maybe i should get a [ __ ] mullet and like send it like it'll grow back that's all for today's video i hope that you guys enjoyed i realize now that i pretty much like everything you know what before this video ends i'm going to name a few things a few clothing trends that i hate because i feel like this video needs some negativity neon i hate neon i hate everything neon stop stuff that like people that like love horoscopes wear that has like all the moons and like tapestry types of things on it no i don't like that for some reason you can't get me to wear a [ __ ] skinny jean i also hate v-necks stop don't do that ever no camo i hate it you know what i'm done thank you guys for watching i hope that you enjoyed hearing my opinions please share your opinions in the comments what you guys feel about this stuff are you into it do you hate it i love you all thank you for watching i've been sitting in my car in a random neighborhood for two hours now here's your forehead kiss i love you all very much i

-emma chamberlain",2020-12-06T19:38:01Z,281647,5207715,11288,am i good at this [Music] it's coffee time i'm in san francisco i'm visiting my hometown i'm not in san francisco i'm actually like south of san francisco but i'm in my hometown that's the bed that i grew up in i slept in here's my dad how's the drums go it wasn't really flowing today fidget check i'm being of course this exists but i didn't know about this world of fans hi red and link i'm back home to be honest i've never needed it more in my life my mental health was struggling in la a lot i needed a more simple life do you know what i'm saying like since i've gotten here i have showered once and guess what go with the shower [ __ ] rumors about me i don't give a [ __ ] when you guys are home i bet you shower a lot less too i'm playing the drums i'm going to the beach i'm going to san francisco and getting coffee and going to thrift stores life is so simple nobody asks me to hang out no hollywood fix it's a dream it's a dream come true not to mention i've been driving through san francisco and i'm listening to the music that i used to listen to back in like 2017 and just bawling my eyes out i'm excited to vlog sfm is back i literally just woke up um and my first stop of the day is coffee one issue is that coffee around directly where my father lives is no good so i have to drive a solid 20 minutes to get good coffee which is fine because this place is right by the beach i get to get my coffee and sit by the beach what more could you [ __ ] want i hate to get all sappy around here but i was getting so [ __ ] sad in la and it you know what i can't exactly put a finger on what it was like i don't know exactly what was like bumming me out being back in the bay area honestly this is the first time i've ever came back to my hometown and appreciated it normally i come back and i'm like [ __ ] this place i got too many bad memories but now i'm like old and now i'm old and gray and i can come back and i can be like you know what this place is actually really great there's no open bathrooms in san francisco right now finding an open bathroom is like literally finding i don't know i couldn't come up with a joke it's hard to find a bathroom in san francisco and i keep having these like poo emergencies it's 46 degrees that's why i'm wearing a puffer jacket i actually got this puffer jacket yesterday hall check no i missed my exit okay that's my sign that i need to focus [Music] i really wish that either number one i was really good at surfing or number two it wasn't 50 degrees out because all these people surfing i feel really left out i do my dad's literally surfing out there with him i don't even know where he is he took a different car we do our own thing we're a crazy family like that like he would teach me but it's 50 degrees i'm so cold even in all of this no surfy for me i'll go home and play drums instead oh my god the camera angle's so bad whatever ah that's kind of fire back to bed okay everybody we're on our way so i have a little plan for the day okay um so when i used to go to the city basically i live about 20 minutes away from san francisco and so when i was younger i used to go there all the time and if you guys watch my old videos i used to go to san francisco all the time and like hang out there and film it and whatever so i decided that today i'd go back to some of my old favorite spots number one we're gonna go to a coffee shop called revelly i believe i still to say i've been going there for years and i don't know what the name of the coffee shop is so that we're gonna go there first and then after that we're going to go to a thrift store called held over that has really good stuff and a large selection of stuff i think i need a little bit of retail therapy today and i say that every day so it's kind of lost its meaning so we're gonna do that then i'm gonna go get food somewhere which i don't know i always get really anxious about like trying new places and i have like a lot of restaurants that i used to like when i was younger but then part of me also is like emma go somewhere new there's so many cool places to eat in the city try something new but then another part of me is like okay but you know what you like already but then another part of me is like yeah but try something new god only knows but we'll have find something fun and yummy and then i'll probably get coffee again i'm literally doing something that i always loathe when other people do in their vlogs which is explain exactly what they're going to do it's like okay well why don't you just show it i know ah oh my god honestly being back in san francisco makes me want to move and i know that's crazy i'm really excited for the day that i can move out of la i absolutely can't wait and i don't know why i hate it so much and i'm not hating it because i'm like trying to be like oh i'm different and i hate l.a i don't know why i hate it and i don't want to hate it when you're younger i feel like you romanticize like la and new york and you romanticize like your life as an adult i romanticize the the fast-paced lifestyle of of l.a there's like just famous people everywhere it's so cool no it isn't like the way that the air feels in northern california is so different it feels like winter here whereas in l.a it never feels like winter there's no season so it's nice to feel a little bit of crispy in the air it's nice to have to wear a puffer jacket i enjoy it i do and i never thought that this would happen i didn't i never thought it would i was always like there's no way i'm ever gonna give a [ __ ] about northern california it's so shitty i hate it and i hate everybody here yes but also you'll appreciate it again one day and you'll realize the beauty of it and that's what i'm dealing with now i know a lot of you guys miss my videos from going to san francisco i do too i mean it was a really special time but at the same time i had to move to la for my career and you know to progress and to meet people that were doing the same thing as me it was very lonely for me here because there were people around me here that like understood what i was doing and then i moved to la and met youtubers and i was like wait i actually don't like that either so then but uh the moral of the story is appreciate your hometown i appreciate san francisco and i miss the good old days but at the same time we can remember them for what they are whatever and also i can't wait to move out of la one day who knows where i'm gonna go uh we're gonna have a fun day today and i'm excited to spend it with you guys it's like we're going on a date date date with emma oh my god i keep doing the [ __ ] tongue thing going to get my coffee now it's a lot easier to vlog in public with a mask so i'm getting a little bit stirred up though so maybe i'll stop can i do an iced latte with almond milk mmm oh this isn't made with almond milk i'm gonna need to get a new one i had to do the dreadful hey can you remake my drink because you put milky in it anyway he was very gracious about it now i got my iced almond latte i already feel my morning poop sorry i'll just stop there okay time to go to our next location it's kind of hot do i take my jacket off it's like 64 now we're not in antarctica you know what i mean like what am i doing here puffer jacket a sweater and a turtleneck like we can relax probably we're going to the thrift store now praying that i can find parking i'm also kind of hungry but i'm so indecisive about what i want that i don't think i'm ready to make that decision yet a salad with like oh my god oh story time the first day i got here um i went to a coffee shop and i got a quinoa salad it was quinoa kale cucumber avocado sesame seeds whatever the [ __ ] dressing they put on it i know that quinoa doesn't really agree with me but i was like you know what i haven't had quinoa in a really long time maybe like my stomach would be fine with it now like these things change all the time my stomach's super unpredictable sometimes things bother it sometimes things don't so i was like you know what i'm gonna give it a chance the salad sounds really good i like quinoa let's send it when i tell you that i've never had worse stomach pain in my life i've never had worse stomach pain in my life this salad was delicious but quinoa just is so not good for me i was in bed and i felt pregnant i felt constipated but also not constipated like imagine your body like having a bad reaction to quinoa i'm trying to do good things for my body i'm trying to get in my grains what the [ __ ] is up with that like if i was eating like a chipotle burrito and it gave me diarrhea yeah of course it gives me diarrhea but no i'm eating quinoa i mean the amount of foods oh what the [ __ ] my car just rolled backwards the amount of food that gives me stomach pain is like embarrassing majority of the food i eat on a day-to-day basis hurts my stomach like i love cauliflower absolutely rips up my stomach apart i eat it anyway because i like it brussels sprouts and kale [ __ ] up [ __ ] up my stomach hot sauce [ __ ] up my stomach i eat a lot of hot sauce what's up with that anyway see you guys at the thrift store quinoa okay so just did my first run at the first store did really well the place was really good the guy told me that everything in there is from germany so that's why there's such a cool selection so that's exciting so we did two bags there and now i just walked past another place that looks really good and i didn't want to carry these bags around so i dropped them off but now we're gonna go to the second place also i am so awkward filming in front of people that's why i'm using my iphone you would think after three years four years i would have gotten used to it i'm back i did a lot of damage my coffee is melted i'm gonna drink it anyway savage mode okay so into two stores did damage at both honestly the thrifting here is better than i remembered and the prices are better than i remember first thing i got was this um this reminds me of a dior top and i'm obsessed with it like how funny is it next i love this shirt well i honestly got it because it's really soft it's this big i don't know what it says on it so hopefully it's not something offensive i always worry about that whenever i get something in a different language on my shirt i'm always like [ __ ] i don't know what it says like i hope it's not like for like a [ __ ] meat slaughtering company or something i don't know got the shirt i thought it was cute it has little clowns on it and it says something then i've been looking for like light jackets to wear because it's getting cold in la but i don't need big thick jackets so i got this pale yellow one that's really cute and nice and cropped but then we also got a similar yellow one that's more oversized silhouette so i got this cashmere sweater for 30 bucks it's not bad for cashmere and it's a little pink v-neck i also got this jacket has cute plaid on the inside um it just honestly will be nice i honestly why did i buy so many jackets like that last but not least from the first store i got a pair of wranglers and honestly they might not fit the first store was really great i'm very pleased with my purchases here the second store was good too but not as much success this place had a dressing room which eliminated a lot of options because then i tried things on and i was like oh wait that looks like [ __ ] next door i got these 80s corduroy kind of like baggy pants i want to wear these when i'm having like a small top big bottom moment and then i also got this because i honestly it's pretty boring but i oh my god it literally says that this was from target okay well target you slayed wait did i pay i paid 36 dollar and then last but not least i got this really cute kind of like a little crop jacket with a velvet that was all i got from the second store to be honest i think i'm done shopping for the day i've been shopping for about two hours now which is long but i definitely don't want to go home anytime soon so i'm kind of like trying to figure out what my next move is kind of hungry kind of not hungry because kind of hungry i'll figure it out y'all it's been like 20 minutes and i cannot decide on a place to eat i don't even know what genre of food i want what do i want this sweater turtleneck combo doesn't make sense to me being in san francisco is so refreshing because i've not cared about my outfit for one second the whole time i've been here i have a restaurant in mind but it's kind of far away wait let's see how far away it is let's see this place's menu it's called judalicious they have an acai bowl chili that sounds good but it also sounds like gas i'm gonna go here oh my god they have cool stuff it's definitely gonna give me gas but it's a risk i'm willing to take this is my favorite outlet or not la this is my favorite sf restaurant i just forgot if i would still like it so this is exciting going back to the roots so i just saw somebody walking a cat on a leash and it's giving me ideas holy [ __ ] that scared the [ __ ] we're back i picked up my food i got two different kinds of soup because i was like listen whatever one i like more i'll eat now and then whatever when i don't like as much i'll eat later for dinner because it's a good food to have for dinner so let's try our soups first we have this one i don't even know what it is one was like a vegetable one and one was a chili god it looks healthy and scary looks like diarrhea oh i'm not gonna like this it's okay but i'm probably gonna give it to my dad it's seasoned very well my issue with it is i don't like when there's leafy greens cooked until they're soggy and there's a lot of that going on that soup so alas now we're trying the chili okay mmm the chili is fire what is in here oh a piece of toast with something orange on it okay i don't really know about now we have the main course which is my salad oh that looks delicious salad is good lots of avocado and carrots is that an onion i don't like onions but whatever i'm gonna eat this and then go home i'm back home all right that's enough that's enough of that for the day back to bed i'm going to lay in bed for the remainder of the day it's like 6 p.m but before i do that i want to do a show and tell of things in my room number one we have this popcorn funny story behind it my dad and i used to hide it in random places around the house and surprise each other with it he would put it on the back of the toilet under my pillow or i would put it in his laundry basket it doesn't make sense i know but that's something we would do so that's one show-and-tell item oh my god this was my first hair straightener look at this [ __ ] it's pink oh my god what is this this was my favorite robe look how tiny it is i sewed this skirt at sewing camp when i was younger i also sewed this what is this it's actually kind of cute wait low-key this is kind of cute these were hand-me-downs from one of my cousins these little abercrombie shorts they're so tiny oh my god that's terrifying last two artifacts of the day i used to be obsessed with painting pottery so this was one of the things i painted as you can see was very good i also was obsessed with making things out of duct tape so i tried to make a little tray out of duct tape clearly it didn't really work out very well but it does say my name actually my cousin might have made this for me but i know i was obsessed with making duct tape stuff too so easily could have been me i figured out how to play the beginning of a vampire weekend song i don't know if i'm even doing it right but i thought i would show you okay so i can only really do it once without it sounding bad thank you guys for watching this video i had a lot of fun we're hanging out we're back home it feels good i hope that you guys are all having an amazing day and an amazing holiday season i know that it's pretty hard to have anything relatively amazing right now with the state of yeah but we're gonna get through all of it together and i love you guys and um you know what i'll talk to you next week that was your forehead kiss also do you think if i like became a drummer girl like do you think that could be a new personality trait for me i feel like it would give me some sort of like self-worth to have a hobby so my dad says so so let me know what you guys think forehead kiss number two totally got caught you off guard i'll see you later you

-emma chamberlain",2020-11-29T19:29:34Z,252684,5273999,8150,[Music] [Applause] [Music] good morning it's 7 30 in the morning i'm going on a road trip today by myself i'm really excited listen i've been in la for almost a year long i've been here for so long and i'm getting really depressed i'm gonna be honest this week is thanksgiving my family may not do anything due to covid but i still decided that i needed to go home because it's just time i just need to get out of here man it's just not good i want to be able to walk around and live my life without constant fear of seeing another youtuber around maybe a tick talker or getting hollywood fixed like i just want peace i think my espresso machine is broken because recently it's been a [ __ ] to get this thing here oh my god i'm already getting frustrated the other thing is i've been very uninspired in la like i have not been able to film a video in like two weeks i couldn't do it i'll just give you more information when we're going there i'm gonna have nothing to talk about for six hours i don't know why i'm using all of my tokens now oh my god i'm so tired i'm making a latte now because i know i'm gonna need coffee throughout my road trip and i don't wanna have to stop again so i'm gonna go get a coffee from my favorite la coffee shop before i leave and then for the second half of the trip i'm gonna have my channel and coffee and it's great um also there's something very comforting about going to a coffee shop i don't know why i'm explaining myself um but yeah why do i keep sticking my tongue out like that i literally expect a virtual slap in the face every time i go please i have my coffee for later this will stay cold all day and then i'm gonna go get a coffee now actually that's not really a good idea huh let's really think about that emma no because then i'm gonna be peeing too much so do you know what we're just gonna stick to one coffee we're ready chamberlaincoffee.com in about an hour i'll be on nice and woken up and less depressed i think the second that i exit la my mental health will improve greatly the second i leave like i think it's gonna be that easy okay let's get going [Music] it's go time we need gas though guys i'm gonna cry i forgot my coffee i'm already like halfway to the gas station do i go back and get it oh my god i'm so [ __ ] stupid this is literally the most depressing thing that's ever happened to me am i being dramatic i need to go get it i forgot my coffee in there oh i'm almost back i mean i'm i'm a couple minutes out you want me to run in and get it bring it out here that would be awesome also i'm gonna get gas first so take your time and i'll text you when i get there thank god for that woman but just my luck you know i keep doing the tongue thing this was literally not a problem yesterday this just became a problem today i think it's because i'm nervous because i haven't filmed in a long time and because i feel a little bit depressed and so i'm like oh my god are people gonna see my depression through the screen but you know what you guys always accept me through all of my um through all of my issues and so i don't know why i think that i'm gonna be judged by y'all because it never has happened actually it has but i forgive you okay this is the [ __ ] craziest angle of 2020 what is going on whoever's driving that car is probably super hot i can tell look how many masks i have in my car number one number two oh this one's fun number three although the blue ones have a chemical in them they give me allergic reactions i don't know what that's about oh then we have this one this is uh skims one this one cute then we have this one so why do i have so many i'm crazy thank you mom welcome okay i'll see you in a week have a really good trip okay i will thank you thank you okay i'll call you probably six times all right everybody we're on our way first thing i want to talk about is view concerns i have i'm afraid of running out of gas and getting stranded uh that's number one number two i've not had my morning poop am i gonna have a safe and comfortable place to have my morning poop that's a huge fear for me number three i of course fear death which could come in many shapes and sizes but but now let's talk about what i'm excited about normally when i go home i stay at my mom's house but this year my mom is helping me with some things in la and i'm going to visit my dad at his house this is the house i grew up in and i've not stayed there in a really long time because i normally stay at my mom's house because it's easier and it's close to all my hometown friends but this year i can't even see my hometown friends i just farted i think being in la for too long is bad because it's like constantly being in a fishbowl because everybody knows each other and you're constantly seeing like other influencers and stuff like that and you know there's like hollywood fix around and all that it's like you have constant fear of being watched there's gonna probably be so many interesting artifacts at my dad's house i don't even think you guys have ever seen my childhood room so i'm so excited to share that part of me with you oh my god my camera's falling oh my god my camera's falling off oh this is such a bad start everybody behind me probably thinks i'm drunk by the way that i'm driving okay i'm turning the camera off because my camera's falling okay it's been about 20 minutes i have fixed my camera and i'm on my way i am already very bored like extremely bored already you know the regret's kind of setting in i'm gonna be on the same freeway for about 80 miles but i also think that this already 20 minutes into this road trip am i realizing the anxiety i'm having thinking that i'm not going to be able to sit and scroll on my phone if i need to you can go a few hours without your phone but i'm very addicted to my phone which i think may be another reason for my recent depression i'm arriving at my first issue i do think that my morning poop is arriving my fear is that i pull over i get to the bathroom wherever i end up finding one god only knows and then the poop doesn't want to come out i'm in pain right now oh wait i actually think that was a period cramp because i am on my period shocker that might have literally just been a period cramp and not my morning poop see this is why it's good they were that were thinking everybody were thinking i've been driving with these sunglasses on and when i wear them for like an instagram photo i wear them blowing my nose like this but when i'm driving i have to wear them all the way up on my face like this like they're [ __ ] goggles i'm not in la anymore but i'm like in the surrounding areas that like people live in that i know like it's not like i'm like super remote this would have been a perfect place to poop i'm looking at in the left there's like a chili's and a starbucks and all that missed opportunity i'm listening to red links podcast ear biscuits been watching their youtube videos since the very beginning and their podcast is very good and it makes me feel safe not the dumping again do i pull over and poop now or do i wait until it's a literal emergency and i'm like about to like go in my pants i think i'm gonna test my limits i think i'm gonna test my limits and wait until it's like an actual emergency i don't really have a reason why i just feel like that's the that's the kind of vibe i'm feeling today i feel like i'm driving to coachella right now day one's tomorrow can't wait to just listen to tim and paulo live you know what i feel like the tongue sticking out just now was like justified i don't feel like that was out of pocket i keep wanting to call people but i'm so nervous because i'm like i'm like anxious that i'm gonna call them and they're gonna be like emma like i actually am doing things today like can you not [ __ ] call me but like i'm lonely anyway bye i'm going away i'll see you when i go poop it has been 10 minutes and i if i don't go to the bathroom like i don't know what's gonna happen so i'm gonna see you in a second it has been about approximately three seconds since i last filmed all the bathrooms are closed because of obvious reasons i asked the guy at the gas station where the nearest bathroom was and he said to go to lowe's but the thought of like walking through a lows at nine in the morning is like really not something i want to do but there is an entire shopping center here and i know that it's a law that restaurants have to have bathrooms i don't know if that's in place right now but i'm about to find out i am going into a lowe's right now okay okay okay after i moved out of my parents house i never thought i'd have to go into a lowe's again just because that's something that like i would do with my dad to get like wood like every time i'd literally go to lowe's or home depot the one in my hometown i would just see my grandpa there like i feel like he just hung out there all right let's do this this place is so incredibly large that i've been looking for the bathroom for a very long time okay and i can't find it where's the bathroom oh my god [Music] [Applause] thank goodness oh my god he's wearing ugg boots too this brings me to present the sponsor of today's video honey thank you honey for

hours in i am a little bit tired i do have to pee a little bit i'm in an area where there is no bathroom inside i feel like i'm in a farm town right now which is unique sorry i zoomed in on my face because i don't know i'm enjoying the drive actually i like this a lot more than flying because i feel in control i feel like you know i get to look around at nature i have wi-fi i can call people if i want so i mean like i'm enjoying myself this is kind of inspiring me to do more road trips down the line because i feel like i always avoid it because i feel like i'm gonna be bored the only issue is that i am having severe back pain i'm literally so excited to get to my dad's house because he has a drum set in my room don't ask i don't know why i'm gonna spend at least an hour listening to music and figuring out how they play those songs on the drums and analyze it so when i get home maybe i'll immediately be able to play a song is it gonna work no i am still listening to podcasts though so that's been great um a few other things i've been thinking about number one wow actually really nothing i did spend a little bit of time thinking about how others perceive me when they meet me like do i look short what do i look like when i'm walking i've also been thinking about how different i look from the beginning of quarantine to now i mean like i look completely different i also was thinking about how we've been in quarantine for like a year how is that how is that even possible it feels like it just started yesterday the one thing i did do last night that kind of made me feel happy was i literally made like five tick tocks the fact that that made me feel happy concerning but i'm definitely not going to post another tick tock for another few months so excited for that excited to take a much-needed tick-tock break that's sarcasm there's literally cows on that mountain it's so beautiful small update i started listening to music i was like this is a good idea i just kept crying i'm not crying anymore you know i'll excuse the tongue this time too because i'm really just trying to lay in the mood here it was it was a happy cry that was like it was like gratefulness for things in my life i think anyway um i am three hours away i still have to pee yeah that's kind of where i'm at i care about people so much that i cry about it constantly that is so weird but it's only like three people in my life but still and i will literally cry about how much i love them and they have no idea and they never will why well because i will never ever show that type of vulnerability i also feel like i peed my pants a little bit like it just feels like that which is [ __ ] disgusting and i probably shouldn't say that you know what i knew that this whole clip was going to be like bad it was a bad idea when i turned the camera on i knew immediately just because i was crying when i turned it on i'm also listening to music from like my past like from like the past like three years and it's so nostalgic i did just burp i don't know if you heard it you probably did i read a comment the other day that was like i really love emma's videos but i just like think i need to unsubscribe because i literally get so disgusted when she burps into that i say if you can't handle me at my worst you don't deserve me at my best i have really bad digestion i'm constantly burping and farting speaking of that i honestly think a big reason why i like to be alone so much is because i refuse i will fart and burp my videos but i will not do it in front of people in real life and so constantly when i'm with people i'm like swallowing burps and like just trying not to fart constantly and i wonder if they notice like can they tell i'm clenching my ass okay i'll see you guys in an hour or when i pee next i do need to pee really bad so maybe that will be happening soon i might go back to crying to be honest i literally can't believe i just pulled my eyes out like that so anyway see ya okay it's been approximately 10 minutes um i'm now listening to claro i'm releasing emotions but not in the same way it's not like the crying thing it's just like i don't know something different but whatever i create these weird so random and so far-fetched scenarios in my head i just had a scenario about what if somebody called me who i admired what if there was a guy i liked or maybe it was like a new friend that like i just started becoming friends with and like what if they facetime me while i was in a gas station bathroom it's kind of chaotic because it's like everything's gross you don't want to touch anything and so you like balance your phone on your leg when you go to wipe your ass and then your phone falls into the toilet and then whoever you're on facetime with can see your poop how embarrassing would that be and what would you do oh my god i just peed a little bit i like how they put signs on the road that say like that there's food coming up at the next exit or that there's like a gas station although gas stations don't have bathrooms right now oh next exit food stop great that was honestly this is the first time i've seen that since so i think i manifested it guys don't forget the power of manifesting thanks i found a random restaurant and i have to pee so bad that i can't walk okay i went potty sorry for not really filming the experience it was an emergency back on the road now can't wait i guess i mean i have like three more hours uh my first camera battery is now eating the dust so we're putting in a new one yes i did come prepared today no that will probably never happen again i don't know why i was prepared today something weird came over me back on the road everybody i'm excited to hopefully cry some more laugh some more god only knows okay we're an hour and a half out now i do have to pee i'm hungry i'm grumpy i'm listening to music and just analyzing who i am as a person not like maybe the best activity all right everybody we're on the last hour i have to pee pretty bad and i'm also really hungry you know what's wrong with me i'm hangry i also look exhausted and like i'm on the verge of death right now i don't look so good i feel pretty proud that i haven't like talked to that many people on the phone this whole time like i don't need nobody guess what i'm here and i have two fun things to show you number one i have fails let's try it very nostalgic i haven't had that in a really long time although i do feel like my at-home coffee recipe is kind of unbeatable but you know and then i also have asian bombs it's my favorite meal that i eat here good vibes honestly it feels very fall here whereas it does not feel fall at all in la so this is kind of nice like i actually feel like the air is crisp here it feels a lot more normal and more cute and fun [Music] okay good i almost just choked on my food i'm gonna eat this and come back hold on guys we're in the final stretch i'm 10 minutes away i'm fed i have my coffee i'm excited to be here i enjoy this i'm gonna rate my this road trip experience six and a half out of ten i would give it a seven but i was having such bad back pain that that kind of took down a half of a point every time i had to go to the bathroom i had to go so bad that it was like hurting so that also kind of took us down also i cried three times i don't know i'm feeling good i'm excited to see my dad so i also am having really bad uh cramps period cramps oh my god i forgot to tell you guys i apparently bled through my tampon all over my all onto my car seat i'll see you when i get home i thought where's the button i'm with chamberlain paintings what's up people so i haven't been to my dad's house in a really long time and it's kind of a vibe i i don't

a long time so i really forgot how dope it is also he has a drum set in my room so let's see if i can still play drums [Applause] anyways i'm done i'm gonna practice and then in the next video i'm

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-11-15T17:58:47Z,246204,6394647,11153,hi [Music] i am so excited for today's video you already know what i'm doing because you read the title but today i am going to be finding the best fast food french fries yeah that's it on my channel i do a little series where i go to all the fast food restaurants that we know and love i taste the same thing from every single fast food place and then i determine the best so that next time you're out and about and you're maybe like having a little craving for a french fry you know where to go honestly this is just an excuse for me to literally get seven different types of french fries that's really what this all is first stop is going to be mcdonald's we're starting out strong i didn't want to mess around i was like i don't know this is just the classic funny fun fact when i was younger i used to eat primarily just french fries when i would go to a fast food restaurant because i grew up vegetarian so i couldn't get like chicken nuggets i was just getting fries and that was kind of my main food group as a child i haven't eaten fast food french fries in a really long time to be completely honest fast food makes me feel really awful which makes me kind of sad to be honest because they're probably one of my favorite foods although i do love tater tots more if there's an option between tater tots and fries i'm choosing the tater tots i love we should no one episode of this we're doing the [ __ ] tater tot taste test the problem is there's not a lot of places that sell tater tots that are drive through the whole point of this is that i like doing the drive-through you know another thing i've never had a mcdonald's co sprite wait what is it mcdonald's sprite is something like there's like a whole meme about it where it's like mcdonald's sprite is like next level for some reason i would try that today but i hate soda the other thing that's going on is that you can't see how dirty my car is and i love that we're gonna go to mcdonald's wendy's for burger king in and out jack in the box arby's don't ask me why we're going to arby's i just had like something came over me i think growing up my favorite was burger king so we'll see if that reigns true i feel like i never really was like the biggest fan of mcdonald's fries so i don't know if like i don't know i don't know what to expect yeah it's gonna be crazy and fun oh my god there's such a [ __ ] long line can you guys go home this [ __ ] mcdonald's line is just next level i've been waiting in it for 20 minutes for one [ __ ] french fry so these better be the winner honestly hi um can i say this medium fries and that's it i love you oh my god i love you too that was sweet and i loved that i ordered a medium fries because i was like i just ordered one small fries like that's just the weirdest [ __ ] order ever it's like what's the point of that order and i was embarrassed see i need to stop thinking like that like nobody's really judging me i'm just judging myself thank you so much thank you so much all right here we go the way that i've just been at mcdonald's for an hour number one mcdonald's french fries smell is incredible we're going in you know what they're better than i remembered they're very good unfortunately i wanted to hate them almost and go against the grain of society but they're pretty [ __ ] great the salt level pretty flawless the crispiness is there my only complaint is that i do feel like they could be a little bit thicker they're very thin and short that kind of lacks personality for me but also what do you expect they're like two dollars so they have a nice coating of like crispiness on the outside i mean i'd give these easily an eight out of ten um i also think that the packaging is just so iconic classic just childhood in a nutshell next we're going to wendy's let's get into it actually you know what before we go to wendy's i'm going to need to put on more deodorant because i feel like eating all these french fries are going to make my sweat smell like battery acid and that brings us to our sponsor of today's video native deodorant first let me apply a little bit excuse me oh [ __ ] am i in somebody's way sorry what the [ __ ] before we get into the sponsor of today's video i just got kicked out of my parking spot i've been using native products for about a month now they're paraben free aluminum free and then they just came out with their plastic free line which i've been using lavender rose cucumber mint the one i've been using is coconut vanilla these are made from 0 plastic it's made from 100 paper board sourced from responsibly managed forests which is a great thing they've been working on their plastic free packaging for so long two years it's finally out i'm obsessed with it native is also a member of one percent for the planet so that means that they donate one percent of the plastic free deodorant profits to environmental nonprofits which is just another plus i love all of the scents all of them are super great they last a really long time they don't go on sticky they just go on nice and smooth it has coconut oil shea butter in it ever you just went all around with this deodorant and it just smells so good like i eat compliments on how i smell when i wear this and there's free shipping to the us so three plastic free deodorants are normally 39 but if you use my link in the description and use my code emma chamberlain you will get them for 29 and that's 25 off so go do it link in my description thank you native for sponsoring this video i love you guys back to the video now where we will eat french fries and enjoy our time bye the traffic in la today is awful which is just awful luck on my end here i'm riding the wave i'm also a little bit nervous because i didn't bring an extra camera battery and i'm like what if the camera dies yes i could go home and like grab a new one but it's also like why didn't i prepare better it's crazy how badly i prepare for videos considering how long i've been a youtuber it's mind-boggling i don't know if i've definitely told the story about this wendy's like seven times but this is the wendy's where a woman spit in my face at the drive-through window and i rolled down the window so yes i am traumatized by this spot you know what's great about it is that there's never a line at this wendy's oh no my fries spilled i'm gonna invite my two friends over later and be like do you guys want to have a fry party and then we can like just eat fries all together that'd be cute right oh no shut up i'm a hypocrite i i get road rage at other people and then when they get road rage at me i'm like oh [ __ ] you as if like i wouldn't react the same way if i encountered myself on the road oh my god i'm driving by a chipotle and i wish that chipotle had chipotle wait i have an idea chipotle if you're listening you guys should do french fries and then drizzle your queso over your french fries so you guys do your own form of nacho fries i mean as long as i get a little bit of the money that you guys make from that i'm down why did i do this video today the [ __ ] wendy's line just doing tic-tac-toe hi hi welcome to 20 second i help you can i do a small fries you guys have unsweetened cold brew we only have one sweeter i see yeah oh okay i'll do that so apparently i just got an iced tea i don't know why i did that thank you so much i don't think i've had wendy's fries in probably like uh many years so i remember one time my school did a field trip and then afterwards we all went to wendy's and i did have their fries there and i remember thinking that they were good but i was also eight wendy's these smell better than mcdonald's they oh [ __ ] i feel like i'm gonna like these hold on look they're like thicker wendy's although i am getting a slight plastic smell now that they're out of the bag y'all sorry i'm locking my car doors just because i feel unsafe but wendy's y'all these are a 9 out of 10. why is no one talking about this these are [ __ ] awesome number one the circumference around the fry it's a thicker frog they're also longer a little bit more consistent with the crispiness those are going to be hard to top we're actually going to burger king next which i feel like burger king actually does have really good fries so they might give wendy's a run for their money it's exciting we're going to find out who let me get my license when i'm this unfortunate of a driver i'm actually not that bad i just like to say mean things about myself as a coping mechanism but genuinely i'm not that bad but still like it just took me 45 minutes to turn around in like a parking lot that is very massive broadway people who aren't from california in and out burger the iconic in-n-out burger like their fries are not great they taste like cardboard but then they grew on me as i got older okay when i was younger i was so picky about food i would only eat like a good french fry if it wasn't good i just wouldn't eat it type of thing whereas like now if it's bad for me i will eat all of it i don't know what it is about being an adult but i feel like you just get to a point where like anything sweet or anything like really salty or really oily i just like want to eat the whole thing oh i also got a nice tea from wendy's so this could be i just needed some liquid it's actually fire why are you not going oh there's a sorry i honked at somebody for no reason i talked to somebody when they were waiting for a pedestrian i'm going straight to [ __ ] hell burger king time we're pulling in where's the drive-thru shut the [ __ ] up go time baby hi um can i just have a small fry thank you so much thank you andrei thank you brian number three i don't feel sick yet oh okay here we go i'm not a huge oh i just shoved it at my nose it's the least potatoey in the least like appetizing it kind of smells the most plasticky out of all of them but we won't until we give it a try i like the texture of it i like the width of it i like how it's very soft but still crispy but there's not enough salt and for that i'm giving these a 6 out of 10. the smell was lacking the salt was lacking definitely solid like i would still eat these and enjoy it but like it's a six for me and moving on we're going in and out next oh my god the in and out line is gonna be so bad mark my words it's tummy ache time when the camera was off just now did i just get screamed at by someone but like unfairly oh my god the in the in and out line i'm coming back later i am coming back later i i can't i will maybe go to in and out later that [ __ ] was [ __ ] wrong because i know that those ones are gonna be a two too i know that i'm gonna hate those chick-fil-a though on the other hand i haven't had chick-fil-a fries in a while but i remember i like them and i've never tried chick-fil-a sauce so i'd like to do that today as well so we'll have a fun little chick-fil-a moment watch chick-fil-a be really long too huh because i feel like they might be like a nine and like a nine point is somebody honk literally everybody in la is like [ __ ] on x games mode can everybody relax shut the [ __ ] up i hate everybody i'm so sick of it hi um can i just do a small fries with chick-fil-a sauce this man definitely was judging me for having three other bags of fries in my car at the same time hi yes thank you so much have a good day we're going to arby's next do people actually go to arby's i know i'm not trying to be mean either like i'm genuinely asking chick-fil-a turn chick-fil-a time as we know their fries are like waffle fries which is a fun change oh okay chick-fil-a sauce doesn't smell great or look great it kind of looks like baby throw up like if a baby throw up that's kind of what i'm getting from this but i'm excited to try chick-fil-a sauce tastes like a mixture of every condiment that exists i taste barbecue sauce in it i taste mayonnaise in it which i hate i taste mustard in it and i taste ketchup in it all at once i don't like chick-fil-a sauce whereas the fries on the other hand mm-hmm slight chemical you smell but i feel like all of them and have had that so far chick-fil-a i'm giving a nine out of ten they're so thick and like satisfying you can like fold them and i like to fold them in half and like eat them like this so good it's a perfect level of crispy versus not crispy but i still think that wendy's might be ah these actually might be better than wendy's these are 9.5 i'm starting to feel ill i'm starting to have a tummy ache i have to drive nine minutes to an arby's which hurts why are we going to arby's again whose idea was that who's mine i don't know i just kind of am curious about arby's to be honest if there's a line i'm gonna be shocked wait a minute there is a line no way wait oh [ __ ] oh my god i just [ __ ] up so bad i just caused like seven arguments i am so stressed out everybody's mad at me i'm shocked that arby's has a line this is like completely rocking my world it's safe to say arby's has had the longest line out of everyone i've been in this line for about a half an hour this arby's looks kind of like run down a little bit no do you know i'm not gonna judge don't judge a book by its cover this is supposed to be fast food i've been in this line for 45 minutes who just called me leave me the [ __ ] alone i am i've been in an arby's line for hours and i have to shake i'm walking harvey's mine have you ready hi can i do a small curly fries oh my god here we go rb check why are they not leaving okay here we go thank you they have a sign on their window that says that their food could cause cancer or reproductive harm i am going to try the arby's as we move right barbies let's just try your curly fries you know what i'm actually genuinely sorry for anything that i said mean about arby's i mean their curly fries are pretty pretty spot-on it's a pretty [ __ ] perfect curly fry oh my god do you hear that crunch these are fire the flavor is perfect the level of salt and seasoning perfect the crisp perfect i have no complaints like i literally want to give these a 9.8 out of 10. orbeez you are a 9.8 for me and that is something i like wow we're doing jack in the box next oh jack in the box has no line this is exactly what we needed right now because your girl has got to use the potty asap can i get a small fries in a small curly fries oh my god this is the fastest fast food i've ever experienced in my life thank you literally i did not wait like that was the fastest fast food i've ever experienced that was incredible service that is the definition of fast food to me not to mention they have curly fries and regular fries i also made an executive decision that i don't [ __ ] want to go to in and out burger anymore because they don't deserve my service because not only i already know that their fries taste like cardboard i'm gonna give in and out fries a three and i don't even need to show up actually should i go i'm gonna insert a photo of in and out fries and you guys are gonna see how they look and see why they're ugly first jack-in-the-box fry we have is curly it's way too dry it almost needs to be oilier i'll give the curly fries from uh jack-in-the-box a 6.5 out of 10. now i'll try their regular fries they look exactly like mcdonald's so okay copycat that's already upsetting and concerning it's exactly like a mcdonald's fry the only difference being maybe a little bit saltier a little bit drier i'm gonna give them a four like they're good like i would eat them again but like they're not my favorite and then last but not least we have in and out with a zero because i'm mad at them right now what do we learn today barbies has the best fries they're just great number two was chick-fil-a coming in third we had wendy's i mean it was shocking i didn't expect that to rank that high but they were just a great overall solid french fry number four we have burger king it was fine but like whatever it just did not excite me by any means hey everybody so i made a big big mistake mcdonald's was in fourth place and burger king was in fifth i completely skipped over mcdonald's i think i was just having an overall brain fart at this point because i had to poop so bad i had poop brain you know when you like all you can think about is how you just need to get to a toilet then below that we had carl's jr i kind of understand why the line was short but also that experience was great like i'd almost rather get my food quicker than get like a slightly better food and then in six we had in and out because i didn't even go there okay listen guys i am driving home now i'm gonna go have explosive diarrhea of sorts but i also just wanted to thank native for sponsoring this video well listen it's funny i love the fact that i got a deodorant brand deal because everybody knows me to be so stinky that it's like what about now losers so thank you native for sponsoring this video and proving to the world that i don't smell bad go get yourself some arby's curly fries the biggest plot twist of the day and if you think i'm lying please go get arby's curly fries like i'm literally i know i feel like [ __ ] but i'm still gonna go and sit in my bed and literally just shovel the arby's curly fries down my throat um i'm gonna have to stall you until i get home because i need to give you a forehead kiss but i can't give you a fried kiss while i'm driving i feel so sick do i look kind of sick too it's not good almost home and then i can get forehead kiss and then this video can be finally over thank you guys for hanging out with me all day today i love you guys so much and here's your forehead kiss as i said earlier go get yourself a nice barbie's curly fry i mean look at this [ __ ] oh my god these are so good why is no one talking about this [Music] [Applause] [Music] five

-emma chamberlain",2020-11-08T18:26:16Z,270787,5102467,8141,ah okay i don't know what's going on but i'm having a meltdown today i just was so emotionally unstable today i do think i'm pmsing i think my period's coming any day now it's really late at night i don't know what time it is we'll call it 12 so that i can title this video making a midnight snack check routine i know that my period is coming i.e why i ate an entire dinner and i'm very full but i'm still hungry so it is in fact midnight and i will be making a midnight snack i'm also very excited because i know what i'm gonna make a talk about crunchwrap supreme this is extremely unnecessary because i could just go to taco bell but i don't want to do that i want to make my own at midnight and i want to bond with you guys because i just was really unstable today like today was one of those days where i was just like mad if someone didn't respond to me in time over text math if like i got an iced tea from a coffee shop today there was not enough ice in it mac but we're gonna make a crunch crunchwrap supreme let's get our ingredients out this is kind of like cooking with emma except like not planned pms edition like i'm just so mad today but you know what let's turn it around because nobody wants to see me angry right tortilla vegan queso taco seasoning beans in a bag genius cooked brown rice because we all know that i'm not gonna cook rice with the rice cooker all of my avocados are either rotten or not ripe yet so we're definitely not doing avocados in here wow salsa fun fact about me i don't ever eat a taco bell so i'm slightly unfamiliar with like what goes into a contract supreme oh maybe like a vegan meat okay i have this beyond me see this is why you go to bed this is why you go to bed and you don't get all bald and crazy right because look at me now beyond beef crumbles great i feel like that's enough ingredients to like make a good crunchwrap hold on a minute hold on a minute all of my tortillas are like broken in half like they all are broken they're all broken that's okay um i'm gonna start by cooking this meat and i'm not gonna read the instructions i'm just gonna cook the vegan meat actually i am going to read the instructions easy that's enough okay so let me tell you about like some of my unfortunate events today all of my avocados were just like messed up this morning so my breakfast was kind of unfortunate in addition i'm just overall moody like i'm just pissed off for no reason i have no reason to be upset wow it smells really good oh my god my self-esteem is also really bad my self-esteem gets so bad on my period can you explain that to me i one day am like emma you are amazing beautiful wow look at how you've grown look at how you would look at the woman you would turn into my period hits and i'm like emma you are ugly stupid and dumb dumb i'm going to be warming up these beans i you literally just take the bag and put in the microwave i think you warm it up for what should i just make a burrito like do i really need to no i want to make a crunchwrap i think it'd be fun although literally i mean i don't know how i'm going to do it because my maybe i'll just make like a mini one i feel like that's cooked enough should i try it it's pretty good actually beans are done setting those aside this is way too easy actually wait do i have to warm up the rice too [ __ ] you know what i just realized too i haven't done my skincare routine yet so i'm gonna go upstairs i'm gonna do my skincare routine and then we'll come back down and finish cooking my teeth look so yellow that's a story for another day though this feels good i feel like i needed a little me moment okay face is clean and now i present to you our sponsor of today's video which is bliss thank you bliss for sponsoring this video my face is wet today i'm going to be talking about their bright idea vitamin c serum i've been using this for quite some time you guys know how i feel about their products i love them this brightens skin diminishes the look of dark spots protects your collagen in your skin so that your skin is soft and supple and it's vegan and cruelty free the vitamin c plumps and brightens your skin to just make you look bright after i wash my face i put it on and then i put moisturizer on top i follow this off with some moisturizer and i call it a night or a morning i do this morning at night i've definitely seen all of the benefits of this i feel like my skin does look brighter even though i'm kind of like losing my sun-kissed look because it's becoming winter which is terrifying but since i started using this it's gotten a lot better so look at that taking care of your skin is so important you guys know how i feel about that i'm just enjoying learning more about skincare every single day and i don't know i love this product try it out and thank you bliss for sponsoring this video i'm gonna put on moisturizer and then i'm going to go back to my cooking downstairs which i don't really want to do um that's not true i do i'm hungry i'm like i'm hungry and i'm bored so anyway i love you guys i'll see you downstairs why am i talking to you like i'm not just gonna see you downstairs right now i'm back another thing happened today thrifted a shirt and it's amazing it's like a 90s rascal flats shirt if you don't know what rascal flats are you need to just slip that up great purchase great shirt but the perfume on this shirt because i thrifted it is so [ __ ] awful and i don't know what to do but it smells so bad but it smells exactly like the person that would have owned that shirt and bought it new it was like a perfect match it was pretty crazy um how do i warm this up okay let's figure out what to do with this cheese situations vegan cheese let's try it i have a feeling that i'm not gonna like this when it's done and then we're gonna have to make another snack so this might be even more fun because we might have like a double recipe video today not to mention i've only been filming for 20 minutes that's concerning as well this should have taken me a lot longer okay i'm also gonna put this taco seasoning in the rice because i feel like the rice has no seasoning on it so it needs something i like hate being hormonal sorry is that tmi i don't know i don't have like a crazy emotional roller coaster every period but like some periods it does happen and i'm just having one of them and it's just shitty you know it sucks anyway i just put taco seasoning on rice is this gonna be good no so let's assemble oh my god i'm gonna start out with the cheese then rice the meat wait i think i'm putting too much filling beans i guess that's it bean i wish that i could put avocado in it but as we know that's not an option yeah this is like not gonna work huh oh my god it's just breaking as i'm trying to fold it you know what it's more about the flavor no oh [ __ ] this is bad what happened do i need to eat this with a fork and a knife that completely defeats the whole purpose of making a crunchwrap who the [ __ ] is going to like let me hold their kid for nine months if i literally can't make it okay actually it's shockingly nicely seasoned i'm not mad about it but i also feel like i need to make another snack because like this is not enough why do i like it randomly like why am i enjoying it for some reason let's make something else but i need to brainstorm what i want to do next give me like five minutes to just think about who i am i've had some time to reflect on just my overall demeanor and personality this video i know that it's not what we signed up for but as someone once said if you can't handle me at my worst then you do not deserve me at my best so i realized that i've not eaten a vegetable yet today you know what that means i don't actually know what it means yet by the way did someone say mini cauliflower crust pizzas honestly if i had the ingredients to bake a cake and i wasn't too scared to go to the store by myself like we'd be baking a cake right now but instead this is what we're getting yeah what is it about being on my period that just makes me feel so bad about myself i just think of myself now as a literal like just disgusting human being why is that and then the second my period ends i'm like i'm also getting my counter can you guys stop i i'm raising my voice i normally don't raise my voice a lot so i put on some tomato sauce now we're adding the pesto pesto is like literally the best food on this planet these are like little lunchables lunch ideas for your kids you can't say i don't teach you anything okay this is a new vegan mozzarella that i haven't tried did you guys just see ew why did i just lick it i'm licking [ __ ] when i okay do you want let's add a little bit of olives yes i'm using my fingers yes nobody else eats here but me because i have an ego issue with cooking for others i literally cannot cook for other people because i'm worried about them not liking it and then it hurting my ego that's a serious issue that's the toaster i also have an idea i was thinking what if i make myself a cup of tea i know a little bit off-brand this is perfect 90 19. the thing is i love iced tea but hot tea is just like not my vibe but maybe i could like figure out a way to put this over ice i do i feel like i'm getting into tea but see here's what happened like look what happened today i ordered an iced tea and i just never drank it okay i have a fun idea what if we do a time lapse of me cleaning my kitchen three two one is this fun [Music] okay that's good enough for now i'm literally so impatient that i just took that off of the kettle before it was ready i feel so bad for anybody who's gonna have to see me for the next like two days until this goes away am i unpleasant only to myself or am i being unpleasant to others as well they don't teach you the stuff in school you know i feel like i did tire myself out though i mean i just cooked like two full meals not really well okay i guess you could say i cooked a meal i'd like to think that i like made a crunchwrap supreme that was edible and you know i know that my pizzas are gonna be edible because i make these like once a day kind of fool proof is it foolproof f-u-l-l or fool proof f-o-o-l i guess fool proof would make more sense but here's what happens when i make tea hot tea i make the hot tea and then i put it next to my bed and wait for it to cool down and i'm like oh i'll drink it as i'm like going on my phone before bed lo and behold what happens wake up in the morning with a full cup of cold tea i'll see you guys when the pizzas get out yay okay not gonna lie these kind of look delicious many little pizzas i did not eat one vegetable today i try to eat a vegetable every day like i try to at least have one meal that has a lot of veggies because i feel like it's good for my skin and it's just good for anyway it didn't happen today am i going to eat the pizzas right off of the tinfoil yes yes i am also i put nutritional yeast on top it's a great parmesan alternative although i'm so all over the map when it comes to like it's like sometimes i'll i i'll make a cheese board but then like i try not to eat cheese i don't even know who i am we were due for a train wreck video on my instagram you'd probably think that things were going pretty well no i'm a complete angry mess oh that does taste good though maybe because i know how to make it because i make it every night i'm gonna eat this but i don't want to eat it on camera because i don't want you guys have to see that thank you guys for hanging out with me during my midnight snack mental breakdown it means a lot to me that i get to share these moments with you guys and that you will you know sit through it if you did if you did sit through it you're very special some days you're just gonna be angry at the world and sometimes it's because your uterus is about to spit out an egg or whatever it does on your period so i'm excited for the time when i'm older and i'm going through menopause and my period's going away and i can look back at this moment and be like wow remember when you had your period wasn't so bad after all i love you guys so much here's your forehead kiss but i can't get let me get in there i love you guys so much thank you for hanging out with me next time you're making a snack at midnight and you feel like your life is crumbling just know that everybody does this cheers and good night i'm gonna be on tick tock until four in the morning tonight i just feel it okay bye i love you guys why are you i literally don't understand how you guys have stuck with me for this many years and you're not sick of this [ __ ] chaos how are you not sick of it yet you have to be i know there's a lot of you that are but some of you guys are still hanging out with me and it blows my mind and i love you later

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-10-25T17:53:28Z,276837,6813774,10866,good morning hi kitties [Music] we're vlogging today i haven't done anything except making myself a cold brew so right now i'm feeding the cats step one of the day my cats actually get smart water because my mom says that it's good to give them bottled water so i'm gonna give them a little bit of water just a little bit though because they don't need a lot you guys can be thirsty it's okay i'm just kidding that is not something to joke about my favorite part of the day is when i get to look eye to eye with this we're gonna make breakfast cause recently i've been on my breakfast [ __ ] okay so here's the thing i have one avocado left and if this avocado is rotten i'm gonna be super upset because i don't like to eat my breakfast without avocado oh thank god best day ever i'm trying to also cut my avocado like chefs do you know they go like this they're like but when i do it it's just like not as good i woke up this morning with a headache i don't know what's up with that nothing a little coffee can't fix i didn't [ __ ] around with the cold brew this morning recently i've been making these really good breakfast burrito breakfast tacos yes i'm a cooking channel yes i do they're cooking oh wait i can't [ __ ] that see like it's just such a bummer that i just can't sing i can't like fully be myself because there's always a risk of being copyrighted in everything that i do we have some spicy habanero salsa we have vegetarian sausage we have some vegan colby jack shreds we have two eggs we have almond flour tortilla and let's get right on into it funny story well actually not that funny i'm literally having a barbecue on friday which is tomorrow with what three or four people because pandemic and also because i they're the only people like we only see each other i'm throwing a barbecue listen the word throwing should be taken lightly there will be literally three to four people including me i decided to throw like an entire barbecue mini barbecue just so that i'd have an excuse to make a cheese board so today we definitely need to go to the store and figure out what's going on this cheese board i just don't know where to get the ingredients like i'm kind of feeling like trader joe's might be the vibe if you want to know what i'm doing right now i'm taking half of these vegan sausage link cutting it up and i'm starting to sizzle it in some olive oil all right while this is cooking i'm actually going to see what ingredients i have for this cheese board already because i feel like i already have stuff from the last time i made a cheese board so like i can like kind of narrow down what i need okay do have apricots so this is good cashews let's see if these are so good yeah oh my god i still have honeycomb fun okay okay i still have these mac crackers in these bread sticks which i feel like these are definitely rotten they're a little bit stale and i burn my sausage you know what it's okay though it'll still taste good crack the egg in okay then you like mix it up season with salt and pepper add a little bit more oil put your tortilla in the toaster oven is that a good idea i don't know but i do that now i'm gonna assemble my breakfast taco taking my tortilla out and they put that in there avocado put that on it i'm going to take some of the salsa you can't even see it huh put that up god that looks [ __ ] good the vegan cheese ruins the aesthetic of it because it looks so [ __ ] sad it's just like doesn't look like real cheese and then i put this chili lime seasoning blend from trader joe's on it and check this out [Applause] it's so good you want to know you want to know how you can tell that i'm having a slightly rough day this is my coffee cup of the day this thing is the size of my head um to be completely honest with you for the next hour while i finish my coffee i'm going to be making a mood board for my cheese board tomorrow literally i cannot think of a time in my life where i've ever like put effort into something like this but i'm genuinely excited about it and i'm just gonna run with it because i don't genuinely get excited about things very often but i'm genuinely excited to make this [ __ ] cheese board for my two friends that probably won't even eat it but i don't care because it's not about that it's about the fact that i want to make it and i'm gonna lay in bed for the next hour and [ __ ] make a mood board for it okay because i'm excited about it and that is okay see i like [Music] um i'm like a novice cheese board maker oh should i get grapes see but the thing is about cheese boards is that nobody actually eats what's on it like people eat literally one third of what's on it i'm gonna keep looking grocery shopping is gonna be fun but i just got a very exciting package from the sponsor of today's video which is thredup thank you thread up for sponsoring this video thredup is the largest online thrift store and they have literally everything you can imagine all of your favorite stores like they have urban outfitters levi's louis vuitton gap this is actually from thredup not only that but i literally got this for 14.99 and the estimated retail price of it was 50 so that's a pretty good deal if you ask me you can get things for literally 90 off the estimated retail on thredup it's incredible and thrifting is sustainable it's a win-win anyway i'm gonna get into my haul of what i got from them because i got some really good stuff and i'm very excited and i want to show you oh i have to try all this on hold on first thing i got was this it's from city silk and it was estimated to be 10.99 i got it for 9.99 next i got this very cute fitted polo from ralph lauren and i paid 17.99 for this and guess what the estimated retail price would have been 89 that's an 83 decrease in price i also got these cowboy boots i've been wanting cowboy boots for so long and i literally found the perfect red pair they're from the brand old gringo like are you kidding i mean okay don't look at this outfit like this is not how i would style it i would style this with jeans and like a sweater i got these for 169 and they were originally 450 estimated retail value i also got this super cute gap button up um my cats are having a lot of fun with the wrapping paper so that's a good perk i paid 11.99 for this on thredup but the estimated retail price was 13.99 and the last thing i got was this very cute ralph lauren sweater that i paid 42.99 for on threda and the estimated retail price of this was 179 a discount anyway um if you want to shop on thredup you can use my code emma for 30 off your first purchase if you use the link in my description and use the code ammo which is my name thank you thread up for sponsoring this video i love you guys a lot and i love what you're doing and i love thrifting and so you know that i love you guys okay i'm gonna get dressed to go to the store i mean we're only going to trader joe's trader joe's carrie i'm gonna get see i'm gonna get [ __ ] copyrighted um anyway i'm wearing sweatpants right now but i think we're gonna do a little denim short moment i'm gonna wear this hoodie though because i'm not i don't want to take it off you know when sometimes you like wake up in your pjs and you're like i'm just gonna keep wearing the pjs i also need oh my god i know what else we need to do today okay so we're preparing for cheese board we also need to pick out my halloween costume because i have no idea what i'm gonna be for halloween i will just be inside the whole time for obvious reasons but i still wanna have a costume so that i can take an instagram photo and post it i think i wanna use the cowboy boots that i just got because i feel like those would be cute for like a costume but then also for like day-to-day life with jeans but i do kind of want to make a costume out of them so we'll pick that out later all right and i don't want to buy anything i refuse to buy anything because i'm trying to be thoughtful with my money this is so big that i can't fit it in my i can't oh i made a mess also my car key broke today's just one of those days you know what i mean i'm also kind of mortified that i'm like dedicating my entire day to preparing for this [ __ ] cheese board there's also not a lot of things to do like i went to go run errands the other day and everything that i went to was closed like i went to this like i like glass store so that i could get new reading glasses because my i have astigmatism i don't even know what that means alas the store was closed and then i went to go get my nails done and then the nail salon was closed too and i was like guys why are we closed even though it said it was open online but i also feel like i'm i'm at a phase in my life right now where like i'm aging up and like i'm starting to enjoy the finer things in life like a cheese board so i am growing up which is cool like i also enjoy the flavor of like a very rich aged cheese but i've always been that way like i've always liked a nice aged cheddar there's a lot to be said for the type of cheese that people like and like how that relates to their personality you know that somebody is smart and artistic when they're choosing the aged cheddar or the smoked gouda free like a soft brie or like any kind of soft cheese is somebody who just says yes to everything i'm offending my friend olivia right now but she also she does say yes to everything but she loves the brie and she's just like so like chill and easy going she'll just do anything and then there's the people that like use the the [ __ ] fruit preserve on the cheese board people who use that when they're making like a little cheese and cracker they think that they are the smartest person on this planet and definitely the smartest person in the room they like will use one big word that they literally saw on like their instagram explorer page they're so obsessed with being different and they're the type of person that like thinks everything is an aesthetic it's like shut up i don't think i've ever been more excited to do a haul than i am right now like mini cheese board haul oh my god there's no line oh this is awesome oh my god and the parking is free today isn't so bad after all so we're gonna go in um mental list your mental list i'm thinking grapes more cheese and crackers obviously rosemary we'll see wish me luck y'all want a cheese haul come on admit it so i got these this is like a [ __ ] cop out some people don't like a good hearty cheese some people like the pre-sliced [ __ ] and like this one looked fine so i got it i got grapes in all different colors listen i just want to post it on my instagram that's why i'm making it good i think it's really deep down why i'm excited it has nothing to do with like you know doing something nice for my friends or anything it's pretty much all about me i got rosemary because that's just like a beautiful beautiful decoration these parmesan crisps because these look very elegant cheese sticks that are twisty because they're all so pretty but also i know that people love to eat these we have a brie for my friend olivia she said that if i didn't get brie for her she would call the police i also got a dutch gouda this soft cheese my personal favorite cheese which is the irish dubliner cheese i used to eat this on everything as a kid and it just is really good cheese has a lot of protein and then i got this assorted crackers because you just can't go wrong with this and then last but not least i did also get some everything about the bagel seasoning this is unrelated this is just something that every time i go i have to buy it i do need to get the stuff in the fridge because if it all goes bad then what's the point of all of it if i like serve a cheese platter tomorrow and all the cheese is like rotten does that even happen though because she's like i don't think she's rots because it's like mold itself i just spent the last hour and a half trying to figure out what i was gonna be for halloween i just got a bunch of new clothes so like i don't need to go out and get anything so here's my i made a presentation for you guys of my ideas number one a 1960s runway model i am much too short to be an actual model but i love the style of 1960s runways next 1960s through 80s tennis player i was a tennis player in high school but i think i could do it better now next um wild west traditional cowgirl and then last but not least the makeup that's the kicker so like a zombie version of any of those things so we need to start picking out these outfits i'm gonna try on all of these things and then like we'll decide which one fits the best for me the first outfit is the 60s runway model easily this piece which i talked about earlier from thredup this is just perfect for that then we need a skirt i feel like of some sort maybe right and then maybe we do like a headband like a plain white headband and as for shoes maybe this okay wait what if i did this dress with these boots i don't even know if this is the right era the green jacket over top and then the white headband that could be kind of cool next we need to pick out the tennis player i know i'm gonna like this one the best tennis skirt whatever white collared shirt i have that right here done easy hold on hold your horses this would be so perfect where is it oh no oh my god i found it are you kidding me one of these tied around my neck from thredup oh look at these and then like these sort of tennessee kind of shoes and then last but not least wild wild west cowgirl this is incredible look at that buckley thing and then the sides have that that's perfect i'll take a bandana and tie this around my neck or something or maybe maybe around my well i like neck and then the cowboy boots of course so that completes that one all right let's try them on [Music] i like it but i don't know like i feel like it is cute but i feel like i need a cowboy hat and i don't have one i don't think i'm gonna do this one oh wait i forgot the headband this one is very cute and is definitely a contender is this even halloween but at the same time like the makeup will take it up a notch i like this one better than the first one so this one definitely might end up being the one [Music] this is what i'm talking about i like it i [ __ ] with it and i think it's actually a good outfit too like this jacket is [ __ ] amazing i'm so obsessed with it i can't believe that this was ten dollars i'm obsessed i'm [ __ ] obsessed with this okay i did not expect this to go so well let's see if we can turn me into a zombie real quick because my idea is now that i'm thinking about it it's like i wear these glasses and i look normal and then i take them off and i have zombie eyes cool maybe i do like halloween thank you james using your palette no sponsor earlier that's just just me being a homie because james i know you're probably you probably need me to shout out your palette so bad so i'm not gonna look at any photos i'm just gonna wing it let's start out with like this reddish that around my eyes oh that's really good that's a good base of like not looking so good eyes like definitely look like i got punched in the face which is a good start let's really chisel my my cheekbones with like a dark color maybe we use like purple and brown cool wait maybe see i think i might actually be better at costume makeup than like actual makeup because you don't have to be as like particular about it because it's literally not like a real it's not like a real you're not actually you know what i'm saying so i think we need to add some purple to the eyes purple in my crease i'm having fun actually this looks [ __ ] fire it's kind of good why is it good okay i'm gonna take some red now yeah like around the edge let me what if i added red like oh like added some red like around my mouth oh cool i don't know what i'm doing let's add some more brown i feel like we need more brown that was maybe too much sometimes when it's not broken you don't fix it you know what i mean oh no that's kind of cool okay i think i'm done no i need lip i need a lip product like a dark matte lip or what if i do like a bright red lip no i'll do a dark red lip i mean dark nude oh i hate that color and that just did kind of ruin the whole thing zombie runway model check have you ever seen somebody [ __ ] do this a 1960s runway model zombie you all have never seen anything like this [Music] ew i don't think i did actually a good job now that i'm looking at it in the light now i'm gonna go to lay in bed for a few hours bye hi it's the next day you're probably wondering i mean you just disappeared yesterday well i found my old cheer uniform and for the remainder of yesterday i wore it around the house but it's a new day so let's today's the day of my barbecue i just popped a blackhead on my forehead my barbecue is today and i wasn't gonna film me making this cheese board but then i realized that i literally all i talked about yesterday was me making this cheese board so i feel like it would be weird if i just like left it at back everybody make sure to wash your hands all the time here's the board but it is a little bit dirty oh [ __ ] i just sprayed water on everything oh i am wearing pants by the way just i just worked out so i'm wearing shorts this is what i like to do like most people like like some people like the cooking element like my friend olivia is gonna be cooking and grilling because that's what she likes i don't like that stuff we have all the cheese i'm gonna rinse the grapes also yes i am wearing the same sweatshirt as yesterday because i wear the same sweatshirt for multiple days in a row with no shame i'm gonna lay out all the cheese and then i'll lay everything else out on a round first i feel like we need to lay out the brie because this is the one that my friend olivia is most excited about i feel like this should be kind of the centerpiece well actually i'm gonna put the bree leg right here okay gouda honestly i think the reason why i like gouda is literally because it has this red detail on it always and i just think that that's so pretty oh [ __ ] that's good huh put that like right here everybody likes this cheese for some reason it's always like a big hit oh my god it smells so good oh it's also so nice because it just like comes like that put that one like right here this is a dubliner it's a nice irish cheese and i'm irish so this one can go like right here i'm gonna be sitting by the [ __ ] cheese board the whole day watching to see who chooses this selection and judging them ew why does it smell bad smells like when declan burps for some reason this is the people who don't give a [ __ ] about cheese area what if i make this whole cheese board and no one touches it okay we're gonna start out with our crackers these are my favorite ones these are like the whole wheat ones but they're so good okay cute they're all [ __ ] broken who did that okay that's good oh my god they're all broken which is so not aesthetically pleasing which is the whole point maybe i'll like make a little bowl of crackers is that extra i'm gonna make a bowl of extra crackers and that's where these will go because they taste really good but they're like all broken and not pretty and i can't have that in my board god this is really coming together huh yeah this is this shit's starting to look good huh [ __ ] yeah i also have this party assortment tray cute okay now it's time to make it pretty right i think we had some grapes okay we're going to be like strategic with this you know what i mean i'm putting i'm almost embarrassed that the level of effort i'm putting in for like how many people are truly going to be at my home it's like not a lot so i got these cheese sticks wait this is starting to look really good oh i have oh where is it i thought i had fruit preserves but i actually don't okay look how [ __ ] cute these are hello stop oh my god it looks great but it's like missing some color i'm gonna add honeycomb even though like again nobody's gonna eat that it's more just for decoration see look it's like put that right here that looks beautiful oh my god oh now i need to [ __ ] wash my hands again because it's my finger okay more honeycomb it's [ __ ] messy put it like over here okay no i just like that okay let's do some great how do we feel about that let me feel in here oh cute i also have parmesan crisps oh yeah that was a good choice that was a really good choice that looks very good now i feel like it's time to add some like fillers it adds to the [ __ ] wait are these even good still i feel like these might be rotten i guess dried fruit doesn't really go bad i wonder if like everybody could be good at this though like am i like special or anything okay now i need to add the rosemary and then i feel like i'm done finishing touches oh i killed this [ __ ] yes yes i don't know what to do with it though because now they're not coming over for another like hour [Applause] wow i love it i

-emma chamberlain",2020-10-18T17:01:16Z,237089,3267736,5089,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what time of the day do you think it is morning or night it's morning and i look terrible [Music] okay so it's 6am you're probably like emma what the [ __ ] are you doing normally right now if we weren't in a pandemic i would be at paris fashion week with louis vuitton but unfortunately right now i can't go to paris they still sent me an invite they sent me a virtual seat invite so we're gonna watch the show together and have a little paris fashion week day even though it can't actually be there so i don't know how this virtual seat works okay i think is it like this link wow can they hear me i hope not okay so it starts in one minute but can they hear me there's literally people like can they hear me like i don't know anyway the show starts in 50 seconds let's just watch the show and then we can discuss more things after because i have this weird feeling that they can hear me and i don't want to be rude and some people keep looking at me but i'm like a stick with a phone on it so i don't know how people are looking at me okay so i have a feeling that this is not going to start for a second if you want to come sit in my bed with me we can talk so basically what i didn't realize was that i literally have a seat at the show still i am connected to a phone this is bizarre i'm also in a very bad mood because i didn't sleep like one minute last night because i had the worst period cramps in my life last night when i tell you the worst like the worst i really hope that my i'm not connected to some sort of like i hope it's not like a webcam situation because then they could see me in my bed and that would be really embarrassing i still want to like feel like this a fun fashion weekday so we're gonna watch the show talk about it as we normally do um except for that this time it's at six a.m my time and i'm in full pajamas then louis vuitton sent me some clothes so we're gonna explore that situation maybe do a little try on maybe take an instagram photo probably not though because i'm on my period and i just feel like [ __ ] i think it's starting [Music] god these looks are so good [Music] sorry i'm very sucked in i love [Music] oh oh the sun's going on here we go the big finale i feel like i'm there right now it's weird wow what a beautiful morning all right what an experience that was actually kind of crazy so let's head downstairs for our morning coffee to discuss oh my god it's so dark it's so dark i'm never up this early like i've been waking up early recently but like this is a new level so my house is a [ __ ] mess good morning let's talk about that experience because that was bizarre i didn't realize that i actually had a literal seat in between each guest that's there physically there was a tripod with a phone on it with a virtual guest on it so like there were actual virtual guests there like i wasn't just watching a live stream i literally had my own seat and that doesn't make any sense to me but i felt special no better way to start my paris morning than with a coffee right you know being at home and being able to just like be in my pjs and [ __ ] but still enjoy the show and have a seat wasn't the worst thing ever i did have a little bit of fomo because i was like okay like i wish i was there and i could be in a cute outfit and [ __ ] but they did send me some clothes so it's not like i can't play dress-up today if i don't want but it is 7 a.m so i am feeling like i need a few hours so i'm making myself like a nice parisian breakfast this morning whatever but why am i using like my normal no watch this i'm gonna use like a nice glass something that they would use my favorite thing about being in paris is staying at this certain hotel in eating this certain stupid breakfast okay it's not stupid at all literally best breakfast on this planet and i'm gonna make the same thing at home and it's not gonna be remotely as good but i will try my home right now is a complete mess i have [ __ ] everywhere all right so coffee is done we're gonna set this aside and start getting started and get started on my breakfast granola and i get it with a side of almond milk so let's make the experience similar you know what i mean see i'm gonna put some almond milk in here you know what i mean so that i can like pour it over the top and it feels like i'm in a restaurant or something last but not least i make eggs today i'm gonna try to like genuinely make a good over hard egg we'll see how it goes this pan is [ __ ] disgusting and burnt but i will use it oh my god look what else i got louis vuitton sent these uh macaroons to my house so i could add this to my breakfast spread i did just have a period cramp shoot down my leg everyone hates on me because i burn my eggs i love it this actually is very similar to my [ __ ] paris breakfast check this out let's do a taste test and compare it first we have the granola i mean that granola is really good i'm not mad about it at all i love it the one in paris nothing can touch it but that is still actually really good next is cherry macaroon i like that coffee is fire last but not least is try the egg normally they give me tapatio hot sauce to put on it when i'm in paris so it's so random but the hotel i stay in always has many little ones ones of these i did a good job i'm gonna go lay in bed for like an hour and i'll see you guys later when i have motivation to do something it is still the morning it's 7 a.m so here's kind of my plan right louis vuitton sent me a lot of clothes and you know me conceited narcissistic instagram obsessed [ __ ] i don't have anyone to take a photo of me but i'm going to get creative and try to take one but i do want to like get into an outfit do like a full glam maybe do a little hair like have fun with it so for starters we're gonna do a haul oh my god these i actually bought so ignore oh i am obsessed with these so ignore this because this these are not a part of this haul because i actually bought these like so this is not something that is they just like are letting me borrow here's the first outfit we have these pants that are not gonna fit me because they look a little bit big this turtleneck which i really like and these pants which i love okay next they sent me this massive coat um it is like gonna be 90 degrees today so maybe we'll pass but this is amazing like i want to wear this skiing even though i hate skiing and i hate snow sports what's in here cute navy blue skirt i like that oh my god cool body suit i really like this i'm going to put that aside ooh they sent me this that's kind of incredible they also said this which i have did i wear this i think i wore this for something what is this oh the mini oh i need to wear that they [ __ ] sent no way these corduroy god this is like so me i have to wear that how my period cramps are so bad look at that though okay that's an option too and then last but not least this oh this is so cute this like navy but i think that i've already i have too many favorites so i think we're gonna need to narrow it down from here we're gonna do a try on outfit number one this is very cute but it's definitely a little bit long for me i really really like this a lot this is definitely an option i really like it i don't know why it just looks dope okay this bodysuit is very good although i didn't zip it all the way in the back because i got lazy i really love this but the problem is i just tried on the pants and they didn't really fit quite over my booty region shockingly because i have a tiny non-existent okay i have one more outfit left so let's check it out i feel like this i saved this outfit for last because i think this one's gonna be my favorite and if it isn't i'm gonna call the police so hold on i was right this one is definitely my favorite these pants are you kidding me oh yeah this is the fit so now that we have the outfits it's time to get ready i kind of like the fact that my face right now looks very natural and that my hair looks kind of loose so i kind of feel like i'm gonna do more of a natural look like i like the kind of like rough around the edges look that i have going right now um i'm not going to take this outfit off though i'm just going to put a robe over it let's get ready the way that i'm becoming a beauty guru how did i just do my makeup in two videos in a row like that's unbelievable to me but anyway the way that i might have to call my friend to come over and take my photo i hope she doesn't mind i've like tried looks at fashion shows before and did not work um like one time we tried to do like a slick back hairdo for me it looked terrible sometimes things just don't work for your face and head i'm really wanting to do something very natural and dewy today i almost like my under eye bags right now but i'm gonna cover them anyway i'm having a really rough period this month i'm getting my damn ass [Music] kicked the thing i like most about going to paris for fashion week is that i like get a reset like i feel like it's a reset and it inspires me clothing-wise it inspires me life-wise because it's just nice to get out of my normal element and like there's something really refreshing about it and i think it's been hard for me this year not traveling as [ __ ] annoying as that sounds like being like oh no traveling i know that's [ __ ] annoying it's been hard for me because that's like my time to reset and i haven't had that and so it's been a bummer i usually don't use brow gel i normally use carmex for my eyebrows in my last video where i used carmex on my eyebrows everybody was roasting me so i am using brow gel today but it doesn't work as well since i started my channel one of my favorite things that i've been able to do you know opportunity wise is is go to these shows like it's truly one of my favorite things that i get to do i'm gonna try this product out i don't really know anything about it but that looks kind of pretty but i do need to put a different color in my crease now see i'm like learning about like what you need to do with makeup in order for it to make sense like i'm still i mean listen i'm not there yet but why am i getting good at makeup what help who let me get good at makeup this is this should be a crime i kind of want to put on like a bold lip oh this is a good color okay now i cover it with my lip gloss i don't know why this lip gloss just like makes my lips go from like ugly to like very good oh [ __ ] oh should i do like some big gold hoops is that good i like that mascara and then i'm done i'm getting better at makeup guys i'm growing up i'm evolving oh [ __ ] part of me is kind of glad that i'm at home right now dealing with this excruciating abdominal pain instead of doing that while trying to enjoy myself and watching a show that would be pretty miserable done i don't even want to do anything to my hair i kind of like how it's like just like this rough messy ponytail i kind of [ __ ] with that it's very me it's very like this is i like woke up like this you know what i mean [Music] qv you're the paparazzi i'm gonna pose for you i'm obsessed with this outfit it is so good what if i forced you to come to my home and take a photo of me because louis vuitton sent me an outfit i went a little bit overboard and now it's 8 30 in the morning and you know i have a good outfit on would you punch me you can get a macaroon for free i have macaroons if you want a macaroon you can get a macaroon as a gift okay we'll see what happens olivia is coming over to take my photo all she wants is coffee as a gift this is too easy see this is why it's good to have good friends in your life that will take an instagram photo for you even when it's inconvenient for that olivia's an oat milk gal so i'm gonna go get her oat milk for this maybe we should give her some macaroons too i'm gonna make her a baggie of them so here's her gift olivia's gift is ready and uh now she's gonna take my photos so thank you olivia for coming over at 8 30 in the morning to take my instagram photo insert the pics that we take right now thank you louis vuitton for virtually sending me to your show i wish i could have been there in person i can't wait until i can go back to paris

-emma chamberlain",2020-10-11T17:08:34Z,271170,5268193,10981,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] howdy y'all god i'm just embarrassing myself no not my halloween bowl i never celebrate the holidays but halloween is coming okay uh as i was trying to say i never celebrate the holidays but halloween is coming so i decided to make a little uh reese's peanut butter cup bowl for all of my guests that don't come over it's safe to say that i'm kind of running out of ideas to do at home not only am i struggling in that area but i'm also struggling in general normally i have like a few things that i do to stimulate my brain when i'm feeling really bored or kind of just like exhausted and i need like a revamp one thing that i do a lot is i get ear piercings okay every time i'm like feeling like i need a reset i'll just get a new year piercing um and half the time they get infected and fall out a few days later i still do that anyway every once in a while i get this crazy feeling in my body that tells me to get a tattoo and my mind immediately says emma don't do that just get a piercing because you can always take it out but for some reason i feel like piercings in tattoos are something that people do when they need like a reset everybody i know is always like emma you don't seem like the tattoo type that's not you and i kind of get it because i kind of agree but at the same time i want to test it out so today i'm going to apply a copious amount of fake tattoos yeah so i'm just going to be putting fake tattoos all over my body and seeing how i look and styling myself a little differently to match the tattoos maybe do like some makeup that matches the tattoos i think the thing about tattoos that scare me i mean you can obviously get them removed but it's like not a very smooth process the thing about tattoos that's always scared me is the fact that like the chance of me regretting it in six months is like very hot like my brain i feel like changes every few months so like me getting a tattoo is very permanent it needs to be something that you're gonna like forever and to be honest i don't think i've ever liked something for more than two months straight okay yeah i have a nose ring but if i want to take that out i just take it out which i never will because i really like it and i want to be like 50 with a nose ring that's my vibe tattoo check and you know it's going to be fun because while we're getting um while we're putting on my tattoos we can talk about our feelings and stuff and it's almost like we're at a tattoo appointment together oh that's terrible angle i don't know how to film okay that's good it's very no that's unflattering angle you guys are about to sit on this little loofah uh or whatever that that's not a loofah i don't know what this is called i have literally been a youtuber right for like three years almost four years now which is crazy i've been a [ __ ] youtuber for that long and yet i still don't have like a valid filming setup okay so i have a bunch of tattoos middle finger banana this one i'm putting on my my i have this a few little mini ones maybe behind my ear or something this one that i thought was pretty this one i love a lot i got like cool ones like this is not like like i want to genuinely see what this looks like i got this cat one which is kind of ugly so i really won't use it this one's super cute and i got this one it seems like they're pretty easy to apply i'm gonna start with the small ones i'm gonna do one on my neck so you're supposed to prime the spot with a wipe for 30 seconds that's enough and maybe i'll start preparing my arm too i like the spot i like arm tattoos that's like totally goals so you're supposed to let the stuff drop god this is going to take a while huh because i'm putting them all over my body all right so first one we're doing this little star can you see it oh no i can't see the spot god i wish i had someone here to help me this is like one of those moments i wish my mom was here i need my mirror brb um tattoo number one is on my neck i feel like this one could be kind of cute right here okay let's do it watch me like do it wrong and this whole thing be a fail i'm definitely worried about that done is that a good spot oh [ __ ] it's like pulling on my ass where should i put the neck see now i'm running out of spots these are like my favorite spots maybe i do one on my ankle no well my dad is not a huge fan of tattoos i don't think and i think that's a big reason why i decided or i like never wanted to do one but i feel like now that i'm an adult it's like what can anyone do right if i want to get a tattoo maybe i will because i'm a big kid so i can kind of do whatever i want i'm gonna do the cat one because i don't really like it that much so if it's on my ankle i'm not really gonna care this area is not shaved properly and they said that that was really important but whatever it's not really on my ankle is it kind of higher but it's fine i'm running out of body space like maybe i put it like right here it's kind of dope i really love this banana one so i'm gonna do this one this is fun tattoo number four that's cute i feel like tattoos makes somebody like so much more badass and i don't know if that's just like a stupid immature way of looking at it like i think i'm gonna do the middle finger like on the back of my shoulder like right here can you guys not be doing things like that that's good wait you can literally see my boobs so i'm really sorry moving on maybe like on my back is that even like at this point i'm just like slapping them anywhere i think i'm gonna stop there before i maybe i put one what if i put one like right here actually last one i'm gonna put i'm just gonna slap it right here i'm not even gonna well i'll cleanse the area last one okay so i have my tattoos literally throughout my body so i'm gonna see you guys tomorrow when my tattoos are fully formed but until then enjoy your day what the [ __ ] okay it's a few hours later the tattoos are done i thought i was gonna have to wait until tomorrow but like they're here i am scared i'm scared let me do a little tattoo reveal okay we have this one we have these two we have these two we have this one if you can see that we have this oh that one we have that one and then the one on my ankle is boring but that one why do i like them why why do i like that like i filmed this because i was like i want to almost talk myself out of getting tattoos i feel like if i put them all over my body i'm gonna hate it but this has now made me want to get a tattoo more so next time i'm having a mental breakdown and i want to get a piercing i might leave with a tattoo as well and i don't like that i like this one i like the ones on my arms and i like this one this one no i like that so we need to have fun with this now i'm kind of tired i need to make another coffee but it's like 6 p.m and i don't think that's a good idea so i'm just gonna drink this old one from earlier actually still tastes good okay first step i'm gonna pick out my outfit second step i'm gonna fix up my makeup third step i'm gonna call my parents and reveal it to them and see what they think outfit first let's go crazy but actually before i pick out my outfit i'm gonna talk about today's sponsor because it's kind of relevant princess paulie princess paulie is a clothing store that i really really like and i have been wearing things from princess paulie for quite a while now this outfit's actually from princess paulie whatever outfit i end up choosing for my new tattoos will also be from princess falcon i thought it would be fun to show you two outfits that i recently got from princess paulie that i'm obsessed with so that you kind of have a gauge as to what they're all about so this outfit is so cute they have a lot of fun little pastel moments going on i'm obsessed i love this skirt and would literally wear it with every outfit if i could so this is one of my princess polly outfit faves um i'll show you one more if you guys are down are you guys down to see another one so here's another really cute one um i'm obsessed with these pants and i literally wear white tops like this every single day this one's amazing and these cute boots i mean princess polly has it all basically like if you're having more of a grungy little moment they have boots like this but also if you're having more of a simple moment and you just want to wear basics and stuff they have stuff like this or if you're in the mood to kind of be a little classy rose on the weekends type of gal which i can't be because i'm 19 but you can wear pants like this all from princess paulie so they have what you need anyway well this is actually a bonus outfit outfit number three from princess paulie if you guys would like a little code to shop at princess paulie code emma my name e-m-m-a my code will give you 20 off they also have free shipping in the u.s over orders of 50 and princess paul uses after pay so it's a win-win-win thank you princess polly for sponsoring this i am now going to use your clothing to pick out an outfit inspired by my tattoos i'm thinking these leather pants a white leather is kind of like a rock star tattoo girl but not over the top vibe so let's maybe do these i also just found this top see i feel like this top is so cute and this has like a nice open back so that's kind of perfect let's try it on we have bad news these two things very cute separately but together they are different shades of white i don't know if this top would like match the vibe this little we'll try it i i may or may not have just spent like 20 minutes picking out an outfit but i i have it so here's what i'm thinking right it's like cute like this but then if i want to show off the tattoos i go like this wait i'm kind of having second thoughts do you guys think i wear this top or this like shiny top that can then be like boom i don't know i don't know what's wrong with me i recently i think that my ability to put effort into anything you know in a healthy way it's just like i give up i've been just giving up a lot um i was thinking we could add some black eyeliner oh i did not do a good job i do need to touch up the rest of my face though because it's a lot worse than i thought the problem i don't know how to touch up my makeup it always ends up just looking cakey but i'm trying today i like doing a dark lip though it makes me it does make me feel like a big kid oh see that helped okay now this is where the eyeliner see i'm not going to set myself up for failure here because i actually want to look good anyway let's try to do like a little wing here a little brown wing that may have worked actually i wish i didn't have anxiety when it came to like being dressed up in front of people but i genuinely like some people are like oh when i am not dressed up i feel weird but for me it's the opposite oh that's dark huh this is what happens when you don't start fresh actually it doesn't look terrible i'm just gonna add a little bit more mascara and call it a day i definitely look old my under eyes are making me look quite exhausted i've actually been seeing people do like i want to try that right now i've been seeing people do like a cute like red underneath their eye i don't know how to explain what i'm talking about like this look under your eyes that i don't know if i have a color i'm just i might just use red actually it's kind of good so i've decided if i don't stop doing my makeup it will get worse i did the little red under my eyes it doesn't look it doesn't look terrible okay outfit hair makeup done i didn't do anything to my hair but well i could do something to my hair you know what this was actually much needed okay pov you see me out and about and i'm like or like even like this one i kind of look cool right before i call my parents we have one more thing that we need to do when you have tattoos it's like a conversation starter i feel like people always are like oh what does that mean what does that mean knowing that i need to have a prepared answer for the next two weeks as to what these mean to me this one this one wait let me get into the voice this one represents to me my creativity and going outside of my brain stepping out reaching me metaphorically out of my head so that i can be creative next i have this banana inspired by my favorite childhood smoothie i used to love peanut butter banana smoothies they're so yummy it also reminds me of the velvet underground album if you know what i'm talking about and if you don't you're probably pretty lame next i have this one which represents death becoming an angel and flying away after you die and that just reminds me that it's really not so scary after all how annoying is this voice i feel really bad but i'm definitely gonna do it to describe every tattoo that i have this is like a canvas with just squiggled lines on it to represent my lack of artistic ability okay i can't do the voice anymore i cannot i cannot do the voice anymore this i want to keep doing it this one represents dance because i was a cheerleader for six years this one is a mouth with a chili that one represents how when i eat spicy food i get acid reflux and i can feel it right here in my chest next i have this star on my neck to remind me that i'm a star can you believe that that voice is me i am mind blown that that is me i got this middle finger because i love going like this a lot we have this glass that's a reminder for me to drink water because i drink a lot of coffee last but not least i have my cat tattooed that one reminds me to feed my cats every day i've probably never made a more annoying voice regardless i'm going to call my parents and show them all right hi look at you okay wait i'm gonna show you my tattoos what like do i look cool or no look yeah why are you laughing do you not want me to get them there's so many yeah i i mean i i'm a fan of tattoos so i'm not gonna lie but but at the same time like if you wanted a tattoo i would yeah i would be supportive to you i wouldn't tell you i wouldn't tell you not to do it okay great thank you mommy i'm gonna call my dad now and no i did not just call you mommy i didn't see you mom bye mom bye sweetie i'm gonna show you my tattoos for my video and you gotta tell me if you think it looks good or if you think that i should never get a tattoo ever i think it loki looks dope oh wow yeah it looks it does oh yeah damn what is that one is that a star yes okay so be honest like do you think it's like awful or if i got a tattoo genuinely would you be like i i feel like it matches my personality better than i thought yeah i know i think so i think the key is just like if it's tasteful and it's you you know what i'm saying i thought like at first when i looked at that i thought it was like it was a tattoo of a credit card oh my god represents how we're all controlled by money and society i really like the tattoos i'm excited to take instagram photos with tattoos for the rest of the week it sucks because i do want a tattoo now and now it's like i think i'm less scared of the idea of having a tattoo now because i know that they look badass as [ __ ] i wouldn't go overboard but like a little fun one like on my arm or something wouldn't hurt anyone right like with some like just a little thin line see i'm already scaring myself anyway well comment down below what you guys think i should get tattooed on me why does it look so cool all right guys well it is like 7 p.m now um the sun is going down i made a green tea earlier it's right here isn't that so weird who drinks green tea i'll let you guys know if anything funny happens over the course of the next few weeks while i have these on me but i bet nobody's gonna care because to be honest nobody actually cares about anyone but themselves usually so that is unfortunate but anyway i love you all and i'm going to give you your forehead kiss all right sorry my face is puffy because i did just have a mental breakdown off topic hate the tattoos i hate them i've had them on for about three or four days this one i hate the only one i like is this one this one i think is cute but the rest the ones in my arms it's pissing me off that has shown me and proven to me that maybe tattoos are not for me i'm not a tattoo gal so just thought i'd give you all a little update see ya forehead kiss number two of the video you guys got lucky today [Music]

want to share with you how i get ready to take an instagram photo i have a very specific routine like some of my friends are like hey look what's getting cute take instagram photos like i have a very specific routine for that and i wanted to share it with you guys for some reason as you can see right now i don't look so good if you're wondering like what's going on on my neck and all that just ignore it because it's for a different video anyway well i'm taking an instagram photo today and i'm going to take you through my getting ready process um i don't know if you guys care at all but honestly i would want to know would i if somebody else filmed this video would i watch it i don't know so here's what i do first i wash my face now i've been getting really into skincare and i've been trying out so many different products i did already wash my face this morning so i don't really feel like i need to wash it again so instead i'm gonna try out i've been trying out this new toner um it's a green tea toner when i'm about to do my makeup sometimes i like something thinner so i've been trying this out um i also as you guys know love this one but i like to try new things then there's this serum i guess it's hydrating it's good to hydrate your skin um and last but not least i'm trying out this now i've literally tried this out once it's a moisturizer called whatever i'm trying it out i'm literally trying a bunch of new products so this is like not when you're watching this like these are not products that i've been i know much about i think the key is just to make sure that your your face is moisturized before you start but i feel like you know if you have a go-to moisturizer oh okay so this is a beast that we're gonna how do i make my hair look presentable without having to wash it i might straighten it but i don't like straightening my hair because then it looks too like polished but today my hair is ah frizz god this looks like [ __ ] huh i'm gonna handle the hair later now it's time to pick out an outfit oh i do not know what my vibe is today we're not gonna pick out the outfit yet i just realized that that's a demon i'm not ready to to a dress face is moisturized hair is brushed now we need to move on it's time to do makeup recently i've gotten a lot better at makeup which may seem shocking to some of you but i'm not joking i'm getting kind of good at it even though the lighting in here is never good this is like the first time i've ever done a makeup routine like i never show my makeup because i'm like not proud of like my process but like i'm genuinely like proud of my makeup routine now like i can say that here's what i do emma's makeup tutorial this is the most beautiful product it's called the cosas tinted face oil and i take two colors and i mix them why i don't know okay take this and then i take my whatever sponge i go here in here in here i'm gonna talk about instagram for a second i have been trying recently to like step up my instagram game and listen instagram it bothers me because here's the thing about it it doesn't matter instagram doesn't matter it is the least important thing on this planet yet for some reason there's something so fun about having an instagram where it's impressive i post on instagram like every day which in my opinion is extremely narcissistic but i enjoy doing it for some reason and i don't know what it is like what about posting on instagram is appealing to human beings i just don't understand why i like have this desire to post on instagram so often does it hurt anyone not really so is it an issue i'm putting on a lip balm this one's great this is the capari lip glossy in the like clear clear flavor anyway okay so now that i have all of the foundation layer on i take the tarte shape tape i'm not even sure if this is my color but i use it anyway the thing about this fun this concealer is that it's so thick you can't go wrong also when it comes to placement i really don't know what i'm doing but i'm trying to like learn more about skin care and get really into it shout out to hiram um skincare by hiram if you guys watch him you should if you don't he makes videos about skincare and he just made me all into skincare patting in my concealer this works for my instagram photos and makes me not look awful so i have my nice base on and now we're gonna take some of this chanel powder oh [ __ ] i already kind of showed you guys this routine when i filmed with james we did a video where i did his makeup but i didn't really talk about what i was doing and i also can't do makeup on other people so it was just kind of definitely not a tutorial anyway take a little bit of powder put it on the forehead with this brush that's probably you don't who cares what brush you use you know what i mean put some under the eyes under the eyes is very important but not too much or else there's issues i like to put some on my lid maybe around the nose a little bit not too much not too little just the right amount not like that's good advice it's like how do you take that advice okay so now that i have my base it's time to add some bronzer my favorite bronzer is the butter bronzer that is this from physicians formula this thing is so broken and disgusting but it smells delicious i take this brush that's not meant for bronzing at all i don't think i'm not even kidding like i know this looks crazy but like this is literally how i do it they put a little bit around my nose and on my cheek and i don't even have to blend it or anything because it just kind of blends itself when i'm doing it one time i made a tick tock and everybody was saying that my nose made me look like i was snape from harry potter i it hurt me with eye shadow i really don't know what i'm doing to be honest like i take my bronzer and i cover my lid right which is great i think it does a little bit right if you just slap enough colors on your eyelid like something will look good beauty counter palette what's the the classic eye shadow palette i'm gonna do this one today i just put a little bit of my crease but i'm super bad at blending things into my crease without it looking see that's so dark then i'm gonna take some random big brush that i can find like what's the first one i can find one two three closing my eyes what's the first brush and i'm just gonna mess it around mess it up a little bit okay then i take this angled brush and i take this like orange thing and then i mix it with the brown below it i put it under like as in like as eyeliner under my eye nobody told me to do this but i figured it out on my own and i like how it looks i think then i take the this in the cinnamon and the sable and i mix them and then i do top eyeliner very lightly see like i feel like that's good where's my coffee i cannot continue chamberlaincoffee.com this is a social dog blend very delicious i go in and i take this sparkling ivory color and i put it in my inner corner that's enough eye shadow for me i like to smudge it with my finger i take carmex and i dip you can literally tell that i do this often i dip my well actually you know i'm gonna try a new method today of taking a little bit of carmex putting it on my brow and then brushing through it and it's just because i don't like to fill in my brows at all i really don't i don't like how it looks my eyebrows look too dark and i'm blonde so like making them really harsh is too much but i like them to stay and i feel like carmex is perfect highlighter time anyway back to our instagram conversation to be honest with you i have like in it like it like i get all weird and self-conscious when i'm posting on instagram a lot because even though i enjoy doing it because it's fun to like play dress up i still feel conceited when i'm posting on it a lot and i don't feel like i'm not conceited or narcissistic of a person like i genuinely don't there's something fun about it is that so bad is that so wrong i think i need to put on blush now i don't always put on blush but i'm kind of in a blush mood today i like this one like it's cute oh that's too much that is too much i don't know what i'm doing like i really don't know what i'm doing i'm showing you what i do but that doesn't mean like i do the right thing right i'm also about to start my period i literally can't stop trying to start arguments with people right now because i'm pmsing like you think that you're just being a [ __ ] for no reason and you don't realize that you're being a [ __ ] for a reason and then your period comes and you're like stop doing that i don't yell at my children a lot i'm sorry i don't normally do that okay so now i add my lip product before i do mascara i do mascara very last so that i don't have to do anything else so i use this like buxom lip injection what's it called plumping lip cream it does crazy things kind of like to put on a product first though sometimes like if i add like a little bit of like this just to add like a baseline of color like not a lot see but this to me looks ugly like it doesn't look like i have enough of a lip which is where the lip injection product comes in okay now mascara and then we're done i'm so bad at mascara i'm really bad at it makeup is done now i take the setting spray that probably doesn't do anything and i spray it everywhere for no [ __ ] reason and now it's time to do my hair my hair is in big trouble it's not looking good oh my god i like the cats act like i don't treat them so well they're creating a ruckus as if like i forgot to feed them breakfast i fed them breakfast and i gave them extra food so that they would leave me alone today and they didn't i don't really know what to do when my hair gets fluffy like this so i just try to straighten over it and hope that it like goes down a little bit i do need to turn the temperature off although i think that's bad for your hair but since when have i cared i wish i knew how to like curl my hair like you know people go like that or something oh wait that kind of worked okay we won't be trying new things today i used to never get ready to a point where like i was constantly disgusting like my okay not disgusting that's not because i was clean wasn't my nose dirty even though you guys all thought i was dirty or whatever but i was literally looking back and i was shocked at how like how i never got ready whereas like now i enjoy it like i like getting ready i like doing my hair and makeup i always see things on like tick tock and twitter and [ __ ] that are like cut toxic people out of your life and see how much better you look and i was always like okay like whatever shut up but like very true i cut toxic people out of my life and immediately looked 50 times better but i just didn't look happy or healthy or like anything like that when i talked to people in my life and then i literally was scrolling through the photos and like a few months after i cut out a bunch of people boom rebirth there's still like a lot of not straight pieces in an instagram photo again nobody can tell the details it's not like i'm going to the [ __ ] met gal i'm going into my backyard to take an instagram photo like anyway so hair and makeup is done um this is kind of the most like default basic part because this could like i do this with everything but now we need to pick out the outfit and that's when things get complicated so come on downstairs with me don't forget to turn off your straightener um and now we go downstairs oh my god look who's waiting for me y'all notice i don't like put on deodorant or perfume to take an instagram photo why you may ask nobody can smell me through the phone i just went shopping the other day very irresponsibly i kind of want to wear this top i got this top that is so cool see i kind of want to wear this it is see-through though so how i will cover my boobies is a good question but i kind of want to wear this i've been really wanting to wear this vintage louis vuitton bag that i am borrowing i did not buy this this is a good start though so now we can head to my closet and finish the fifth oh i need to get something to wear under this sheer top that's the one thing about sheer tops it's like it's all fun and games until like you need to figure out what to cover your nippies with i do have a bralette in mind oh here it is oh wait but this is see-through too the [ __ ] okay but maybe double see-through makes not see-through anymore god i just showed my undergarment on youtube i buy any ad revenue i was gonna make on this okay but i don't do this for the money i do it for the relationship i have with you oh we have this top cute we're all lit under it it's literally see this is not somebody's gonna see a nipple and then this bag now it's like what do we wear with it right good question it's a good question i have this pair of levi's that i've been having trouble figuring out how to wear i don't know they look weird it looks like i'm not wearing pants these could be that much and it doesn't really match ah and she didn't even say bless you look at this [ __ ] and she lives under my roof too it's unbelievable these brown pants could work see these are kind of cool if i we're a belt maybe like a black belt okay i'm gonna um get to work trying clothes on i'm wearing a robe yeah see you in a sec uh remember i said this was gonna be easy um i've hated everything that i've tried on i'm wearing a skirt right now i hate it um i might change the whole fit well this is actually cute with the skirt um give me 30 minutes okay i'm done i don't really like this outfit but i never like an outfit before i take an instagram photo so this is like kind of what always happens but i will show you the final product right [Music] so that's it that's how i get ready to take an instagram photo maybe you found it useful if you need a little new instagram photo makeup routine i hope you guys are having an amazing day i love you guys so much for head kiss for you i will never forget again and i'll see you guys next week and follow your dreams and stuff i really i'm honestly if you guys see a photo on instagram in this outfit i'm gonna be really shocked because i kind of hate it you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-09-27T17:46:31Z,303207,6132096,8653,what is this right [Music] i just relaunched chamberlain coffee the whole company she's a whole new [ __ ] i'm so excited to finally tell you about this because i've been working on rebranding chamberlain coffee for ever my team and i have been working for months making this my dream coffee company so before we even get into the [ __ ] video who cares about that i just want to talk about the new chamberlain coffee she's a brand new [ __ ] we changed the whole website we changed the whole aesthetic of the brand the packaging the logo everything like when i opened up this package i felt like i was giving birth um i wanted to show you guys some of the new products and then we can get into the video but i just had to talk about this because i'm literally so excited about it and i'm also going to be using all this in the video today but whatever number one we have whole beans this is the original family blend this is the blend that we started chamberlain coffee with so the one that you know and love these also come in steeped bags look at the new little logo a new blend this is called the early bird blend this is high caffeine content it's a light roast and it's [ __ ] delicious it also comes in the sieved bags okay then we have the night owl blend this one's kind of a dark roast a little bit less caffeine [ __ ] incredible this one's actually one of my favorites if not my favorite but i love them all so it also comes in the steep bags we have the social dog blend this one is very good as well pretty high caffeine but not as crazy as the early birds this one is our highest caffeine blend and last but not least we have the careless clap clap and last but not least we have the careless cat blend also medium rose and this one's a half cap and it's very [ __ ] good oh and then we also have the seat bags for these two but we have more shape we also have reusable straws now okay and to go along with that we now have chamberlain coffee mason jars say hello to the new mugs okay and last but not least we have tote bags tote bag haul logo early bird family social dog night owl careless cat this [ __ ] is amazing i'm so proud of it i'm so excited to announce it to you guys so yeah go shop chamberlain coffee chamberlaincoffee.com it's a whole brand new [ __ ] now link in the description but also you can just go to chairmancoffee.com thank you all for your support and i hope that you love the new blends and you love the new look i love you guys okay but now it's time to get into the meat of the video i have a coffee company it just relaunched we know we know but i find it to be insane that i drink the same coffee drink every day cold brew with almond milk and vegan creamer and then sometimes i'll do espresso with the same two other ingredients i need to like change it up i get so many coffee recipes in my for you page on tick tock and i've been seeing so many recently and i decided why don't i try to make some with you guys maybe we can find a new go-to coffee recipe together i found a bunch of viral-ish coffee recipes on take top and we're gonna make a few [Music] [Music] let's try it listen she kind of made it complicated coffee bae 97 she has amazing videos but the way that she did this was complicated and i'm going to simplify it i'm going to take a few of these reese's peanut butter cups see i'm like a peanut butter [ __ ] i'm just gonna put a few of these in here put some cold brew in it put some milk in it blend she used hot coffee to probably melt them i'm too lazy this is definitely not a healthy coffee drink i didn't think about that i'm gonna take some oat milk because i feel like it's creamy let's do a little bit of that i'm taking some cold brew that i made yesterday took the bags out for aesthetic purposes but um by the way i used i used this one wait where's my blender thing oh no if i lost it i'm gonna [ __ ] freak out should i just like add a spoonful of peanut butter in here just for fun okay let's not be impulsive okay this did not separate well let's pour her over ice this does not look right to me it kind of tastes good though you know you could do okay if you ever make this use a strainer okay so like strain all the chunks out okay reese's peanut butter cup coffee i'm gonna give this a six out of ten it's a waste of time i feel like if i would have strained it it would have been better or if i would have melted the reese's peanut butter cups before but it's also kind of really good so maybe seven out of ten it's not terrible what is next okay so the next one i saw is this one she basically just made a normal latte but added food coloring i want to see if this is a fun experience if it's worth my time if it even like looks cool i think that i'm going to need to froth the milk in order for it to like look cool so i'm going to take some oatmeal put it in this frother thing blue oh my god i put way too much so we have blue milk now we froth it i don't know if i'm doing this right at all oh god it's getting very large no no no okay that hurt my feelings regardless it will be okay so i'm gonna use the same cold brew as last time because i feel like this would work better with cold brew but i don't know okay now for the big reveal see this is just i don't even need to taste this this is more of just like seeing if it looks cool challenge [Music] zero out of ten that is the most terrifying color i've ever seen it's a no from me i love the girl that did this because hers actually looked pretty i wish that i was her i mean it tastes good it's just okay can we please move on okay so so far so bad but i just found this one cereal milk latte that sounds fun to me i even bought this from target today for this because who the [ __ ] just has this around cinnamon toast crunch like so the cinnamon toast crunch is in here it's been in here for a little bit it's soggy for sure i'm gonna kind of like break it up a little bit so that there's more cinnamon toast crunch particles wait this might be [ __ ] fire because the milk in there tastes crazy recently i've been like having dreams and then waking up and thinking that they're real like the other day i like dreamed a conversation with someone and then i like asked them about it the next day and they were like we never had that conversation and i was like oh [ __ ] okay so we have our ow [ __ ] espresso shots in here let's give it a go in order to get maximum flavor out i'm gonna do this maybe i'll put a few of these on top thumbnail thumbnail now that is [ __ ] life-changing okay 10 out of 10. 10 out of 10 cereal milk coffee so good this is so [ __ ] good i didn't think it would work because i thought that the coffee flavor would like overpower the milk i just didn't think that like you were gonna get the cereal flavor in the coffee but like holy [ __ ] okay great we had a success now i can go to bed say bye okay the next one is a little bit more of a healthy option so we're just gonna get into it we use the blender whenever i go to new york i get a like cashew milk latte and it's so good and i've never been able to find anything else like it in la like anywhere like it is one of a kind in new york so i feel like this might replicate it also there's literally residue in here from the last drink but it all mixes together in your tummy right adding some maple syrup look how [ __ ] cute this is like i literally didn't even need to buy maple syrup i have some in my fridge but i saw this and i was like so cute and minnie and then i had to buy it that's kind of how my brain works [Music] that's probably enough then we're going to add some cashews she said to use salted ones which is interesting to me because i'm like wouldn't you not want that maybe it's like a sweet and salty vibe you know a little bit of cashews in there that's probably too many and then last but not least some sandwiches do i even have that i've had this cinnamon for like two years i don't think it goes bad right we're moving quick today guys no need to waste time you know what i mean it's like yeah i'm spending like five seconds on each one but it's like what's the point of spending more time than necessary and make it all intricate and [ __ ] that's not how my brain works i don't care if something looks sloppy as long as i didn't spend a lot of time on it except for the rebrand of chamberlain coffee which i spent months on this looks [ __ ] delicious mmm oh it's like so creamy wait i really like this one oh wow this is a 9 out of 10. it would be a 10 out of 10 if i would have strained it that's a reoccurring issue here there's a lot of little cashew chunks but i actually really don't mind that kind of gives me a little boba vibe i'm impressed it might be a 10 out of 10 for me actually i really love this wow so while the camera was off i was just cleaning my sink real quick in between recipes and um i turned on my garbage disposal and i was poking a little piece of cinnamon toast crunch okay and i was poking a little piece of cinnamon toast crunch down the garbage disposal with this fork and this is a knife with this knife and the garbage disposal just ate it right up it was really scary and it just made me think like what if i put my finger in there okay let's move on [Music] [Music] okay so this guy did a peanut butter latte now listen i kind of want to do my own thing for this i'm going to do i'm going to take the basic premise of it but i'm going to switch it up um which always leads to failure with me i literally used to buy this peanut butter when i was younger it's this brand laurel laura scutter and i would eat it by the spoonful for like just hours on end and then get the worst stomachache on this planet and then would feel like [ __ ] for the rest of the day we're gonna start out with making espresso i could work at a [ __ ] coffee shop so fast look at this [ __ ] [Music] check this no i'm gonna warm up some milk and i'm gonna warm this up for like a minute i normally wouldn't just like add granulated sugar to coffee but this dude did it so i'm gonna like trust him sugar doesn't have a smell did i just discover that or do we all know now that we have this very hot milk i'm gonna take some peanut butter and we're just gonna stir this in now we're gonna add a little bit of sugar it has a lot got our espresso shots peanut butter milk there's chunks of peanuts no it's not bad but you can't taste the peanut butter at all oh i [ __ ] hate this this is like a one out of ten and i love peanut butter so that [ __ ] says something what are we gonna do next i'm starting to get you know what i kind of want to go my own way like i i don't like okay yes it's like fun doing everybody else's recipes but what if i come up with my own that like was that like good acting i was like trying to be like oh i got an idea when i was at the store today i did have a few ideas i wanted to make like a birthday cake coffee so this is what i did you're probably like emma how are you gonna do this i don't know we need to start out by making some espresso i don't think i've ever okay listen i drink a lot of coffee in a day but i've never used my espresso machine this many times in one day she's probably so tired and i feel really bad so check this out while she's brewing so i'm thinking we do we take a similar approach right we do the whole warming up the milk situation right okay we're gonna take some of this sugar cookie mix and then we're gonna take this syrup didn't mean to do that back to work oat milk i'm gonna add a splash of this right this is french vanilla syrup boom then we're gonna add a little bit of this betty crocker mix right this is for sugar cookie but i feel like it would taste good so and i didn't want to go to the cake mix aisle then we're gonna add sprinkle right now we're gonna mix with the dirty knife i feel so bad for my kids in the future because they're gonna be like mommy why is there like a piece of broccoli in my cereal and i'm gonna be like honey because i gave you a dirty spoon we're gonna pour the cake battery oh cake batter coffee recipe from the noggin came up with it let's try it y'all this is good it tastes like birthday cake i mean the sprinkles are all on the bottom which is kind of an l but this is pretty good i would give this an eight out of ten which is telling me that my ideas are actually not so bad which is telling me that i think i need to make another one i'm not gonna lie i'm not gonna lie to you guys i don't feel good i am feeling severely ill but i have one more recipe that i came up with and i think it would be good for halloween god my brain is broken today so here's what i'm thinking a little bit of oat milk why not mix my two favorite things together is this something for my imagination or is this real why do i feel like people eat like caramel and cheese together on apples is that not a thing because i bought caramel sauce i feel like caramel and cheese could be a good like flavor combo i don't know guys this could be good so we're going to be using the strainer right that's dirty as well again it all mixes in the stomach yo this mighty i'm in a crazy mood today we're crumpling a cheese it on top honestly it looks kind of beautiful cheese it latte check cheese it caramel latte cheers i don't really taste the cheez-its at all which makes it taste pretty good honestly it's not terrible but i also don't think you should do it so 5 out of 10 for this one i am going to have explosive diarrhea right now oh my god it hurts my stomach hurts so bad oh my god i'm sitting on the floor because my tummy hurts actually i'm going to lay on the floor because my tummy hurts oh my god okay so i am having excruciating stomach pain but that's okay oh my god it hurts um i hope you guys had fun doing a little coffee taste test with me today um i'm also so excited that the new chamberlain coffee rebrand is out so go shop now if you want chamberlaincoffee.com try some of the new blends figure out one that works for you enjoy it i worked so hard on this [ __ ] and it just feels so good to finally get to show all of you and share it with you guys because at the end of the day that's why i'm doing it so that i can share these things with you guys and i hope you love it and i love all you and i'm gonna go literally have explosive diarrhea so goodbye i'm gonna go blow up the [ __ ] toilet every time i say [ __ ] like that people are like you're so disgusting it's like well why are you watching my videos all i do is talk about pp and poo poo all the time it's like you clicked on this and you knew that that's all i talk about yet you come back for more so you must think that peepee poopoo jokes are a little bit funny huh sorry i almost forgot about the forehead kiss anyway [Music] you

just a mommy and her baby you need to go away now i've been in la for literally six months straight it's terrible now let me explain normally i'm traveling like constantly like i i normally travel like once or twice a month sometimes even more this is the longest i've ever been in la in one city to say the least i'm hurting there's not a lot of places i can go right now because not a lot of things are open and available but i've been seeing a lot of people go on like little staycations in l.a like they go stay at a hotel in l.a for funsies i decided that that's what i'm gonna do today randomly last minute i don't know where i'm gonna stay i don't wanna like so i live in like i don't wanna stay in like my town like i wanna drive maybe like 15 minutes or maybe i'll just go somewhere that's like five minutes away i don't know you know it's funny because i actually just recently stayed at a hotel uh for a few days because my plumbing in my house got all [ __ ] and i had to go stay at a hotel because i didn't have plumbing for a while unfortunately the experience was not relaxing because i was coming back to my own home like once a day to like talk to the plumber and [ __ ] my coffee is done and looks very sexy let's do a little montage [Music] listen what's unfortunate is that i'm about to put this in the fridge and then drink the one that i made yesterday because that one's gonna go bad um before we try to book this trip let me show you these shoes i just bought because i'm [ __ ] obsessed this is my dream shoe green high top [ __ ] converse it literally it couldn't be a better shoe for me it's so perfect they're so perfect so now it's time to book our trip okay so we're at my desk why is the lighting so [ __ ] bad let's say best hotels in l.a los angeles what's today 11th okay so let's say 11th adult one yeah [ __ ] yeah i'm an adult show deals hotels.com let's see what we got like i don't want to stay next to the airport at all let's click five stars let's really treat myself today i've gone on a vacation oh what have i seen beverly hills do the whole beverly hills thing wait i can't sing it's like i need to call some of these places and ask if they're even doing like room service and stuff because to be completely honest i just want to get room service once i'm gonna do a little bit more research i'll get back to you hi um i was just wondering about the covid restrictions [Music] as of right now the pool is operating without any interruptions oh and we're all done it's time to start packing i don't know what she didn't tell me when check-in is check-in time to 3pm 3pm okay great thank you i'm not gonna pack a lot because normally i like over pack when i'm like staying somewhere for one night but like not today packing haul check let's put a little toothbrush in there tooth brush green toothpaste got a razor i'm probably not even gonna shower when i'm there i'm probably going to shower when i get home so also i don't shower anyway right guys okay i think i'm done i do need to pack some skin care i'm just going to pack a moisturizer and call it today toiletries are ready to go got some tampons in there too even though i'm not on my period but when am i not on my period okay well that's done so let's think about this logically i'm gonna be there for 24 hours do i even need to bring a pair of pants like i'm not even packing socks i'm thinking pj outfits so we got some shorts comfy shorts right comfy matching navy blue zip up okay easy done maybe if i need to go in public outfit we could do just some classic blue jeans what maybe a sweater sweater i think that's perfect that was the easiest packing i've ever done this is a challenge can i fit all of it in here let's find out did it but i do need to fit hold on okay it's a little bit jam-packed like this is not comfortable to carry right actually it's not bad okay so that's literally it like i'm literally ready to go so until 3 p.m i'm just gonna pick my ass and do nothing oh i need to bring phone chargers and [ __ ] ah that's always my least favorite thing to pack is like phone chargers and stuff i hate that anyway i'll see you guys at three when it's time to go it's [ __ ] vacation time baby it's now three i fed the cats and now we're headed to the hotel i think it's important to go on vacation by yourself though and like do things by yourself i've always felt like that like i filmed this video last year at a time when like i was it was like being alone to me was like the scariest [ __ ] ever here's the thing about me i always feel like i'm driving wrong even when i'm not i just want to order room service that's like really what i want like i don't even care about staying at a hotel i just like room service also my car is disgusting i just looked down on my seat and i have like [ __ ] indian food on my seat because i was eating indian food in my car the other day it's really good but this year hasn't been like the craziest year of my personal life but like wow what a year we've had you know what i mean it's just blowing my mind also the sweater i'm wearing as a hole in my armpit oh my god i didn't even bring a [ __ ] bathing suit so i can't go swimming in the pool but to be completely honest with you i don't really want to swim in a pool anyway that's not my energy today you know it's really interesting because i feel like when i get really worn down like if i overwork myself or something like that and i get really like exhausted and i exhaust myself blah blah blah it doesn't take me long to recharge like my dad is always like emma it doesn't take that long to recharge like it doesn't all you need is like 12 hours to recharge and then you're good it's like if you charge your phone but you don't go on it the whole time it's charging that thing's going to charge twice as fast same thing with your mind ted talk if you guys want to have me on you just saw what i'm capable of the metaphors are there the passion is there um what was that sound was that my own throat i heard a really loud beeping sound um did my like throat like glitch like was that literally my own throat my nails fell off so i'm just like nail this oh god i shouldn't be doing that me looking around to see if i'm gonna get pulled over for that i like really need to be careful i don't know why i'm so dumb i'm also being watched by the people in the card to the left of me so i need to go by [Music] i'm here and holy [ __ ] this hotel is so nice wanna see room tour there's me i do not look like i belong in this hotel cool closet which i won't need considering i bought two outfits bathroom or toilet shower that i won't be using because you know me guys oh cute let's sit outside and talk can i open is it a push oh holy [ __ ] look at all that smoke literally how do these doors work get it let's talk i'm very excited to spend the next few hours in here until i go to sleep and then wake up and leave first i need to find the room service menu so give me 30 seconds to do that oh wait there's an ipad oh they give you a [ __ ] ipad what is this oh my god i can change the temperature in the room cool in room dining done check this out it's a little techie thing cool oh half roasted heirloom cauliflower i like that what if i just got the seasonal soup and just like wong it like even if it's bad it's like whatever i'm gonna put in the comments i'm gonna say only if it's vegan cool but also they have a spa here i'm kind of interested in that oh no the spa is closed great you know what i could do i could make a coffee here it's not gonna be chamberlain coffee because i forgot to bring something but better than nothing ryan can they bring me ice like should i call them and ask them to bring me up ice or like do they have an ice machine like what do i do oh let's open this all the way how do i open this is it like a remote control or something i hate technology alexa open the blinds i'm just gonna keep there's literally an alexa here i'm literally just gonna keep giving alexa demands until she like does something alexa what's the weather right now or something alexa you suck you are not doing your job alexa open the blinds okay alexa open the curtains okay apparently not okay because they're not opening what am i missing something oh my god maybe i use the [ __ ] ipad the nifty ipad maybe she doesn't open all the way but now it's just bugging me hi um i just was wondering if i could order a bucket of ice or if there's like an ice machine thank you so much should i have ordered almond milk too all right so the espresso machine is right here you guys can't really see it come on make my coffee stuff that's loud it's good wait supposedly they have a snap heavy this is a massive thing of ice time to make a little americano because i don't have any milk that is vegan so so i'm gonna give this hotel a review so far so i've been here for about 20 minutes um and so far i'm gonna give it a nine out of ten lots of technology which is like kind of a bummer um it kind of makes things a little bit more confusing for me which i don't like but at the same time the quality of everything has been really amazing so far like the way that they just sent like enough ice for 40 people up to my room when i asked for ice uh gonna make a little americano here i don't know if that was a good idea i actually kind of like it it tastes like iced tea but like coffee version i'm gonna give this hotel like a nine out of ten no wait like a seven out of maybe eight eight out of ten but i'm also starting to feel like i i wanna go home i'm gonna find the snack menu that'll make me happy oh my god i wonder if they're gonna have breakfast tomorrow morning [Music] that sounds delicious gummy pandas coconut water right so none of that none of the snacks are speaking to me but maybe later i'll order none of it [Music] what the [ __ ] oh my god this is kind of cute thumbnail wow the lighting is kind of beautiful so this is the funniest [ __ ] i've ever seen it's soup though wait oh is that soup this is the soup kind of scared of that but anyway cream of corn kind of good actually i'm gonna get the cream of corn like an eight out of ten cause i normally hate cream of corn and this is not bad i'm gonna commend their service waiter walked in such an angel i mean just like was so polite and awesome so that was a great experience um so definitely 10 out of 10 on service next i'm eating this cauliflower bread this might give me diarrhea but the cream of corn is going to do that on its own so might as well just hit me while i'm down you know what i mean the cauliflower is a seven out of ten because like i've had better cauliflower it's just maybe not my style the bread's probably like a seven out of ten two it's really good but maybe if i dip in the soup go crazy let's try the mixed green salad is there even dressing on this did they not give me dressing they didn't okay watch this creativity i'm gonna put the cauliflower sauce on my salad nobody thinks like me you know kind of genius see maybe it'd be better if i was not in la still like i literally just went to a hotel in l.a we'll have fun we'll make it fun i don't know how but we will yay i'm gonna have a pillow fight with myself that actually hurts maybe if i eat this piece of cauliflower like it's a piece of corn it'll be fun there's a girl eating cauliflower in her room staycations in a sense may not be for me and i'll explain why i think i get really bad anxiety a staycation for me is not really a staycation because i know how close to home i am so it's like hard for me not to just want to go home and sleep in my own bed part of me is like okay well you're here emma like this is fun and like enjoy it but then the other half of me is like well i kind of want to just cuddle with my cats y'all the more i eat the more i want to go home why am i like this i'm here to what relax what relaxes me more than tick-tock nothing so i just watched tick-tocks for way too long and then i was like okay wait emily you're here you're in a hotel room do something that you wouldn't do at home i realized hello i have a bathtub so check out what i'm gonna do emma's taking a bath i already have a tummy ache from the cream of corn that i ate because dairy doesn't agree with me but we're having fun right bath salts oh it smells good this is fun maybe i'll make myself an ice water for the bath check it out i'm losing my mind great bath is done why is my bath blue unfortunately i cannot film me in the back maybe i'll figure out an angle look at me it's friday right now and i'm filming this tgif everybody hi everyone i'm in the tub as you can see unfortunately this is the angle that we're getting um i do have a phobia that something's reflecting my nude body right now it's weird when you're in your own home you become blind to things that are there that you don't use like i never use my bathtub for some reason and i've never used it actually i'm just gonna sit in here and i didn't bring my phone in here so i could just really think about who i am and why i'm such a mess all the time and all that so all right how do i turn this off without flashing the camera i know i was anxious earlier i know i was like oh i want to go home um that is over that bath just reset that was good um definitely would recommend taking baths if you guys get anxious or whatever i never have tried that but i feel like my whole body is like not as tense i feel like i'm constantly living in a very tense state like my jaw's always tight not right now dude at all i feel like all my muscles are like jelly i did throw up a little bit but yeah you know what this is actually really nice you know maybe i should have some time to myself with the camera off just dance around my room listen to copyrighted music or just lay in bed and watch more tech talks don't tell anyone hey um it's been a few hours it's night time now it's dark there's been like a bunch of police activity near here so i'm a little bit frightened but whatever i've decided i'm gonna learn a tick tock dance and i wanted to take you guys along with the journey unfortunately you're gonna have to go to my tick tock to find out what song i use because we will get copyrighted so i also have water all over my face because i feel spilled water on my face um we're going in the bathroom because this is where i film tic tocs [Music] this is embarrassing oh this is not going yeah so that's not going on the internet back to bed for me but i am enjoying being in this room now i do feel like i'm not at home which is kind of unsettling in a weird way but also like definitely a relief you know what i think it really is i think going on vacation or kind of like getting yourself out of your home it makes you appreciate your home a lot more you know [ __ ] isn't so bad after all right it's so funny because it's like friday and it's like i want to do something kind of fun and crazy but also like what does that even mean like what do i do that's fun and crazy besides online shop nothing hotel check roxanne copyright check i'm about to go to bed i decided i'd order a little something before bed a fruit and berry bowl that sounds nice i'll get the sorbets too [ __ ] it get some lemon sorbet before i go to bed i thought we could have a little sleepover moment like talk about our feelings and stuff like we're at a sleepover if you're not watching this at like night time maybe save this part there is a weird smell coming from it it's either berry very good berry what do people talk about at sleepovers ow brain freeze super long nilla wafer check this lemon sorbet is crazy you know what i want to talk about dragon fruit is it just me or does that [ __ ] have no flavor at all they look so pretty but they don't have any flavor in other news i've been watching the i don't know if you can see what it is but if the tv in the back it's just been playing a commercial for this hotel the entire time i've been here and to be completely honest with you i spent an hour watching it pineapple check very good it's literally 9 45 and my ass is going to bed soon you know what the one good thing that quarantine did for me i used to go to bed at like 2 30 in the morning and wake up at like 11 00 a.m which is totally fine but i didn't love it guess what i do now bed at like 10 30 11 30. wake up at 7 30. you know what's funny i love honeydew flavored stuff but when it comes to the actual fruit itself i'm iffy on it so let's see see it's not for me i think it's a pointless fruit it's weird like sometimes like i like grapes like i'll eat grapes non-stop but grape flavored stuff couldn't be me you know i'm really glad that we had this time together i'm really glad that me and you got to have a little sleepover it wasn't the smoothest ride emma got a little bit anxious emma wanted to go home because emma likes to feel safe in her bed but then emma came around and ended up having a great evening you know what is always the weirdest part at a sleepover okay how does this happen every sleepover i've ever been at it's like all of a sudden the room goes silent and everybody just knows that it's bedtime like who stops talking first is it even is it like an energy thing like everybody knows it's like you know what i mean how do we know last thing i'm gonna say before i go to bed let's bring back tgif like thank god it's friday i miss saying that so let's bring back tgif and i think that's what i'm gonna leave you guys with tonight this is also reminding me of a video i literally made three years ago i turned 17 yesterday surprisingly i know i don't look like it but we don't need to talk about that i'm trying to fight some of y'all that were nice to me when i had a voice like that when my voice was all like hey like literally listen to her talk for one second and tell me you don't want to kill her you know what everyone needs to shut up she had her moment she had her time to shine and the new emma's here and do we like her on that note haha so funny because like i was like fake snoring like really fast okay for real good night though good morning i just got the best night of sleep ever i don't know why i slept so well 7 45 i did eat a lot of dairy yesterday i do feel like something bad's gonna happen with my tummy good morning la maybe it's not so bad here after all i feel like i'm in europe for some reason that view kind of looks like europe except minus the palm trees well thank you guys for hanging out with me thank you guys for coming on a trip with me uh i can't wait oh shut up oh shut up i'm excited to go home but also i had a good time i took a bath and i had a pillow fight you know ate a nice meal make that two actually thanks for coming along with me i'm out of here see ya thanks for watching guys love you guys so much see you next week all right i'm going home so [Music] [Applause] okay bye

-emma chamberlain",2020-09-13T17:16:46Z,351837,7022060,14068,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey bye i look like i have been hit by a bus [Music] hi guys um it is early in the morning which is why my hair is not brushed and i look like [ __ ] and all that not that i don't look like [ __ ] a lot in my videos because that's my brand or whatever but anyway i wasn't gonna film today but then i got this genius [ __ ] video idea let's talk about it here's what's going on this morning i had an idea why do i try to talk when i make coffee because the problem is that it's so loud that you can't hear me anyway i have a lot of clothes in my closet and a lot of the clothes that i have in my closet have been in there for like five years it takes a lot for me to like put something in the giveaway pile mainly because i always tell myself emma you could flip this like you could crop it so that's what i'm gonna do today i'm gonna take some of the things in my closet that i never wear and i'm gonna flip them and i'm gonna turn them into something i would wear um which means i might crop it i might paint it i might who knows i think it would be nice to do a little a little cute activity today and this also will prevent me from shopping more because i have a serious shopping issue chairmancoffee.com the first step is that we need to go into my closet and figure out what has potential what hasn't been worn in a while etc etc and then we can kind of go from there i think this is going to be especially useful with pants for some reason i have a lot of pants that are like too long for me and then i never wear them because they're too long okay wait also my closet is a mess it's not good let's start with pants okay the first thing i have that i might want to do something to do i want to do something to these no i don't okay first thing i actually saw these yesterday in my closet these are some green pants that are very cute but they're way too long these need to be cropped if they were cropped a whole different pant 50 times better but also check this out these pants are the same way they're black pants actually kind of a similar no they're not similar at all extremely long these jeans i don't like i ordered them and like there was something about the button that i didn't like but i feel like if i painted them or something they could be better oh okay so these i thrifted these they're kids pants the problem with them is that they're too they fit super weird um but i feel like if i turn them into like maybe some sort of cargo short they could be cool instead of wasting all of the room in my sd card i'm going to find some [ __ ] and then i'll be back it's been a few minutes i found a bunch of shirts i feel like i want to do something bigger so i think i'm going to paint a pair of shoes because i have a lot of pairs of shoes that i just don't like these so i got these yellow air forces and they're really cute but for some reason like i never wear them actually i don't know if i want to paint these they're kind of amazing but i do i could paint these so i think we're ready um i think we're ready to get started let's get started this video is basically just me cropping everything i own the thing is i'm too lazy to try everything on and like mark it so i'm literally just gonna like eyeball it this is not smart literally eyeballing it this could go really bad okay see already this is so much cuter oh hopefully i didn't crop it too short one down next we have this okay this is funny because this is literally a workout top but i feel like it could be cute if i crop it i got this from depop and i didn't realize it was a literal dan skin [ __ ] running workout top it also has a built-in bra which i kind of want to cut out but i don't know if that will ruin the whole entire hello ew i literally ever since i was younger cannot stand anything built-in built-in underwear built-in bra i actually could cut it out it just might take me like 45 minutes so you know what that means i'm not gonna do it the thing is too there's this like hack when you're cropping stuff where if you put a hanger in it so you like put it in a hanger and then you crop it it like stays straighter i don't want to go get a hanger if i knew how to sew that's something i've always wished i was good at i always i've always wished that i was good at sewing i'm like not in a mental state where i want to learn things right now i just kind of want to already know how to do stuff i would love to just be able to like go into the ocean and surf really well instead i'm not that good at it and so it's not fun to do it that is definitely something to talk about with the therapist for me because something tells me that's not the way i'm supposed to be thinking about things this top i've had for over a year like probably two years maybe and i've been waiting to crop it and i just never had the energy to do it but now here we are yeah that's gonna be really short huh okay well it's too late now i used to crop [ __ ] way too short always so i'd like go shopping buy something and then crop it too short and then i could never wear it like this is not gonna fit i don't even want to wait for the big reveal for this top i want to see it now and see how short it is okay i actually did a good job you see the blood in my pants i um have this severe issue with bleeding through uh tampons people like say that it's gross they're like yeah you're so gross because you bleed in your pants and it's like well it's not my fault that i've had a period for two months oh my god let me get into that i mean two weeks i've been on my period for two weeks straight i need to go to the doctor because there's something wrong with me i think i'm also really sad to cut this shirt because this shirt has such a cute it says gumby goes for gold and it's so cute i almost want to turn this bottom part into something like should i turn into a headband gumby goes for gold headband no okay this shirt is so incredibly boring as well as being incredibly boring you know i have these fabric markers that i've never used i feel like i could spice it up maybe like use black ink and like write something fun on it like something like [ __ ] everyone oh my god today i was on amazon and i was looking for like a graphic tee don't ask there was a reason and i'm not gonna get into it but there was a [ __ ] shirt on amazon that said yi y-e-e-t or be yeted who writes this stuff they're [ __ ] genius okay i also really like this yellow color and i kind of want to turn this into like a cute like kind of rustic headband honestly it's not terrible but it's a little bit like why don't i just order a pack of headbands off amazon vibes what do i put on it i want to write something well first i kind of want to test it oh my god i might [ __ ] jesus i'll test it on here like how does the fabric marker look oh terrible it looks really bad and maybe i'll paint on it instead i did bring my paint what should i paint on here what if i wrote tgif on it like thank god it's friday and then i could wear this shirt on fridays i like that brown could be kind of cute because i am very into brown and then it's like pee pee poo poo chat because it's like pee color and poopy color do you guys laugh at poop jokes i do like i love poop and pee i love potty humor like it's so funny to me i'm kidding cut out the part that said that i was kidding because i'm not kidding is the universe trying to tell me not to use brown because this [ __ ] is not opening for me god this is gonna splatter oh god it looks like i shoved this up my butthole i want to make it look kind of messy like in kind of homemade my cats are being extremely loud mommy's putting tgif on a shirt right now honey i've been really loving to say tgif recently like i genuinely say this frequently so it's kind of funny although it's like actually not funny like if [ __ ] off-white sold this everybody would be like oh or like supreme or something everybody would lose their mind you know the song um by katy perry that's like i think it's called tgif or it's called last friday night or something there's a line in there that's like very inappropriate and as a kid i used to like sing it anyway because i didn't know what it meant obviously i remember one time i sang it in front of my dad and he was like emma do you know what that means and i was like yeah anyway i didn't and i learned later what it meant and it was very sad and scary to me and i was like oh why did i say that it's crazy because when you see this shirt on my instagram don't act like you don't know the inside joke like now you're officially a part of the tgif inside joke tgif i mean it's definitely not the best thing i've ever created but i don't hate it so that was good okay painting check it's the creativity for me okay wait let's actually talk about that trend you know how everybody's like it's the blank for me um i hate that trend it's the getting period stains and all your sweatpants for me it's the old pair of air force ones that you've been wearing for two years for me like that's what people would be saying to me the truth of the matter is though for me is that when things are cropped it's easier for me like what if i wore this with a turtleneck under it that would be way cooler than me just wearing a like long awkwardly length like you know what i'm saying this shirt might be not fixable you know what my favorite time okay wait here's the fun fact about me my favorite part about christmas when i'm cutting wrapping paper and then i like just hit i hit it just right that sounded inappropriate and it goes and it just like glides through the [ __ ] wrapping paper and it's just like i don't know this shirt i don't actually hate it in its normal form but i do think that i'd wear it more in if it was cropped if i wore low-waisted pants like i could wear longer shirts but the problem is that i'm only wearing high-waisted pants and then it's all bunchy actually this shirt's really cute so i'm kind of bummed out that i'm cropping it but i like i know that it's like it's the reason why i bought it i bought it so i could crop it and like i don't think i'm gonna like it if i don't so this is what we're doing but if i regret it it'll be a bummer honestly i really thought this shirt was gonna be a fail but it wasn't so that's a really good sign anyway this is cute although this might be too short cute now it's we're getting into dangerous territory which is pants are the cat the cats are literally banging on my door like can you guys get a [ __ ] job or something first we're trying these these i'm really excited for because i really like these pants they're really cool amazing details the only problem is that they just have the worst fit i have these as a guide because i think the key like when you're cutting is to use a guide where'd i put the sizzies i'm just gonna send it oh that those are kind of dope and they ended up being the perfect length for the ah okay that was a [ __ ] serve these might be like amazing ah also if you remember these pants you're you're a real one i'm using them as the guide today these look way better guys i could have like a whole new wardrobe real quick i'm excited to be able to wear these [ __ ] pants i don't know what it is but whenever i buy like i i think well i think i'm just sure yeah these look way better too yay i hate when i look at my phone and no one texts me like i know that's something that everybody says they're always like oh when you check your phone and you have no notice but it's [ __ ] true that [ __ ] bums me out so because these are black i think it should be fun to do like cool doodles around like this front area and then like this back area like you know i hope this marker works on these shoes we'll find out right now let's see oh i don't think it works yeah now that [ __ ] doesn't work okay what if i did cow print that's kind of basic like i feel like everybody does cow print what i'm thinking is what if i paint all of this brown okay this isn't working either okay i have an idea so i have these other fabric markers that are white i have no patience today do you want to know why though because i've been on my [ __ ] period for two weeks i feel like [ __ ] my body is not feeling good i'm gonna draw with this white fabric pen on the black part that could look cool hold on unfortunately i don't really like what i did and i don't think i would wear these anymore like this than i would normally uh actually in fact probably less oh my god these look like they're [ __ ] off-white shoes um i don't like them so if anybody wants these and is a size six and a half in women's uh let me know because i [ __ ] don't like them at all these are not these are i'm donating these you know what and so hopefully somebody else likes them like i really i really think it's possible and they're gonna have one cool shoe and i mean it's something different but these are for me uh this was the fail of the video uh these shoes i'm really angry at myself currently um i will be looking up a way to remove fabric paint unfortunately that's the whole point of fabric paint it doesn't come out uh but last but not least we're gonna ruin this pair of pants so let's [ __ ] do that first i'm gonna color this button because this button is what bothers me the most oh and of course it doesn't stick okay do you know what no emma don't give up oh my god this is like you guys are really seeing like a true breakdown right now and the fabric marker looks like [ __ ] i'm gonna style these clothes now and see if i how i did like did i transform the [ __ ] in a good way did i even transform it at all is it better now is it worse now like that's what we're gonna find out [Music] wow so much better i like it oh my god i did not shave my legs i didn't like it before and i don't really like it now so we were due for a little fail which we did we failed multiple times we failed with the jeans we failed with the air force ones that are now damaged permanently i mean we definitely made our [ __ ] ups today we made our fair share this is cute now i actually love it [ __ ] yeah [Music] like if off white sold this if supreme sold this everybody would be like now that's a cool shirt crazy story real quick before i put on the next outfit the weirdest [ __ ] happened i could not find this shirt for like 20 minutes those two doors have been closed this entire time i've been filming i opened the door and this shirt is just sitting in my hallway outside of my door my thing is how the [ __ ] did it get there and do i have a poultry guys i'm a little bit frightened by it but alas looks like a workout top that moms would wear i like it [Music] okay this is cute not too bad only three fails and the rest were actually pretty good so anyway this was my last one so let's come to my bed whoa here i am back in bed well actually i didn't start this video in bed but chamberlaincoffee.com thank you all for watching thank you all for putting up with my two weeks of menstruation attitude menstruation means having a period for those of you who don't know yes i have an attitude right now yes i'm a little bit passive-aggressive but the fact that you guys are here for me at my highest of my lowest keeps me going i wanted to be a little bit more creative and like draw on things and like you know like paint on things but it turns out we just got the scissors out and just slightly changed each piece but this is a good thing a good learning lesson because if you guys have a piece where you're like eh like i don't really like i you know these pants are too long but they fit everywhere else blah blah blah just take out your scissors and cut them yourself you know what i mean anyway i love you all have an amazing day here's your little forehead kiss can't believe that's our thing now and i love you all have the best day [Music] [Applause] bye [Music] you

-emma chamberlain",2020-09-06T22:46:33Z,435920,7472554,17481,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys did i wear this hoodie in like my last video whatever [Music] hi everyone i have been thinking about making this video for a really long time but it was never the right time you know the title is how to get over a mental breakdown how to recover from a mental breakdown something like that one of my favorite things to do on the internet is fart burp and over share and drink coffee cameron coffee.com well let me over share a little bit i mean i never hurt anyone except for me later when i have to watch it and then my family and friends watch it and they're like am i why are you like are you okay and i'm like ah no um anyway so basically i had a mental breakdown yesterday let's just keep it plain and simple the reasoning for my mental breakdown was basically i just have really really bad anxiety sometimes i go through phases where it's just like really really bad it affects my self-esteem and like my friendships and my relationships because i feel like everybody hates me regret everything i've ever done you know just basically the worst emotions that you could have um i just was so anxious yesterday and i actually talked to a therapist on the phone it actually really helped i feel a little bit better today but i'm not gonna lie i'm very emotionally drained um and so basically i think today i'm going to use this video as inspiration to kind of have a normal day because it's like 2 30 and i've been in bed all day the only thing i've done is feed my cats and eat i think the first step is i need to clean up a little bit my hygiene i haven't brushed my teeth yet today i haven't washed my face i think all that would be nice to do let's head to the bathroom and do that i feel disgusting i also just got my roots done and they're super blonde now it looks like i have one long forehead so okay now i need to brush my teeth i also need to pee my question is like there are so many things i know that i could do that would make me feel better for example i have like 20 packages that need to be opened right now there's nothing like i've never wanted to do something less anyway face is clean i'm gonna go i'm gonna pee pee like i'm gonna pee while i'm brushing my teeth rub a little something on my face just to kind of bring some hydration back into it god i got really red from that okay i think i know what we need to do to be honest i think the first thing i need to do is be productive which means i need to open all of these packages cute wow cute what is this oh god oh these will be a challenge to style but i will figure it out fun fun oh deodorant for all you guys that say i'm stinky take it back oh cool are these gonna fit cool lamp cool oh hello thanks bliss what is that a shirt okay cute cute okay so that was pretty much the most pointless 10 minute clip of my life because i did nothing except for open packages and say three words cool cool cool cute cute cute that is unfortunate wait what is this oh cute they're little peaches oh let's go make coffee it's actually come to my attention that my kitchen is kind of a mess i will show you ew so let's fix that i've had these flowers in my home for far too long and they are all dead you know what it never hurts to oh my god i am out of disinfecting wipes um i wanted to fully clean up but sometimes things don't go our way i think that a little coffee could help maybe after i drink coffee maybe i'll put on like a comfy but cute outfit like this is comfy but not very cute i also ran out of coffee beans so the question is which one am i gonna use today these are in fact samples for chamberlain coffee that are a secret wait are they still a secret i don't know if they're a secret by the time you see this chamberlaincoffee.com and see if it's a secret still or not god that's such a nice extraction getting over a mental breakdown is not there's no specific like formula to it you know it takes time to mentally recharge yourself and a lot of that time is spent in bed in my opinion this actually already made me feel better the thing is i know that doing chores will make me feel good about myself but i don't want to do them it's this conflict it's like i know that if i do some chores like i'll feel so good but alas that is the last thing i want to do i'll do some chores i think a good way to stay in good spirits while trying to refine your stability is to give yourself realistic goals and like right now i know that i can't do a bunch of chores i just don't have it in me but doing like one or two small chores is gonna help me feel better for example cleaning the litter box if you guys have a lot of mental struggles yourself consider getting cats i mean obviously a dog helps too but like to be honest i really don't think dogs like there's something about it's like i love dogs so much when they're not mine actually that's not really true i kind of hate other people's dogs like i just don't want to take care of a dog you like get to like snuggle the dog and be like i get to snuggle my cat no the problem with like this whole process of like making yourself feel better and recovering when you freak out is like trying to figure out what areas it feels right to push in what areas it doesn't sometimes you're like i need to go get some fresh air and that's like the right thing to do but sometimes it's like going and getting fresh air will take too much out of you and will emotionally drain you even more so it's like finding that bounce whenever i like am in the midst of it i can't make a decision like right now i want to be by myself like the thought of being around others pains me cat poo check that's not the best strategy all right we got a chore done [ __ ] god listen you guys i don't know what i was gonna say i'll see you when i figure out what else i wanna do okay i'm back in bed i need to rest some more that is a-okay i feel like i got a few things done and now it's time for me to get back into bed drink my coffee chamberlaincoffee.com i'm gonna lay here and relax for a little bit until i have another little burst of energy the thing is you have to follow your it's all intuitive you know what i mean if you're like i think i have enough energy to go do some chores then go do some chores because you'll feel really good after i feel like you know what there's no way i'm doing chores today then just lay in bed all day but it's intuitive you have to listen to your body if you don't know what the word intuitive means you can totally google it or you can just use context clues and figure it out totally up to you i'm gonna watch tick tocks and disappear into my heating pad another thing that's really comforting get a heating pad trust me on that oh i made a mistake i just went down an internet rabbit hole that made my anxiety very very bad my dad always tells me that when you spend too much time on the internet looking at stuff reading all of it it's almost like you enter that world and then it's like really hard to get your head out of it but i alas i'm very anxious and also i'm very red which makes me feel very insecure but you know what it's okay so i decided that i think it would be good for me to leave the house and do something relatively productive the other day i went to this pottery place with my friend olivia and i'm feeling like maybe i should go there again and just paint a pot or something and then that'll help relax me and then when i get home maybe i'll exercise or something i'm very anxious the first step would be to get into a cute outfit i feel like i need to go out on the town and stunt on the hose a little bit these shorts are cute this little top i don't know it's all about like trying to change your attitude i'm gonna really stand here for a second and really try to change my attitude okay so hopefully that worked um okay i think that that matches i really don't know um i don't care see when i change oh good i'm wearing this little shirt jean shards red converse you know what it's comfortable actually i need to call the place hi can i just walk in or do i have to make an appointment you can just walk in let's go paint some pottery not make the pottery just paint it because painting is hard enough i think the key is to give yourself tasks that you relatively enjoy doing that will keep you off your phone and keep your mind focused on something so very excited okay bye the first time i went to this place it was only babies so it was like me there painting pottery and then babies it's great because babies don't judge you you know what i mean they don't even have brains really let's say i was going to something like the mall which obviously i don't even think malls are open right now but whatever i would be at risk of being judged by 8th graders the oldest person i'm probably gonna see will be the person working at the front desk and they're probably 40 and they're probably like really into pottery and don't give a [ __ ] about me that's perfect the last time i did this i didn't go on my phone for literally an hour straight which is like a world record for me considering i've been very addicted to my phone for the past few weeks so i'm very excited to see how this goes and take you guys along with me um i also look really no do you know what i'm gonna say something else emma you look great it's not true but you want to know the craziest thing about me though that i don't understand i could be having like severe self-esteem issues feeling super bad about myself and just like cry for an hour about it and i kid you not 20 minutes after i cry about it i will be taking selfies it happens every time this car is also really bothering me can you i don't know i think unstable emma is kind of charming right like she's not terrible she's real come on this is what you guys signed up for my body temperature is always way too hot and like my face is always so red like my face is so red right now i can't win did i the question is did i shed a few tears on the way here the answer is yes which means that we need pottery more than ever i called my mom that's always that will send you down the spiral you know what i mean and then it just went south but we are alas at the pottery place so i'm gonna go [ __ ] paint a pot i wish i got this on [ __ ] camera but i didn't but i'm so annoyed about something that just happened while i was painting i felt so much better until a family walks in and it's like a mom and like the two daughters or whatever and obviously i'm there by myself which is you know kind of a not super common thing but like yes i am painting pottery by myself yes it's primarily children i don't [ __ ] care i will do anything that will help this [ __ ] comes up to me this mom she's a mom she should know how to [ __ ] treat children although i know i'm not a child anymore i'm 19 but still i'm still a child she [ __ ] comes up to me and she's like do you like her and i was like no and then she gave me a weird look and i was like i just have anxiety like this really helps me with that and then she was like okay and foley gave me the craziest attitude i almost started crying i literally got up and i left it was just so rude who gives a [ __ ] why i'm painting pottery i have so much pent-up anger about that that i believe that i need to exercise maybe this is why i don't film when i'm having a breakdown or maybe i should start doing it more this video could possibly be the most entertaining video on my channel or the least entertaining video we will soon find out i need to be by myself now oh oh emma is unstable i cried about that i did cry about that this video is about recovering from a mental breakdown when you have a mental breakdown you're very vulnerable so any minor inconvenience of sorts will make me cry actually i called my dad just now and i told him about it and he was like that's just mean my tears are dried we're fine i took some cute selfies of me crying that's the whole point of it all isn't it you gotta think about the [ __ ] that you say to other people like i i mean i don't even think about it like that often you know what i mean i don't really think about like the impact that like what i you really don't know what someone's going through because on a normal day like this wouldn't have bugged me i would have just been like okay that was kind of rude but like whatever something like that just sent me over the edge she doesn't know that but like that's a food for thought but anyway i think i know what i'm gonna do for the rest of the day i'm excited about it you know um i think i'm gonna work out and then i'm gonna shower and get into comfy clothes and then i'll go get food somewhere and take myself to dinner so but definitely get the food for pickup because apparently me doing things by myself attracts judgment noted i hope i don't cry about this one again okay it is now evening time um i was going to exercise there was a lot of things i was gonna do i was like you know what i'm gonna exercise i'm gonna put all my clothes away unfortunately none of those things are going to be happening and instead i'm going to get a vegan burger from this place called montes this is what i truly want to do with my evening so i'm doing it i actually feel a lot better now i think that i got out so many different tears um today that i feel a lot better i do feel like i've been watching too much tick tock and i do feel like that tends to get into my head there's just so much information in a short amount of time it makes me feel anxious and like overwhelmed i'm gonna make crying on youtube trendy again that's my goal i want to start crying in my videos just cause like why not i think it's the next big thing and i want to be the one to start it like i feel like we should start documenting our mental breakdowns can i tell you after i cried to you guys or after i like wipe my tears off and talk to you guys about me being judged at color me mind i actually felt a lot better i'm starting to use all of my platforms as therapy so my podcast therapy for me uh now it's actually um infusing my youtube channel should i be faking it for the cam or no what are we thinking uh i do have a stomach ache which is unfortunate i also have gas see now i'm getting a little bit too comfortable god the camera is just not in the right spot goodbye that whole process took me an hour because it took me about half an hour to park and then um the line was super long so then it took me another 30 minutes there so and then i lost my car for a little bit when i was trying to find it yeah and i have my veggie birds wrapped in lettuce boring but i'm unsure if this is something i should be eating on camera and just like that it was gone okay so the burger's gone um i don't think i've ever eaten that fast in my life i'm sick of myself you guys are sick of me like let's just end this go watch something else on youtube now but anyway i hope you guys enjoyed thank you for coming along that emotional journey there's people walking by my car can act normal for a moment while they're walking by anyway i'll see you guys next week thank you guys for always being there for me hanging out with me feeling pain with me feeling joy with me and i'm gonna give you a little forehead kiss because i know that's our thing now that i give you guys a little forehead kiss so here it is i hope you leaned in hopefully you guys have a more emotionally stable day than i do today or tomorrow okay bye [Applause] i'm very anxious

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-08-23T17:48:07Z,258813,5170549,12183,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] chamberlaincoffey.com cooking with emma is back [Applause] [Music] i moved i have a new kitchen and i want to use it i also have been seeing all of these things recently that i really want to cook i never get super excited about cooking like that's not something that excites me but at the same time sometimes i see things and i'm like i really really want to know if i could make that and we're cooking two things number one cheese board yes i printed out a photo i printed out a photo that's kind of embarrassing that i did that isn't it a vegan cheese board which is probably gonna go absolutely terribly but whatever i'm also cooking spicy pasta you know the like famous pasta that like everybody talks about i feel like in the past with cooking with emma i hated it because i was like i was setting myself up for failure i never prepared well enough the recipes always were a flop everything bad happened and that was what was fun about it but guess what i am growing up and it's time for me to learn how to cook because i'm starting to feel bad about myself because i'm almost in my 20s so first we're making a cheese board to be honest the reason why we're making the cheeseboard first is because i literally don't think that i can do a full comprehensive cooking experience yet it's like literally 10 in the morning like i'm not ready for that yet this cheese is very scary um i got all vegan cheeses ew there's liquid oh this is not and this is going straight actually it kind of tastes good honestly i should have just bought normal cheese and like had diarrhea like it probably like i don't know why i didn't just do that but i'm taking some vegan gouda that actually smells pretty accurate so that's exciting let me put some over here this one here okay i've actually come to the conclusion that vegan cheese is like not it's actually not good i should have just made like a [ __ ] fruit plate ew like wha who the [ __ ] oh i made a big mistake i'm not gonna lie to y'all oh this one smells actually really good i always see them use preserves so i'm just gonna put the i'm just gonna put that on here i don't have any like little bowls or anything so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna put the whole [ __ ] jar but that kind of ruins the surface level here do i have any little bowls i mean they don't i really don't anyway let's talk about our feelings i woke up at six in the morning and now i'm exhausted but now i'm making a cheese board so it's like my [ __ ] energy is all coming back as i'm making this cheeseboard so that's good news i am exhausted though oh my god this already looks really good this already looks really good guys this is perfect if you guys are throwing a party these are the things i get excited about now that i'm now in my older age a cracker medley how do i make that look pretty though wait why does this this they didn't even have crackers really on plant-based hickory smoked meat we're gonna add that i also have period cramps and they're shooting down my leg it's making it very hard for me to focus oh this is perfect trying to make this look pretty like oh wow y'all i'm about to flex this [ __ ] on my story and my instagram story let's do some nuts definitely not the best thing i've ever done but it's also it's better than i expected okay we're putting all oh my god those olives are so amazing to me oh my god guys these olives are so good oh my god wow got some bread sticks oh wait these are parmesan bread sticks well there went my non-dairy approach okay these are too long oh awesome oh okay i got these dried apricots apricots apricots wait this looks so good guys wait i two oh my god look at this honey i'm mainly really excited to make this pasta i mean this like cheese board was fun and everything and it looks really good and i can't wait to like brag about it be like oh you think you have your life together well check out my [ __ ] cheese board and grow up okay i'm done with my board [Music] how did i do i honestly think i did kind of good before we start making the pasta because obviously that's like the main point of this whole video i do want to try some of these weird scary vegan cheeses this one's a chive flavor it's kind of good but there's something off about it whatever now i'm trying the sun-dried tomato one sun-dried tomato is pretty good last we're trying the mozzarella no why does the mozzarella taste like a campfire no mozzarella is awful why do people put jam on the cheese like why why is there preserves on the cheese board i always see people do that and i don't understand why so today i'm gonna find out why and i'm gonna mix a little bit of that with a little bit of the vegan gouda on i can totally see why that makes sense i feel very exquisite right now now that we're warmed up i feel like now i'm like warmed up enough to try to make this pasta i do kind of want to try this chive cheese again that was oh my god in the olive i don't recommend putting that many olives in your mouth at once i just looked at my cheese board again like i kind of like took my eyes off of it and then i looked back at it and i was like wait a minute she's kind of gorgeous i mean i don't want to be that guy but like she kind of is hot all i did was make a cheese board i didn't even [ __ ] turn on my burner and i already made a complete mess in my home i guess it's time to start on our pasta um spicy rigatoni with a secret ingredient that i can't put on the internet i haven't been cooking in this house yet okay so they told me to turn my heat on low step one easy we should rename cooking with emma to cooking with emma all grown up like before it was like oh so cute emma can't do anything right but now it's like wait emma all grown up maybe she can cook now vegan butter oh this is also vegan so this could make it really gross we'll see do i even have a cutting board have a problem i used my cutting board for the cheese so now for the cheese board so now i'm [ __ ] wait i just realized i don't know how to dice an onion so i do have this mini cutting board what happened come over here oh no i'm gonna start crying oh no my onion nobody's ever been like oh emma it's time for you to chop an onion so like i've never done this how do i do this ow that is the best thumbnail i've ever taken in my life how do you [ __ ] cut an onion there we go oh y'all this looks so bad yo i'm not even kidding like i'm not i really wanted this to be good today but i just don't have the p like how do i cut an onion oh my god literally gordon ramsay would not be okay with this at all i'm [ __ ] crying there are some massive pieces but whatever okay we're throwing this into the pan onion half number one [Music] yum wait look how much better i'm doing oh guys i'm evolving half of this is gonna be like cooked and then the other half won't but whatever three garlic cloves it smells so strong to me i got these pre this is amazing see they're like pre it's awesome oh my god i need to start cooking my pasta i haven't even thought about that if something says to saute does that mean that you need to use oil i mean i guess like because it told me to cook the pepper flakes in the garlic but it didn't tell me to use any oil but i feel like i need oil so i'm just gonna put a little bit in kind of do my own thing here's the garlic awesome oh my god i have two burners on it once and i'm about to start my third guys i am evolving we got this pan going on this pan wait this is bad i feel like this is burning wait i feel really amazing now about myself i've never used more than one burner at once in my entire life salting my water okay this is definitely cooking with emma gone adult version no my [ __ ] stove does this sometimes sometimes my stove just like turns off and starts beeping and it literally just did that and i thought i was gonna lose my mind it told me to saute this garlic and that is what i'm doing but i don't know what sauteing means so let's look up oh my god i'm getting oh my god i have a call right now like a business call [ __ ] this is not real i'm literally mid cooking uh i need to take oh no hi you ready i'm ready i totally forgot that i had a call and so i literally had to just take that and turn off the stove and go outside to make matters worse my connection in my home is so bad the call kept dropping every five seconds i mean it was an experience but i definitely got my adrenaline pumping so i'm feeling that they said to cook my pasta al dente don't know what that means kind of throw on the pasta now throw this in here i feel like i've had like seven different moods throughout this video like i think i started this video and i was kind of in a bad mood uh so sorry about that in advance what if i opened a vegan italian restaurant i wonder if that exists [ __ ] i have to add a secret ingredient that's illegal so give me a second if anybody asks this is water oh [ __ ] i'm making a big mess wait that's a lot of liquid okay i'm supposed to simmer it for 20 minutes if this works though this is like i'm really on my wifey [ __ ] if this works i still am like having flashbacks to when i was cutting that onion i mean i feel sick to my stomach thinking about me cutting that onion you know oh my god that scared the [ __ ] out of me okay so i'm supposed to drain the pasta i'm supposed to save some of the pasta water so let me get some of that okay here's pasta water don't know what that does but okay i'd bring you guys with me but i don't think you care enough about me straining pasta so anyway honestly working with multiple working with multiple burners is like stressful in the beginning but i feel like i like i feel like i kind of took it like a champ it wasn't that bad the thing that i am really upset about though is how many dishes cooking makes this is like i'm gonna be cleaning my kitchen for the next three days okay it's starting to be less soupy it's still really soupy though i'm just gonna trust the process if somebody cooks something for me and i hate it like i can lie and like that's fine but like i don't want other people to feel like they have to lie to me i like being the liar in that situation that's also why i hate giving gifts i don't want somebody to feel like they have to like fake like what i got them that's also why i've always been a very avid user of gift cards also just in case you forgot why don't you look at my cheese board are you kidding i am fully confident that if i made a cheese board everybody would like it so i might start doing that i mean i wouldn't use this vegan cheese again because i feel like this would be if i made this cheese board and everybody was like oh my god awesome cheese board and then they started to dig in and they realized that all the cheese was fake i think they would all start crying i think i'm supposed to add a little bit of the pasta water to the sauce but i don't think it's time yet because the sauce looks like it's literally it's pure liquid right now i'll see you guys when the pasta is done we have a problem the sauce has these big tomato chunks in it my solution and the only one that i can think of is putting it in the blender oh my god that looks so much better i'm gonna play i'll see you in a i'm too overwhelmed goodbye i'm done so i think it's safe to say that this cheese board is [ __ ] flawless as for the pasta it doesn't look as good um i can't stop eating it but i don't know if i like it it tastes nothing nothing like the spicy rigatoni i've had but at the same time i'm kind of enjoying the flavor i mean i ate all of it with the amount of effort i put in i was expecting restaurant quality that's not what i got here this is not something that would be served at a restaurant it's not that good it's not awful but i feel like i could have just used a pre-made pesto or a pre-made sauce oh that's the a pre-made spicy sauce so anyway i'm gonna go dream about this cheese board and not eat any of it because i don't want to ruin it me and my cheese board are gonna go make out in my backyard that's you know what should i say that on the internet me and my cheese board are gonna go elope bye see ya more like i'm gonna be cleaning the kitchen for the next six hours okay bye [Applause] [Music] you

me i'm not even brushing my teeth or doing my skincare yet this is this is the truth of my of my routine i'm not lying to you guys i go immediately downstairs when i wake up oh my god white wait a minute this is my creamer and i guess my refrigerator is on a really cold setting because please listen to this it's it's frozen solid what i remember a few videos ago i was like oh my god i'm gonna start daily vlogging which will never happen i will never daily vlog but what's a little harm in doing a whole daily vlog every once in a while what's crazy to me is i just used to vlog my random days literally vlog me doing [ __ ] nothing and somehow people liked it and then i got in my head about it and i was like there's no way emma that people want to see you driving to a coffee shop editing in it for two hours going getting food and then going home but you know what maybe i'm wrong the first thing i do in the morning well you don't care it's gonna be like the first thing i do in the morning is make a coffee so that i feel really awake throughout the day i'mma shut up okay good news even though my other ones were frozen i do have a not frozen one that is very very hot to me i still can't believe that my [ __ ] creamers are rock solid today is gonna be a little different because i normally don't i normally don't listen i normally don't do anything but i'm vlogging today on a day when i actually have a task that's rare let's talk about it this is where i film my tic tocs does this look familiar so the first thing i do this isn't a tutorial why do i keep like explaining i could just do it oh my god i made a big mistake i'm about to brush my teeth right now with a black hoodie on one false move okay that was annoying time to brush my teeth okay it's time to do my skin care and actually we have some good news this video is sponsored by bliss i've been using bliss's skincare for quite a bit now to try it out make sure i like it i truly love this stuff today i'm going to be talking about their clear genius line basically i went on accutane as you guys know to help with my acne because my acne was really bad and it was hormonal there was no way of like getting rid of it so my dermatologist told me to go and accutane that's fun and all but now that i'm off accutane it's really important for me to maintain my skin and so this is what i've been using the clear genius line has a clarifying gel cleanser clarifying toner and serum a clarifying liquid peel but i don't use this until nighttime so i love their skincare because it's spa quality but also the ingredients are clean so that things aren't harmful to your skin i'll talk more about the specifics at the end of the video but for now i need to wash my face because i need to put on makeup because i'm doing something today okay first i'm gonna use this cleanser i love it because it's nice and gentle but it still does its job it still removes the dirt and oil it still does everything a cleanser supposed to do but it isn't too harsh then i take this clarifying toner and serum i love it because it's like a two in one it does everything that you want it to do all right and then last but not least for my morning routine i keep it really simple last but not least i use moisturizer um this is not a part of the clear genius line but it is still bliss moisturizer and it's great so anyway i'll talk more about bliss later i love their products and thank you guys for sponsoring this video taking this ass back to bed i'm just gonna lay in bed for like the next 20 minutes until my skincare seeps into my face and then i'm gonna do my makeup i normally don't do my makeup in the morning at all um ever but i have two on camera over zoom interviews that are being i guess recorded or something and i don't want to do my makeup for it but i also feel like that i probably should just out of respect for everybody who's going to be on the zoom although i normally go on zooms and i look like [ __ ] so i don't know makeup time god the lighting when i try to film my makeup routine my makeup running like there's like these light strips like i don't understand how to make that go away how do i make this not look like [ __ ] you know what it might just have to look like [ __ ] how's that that's better no it's not since i've been doing a little bit of tanning out in the sun i don't really have to wear as much makeup because my skin just doesn't look bad like it normally does and i don't like to cover my nose because i like to show my freckles because i used to hate my freckles growing up but now i'm starting to learn to love myself honestly when you do things over zoom it's like okay nothing needs to be perfect nobody can actually see what's going on is that even even enough for me i like wish i did interesting things like i don't have hobbies what do i film me doing when i just don't do anything i also don't really cover my under eye bags that much anymore because i also kind of like those too they're genetic i literally have genetic under eye bags and everybody's always like emma you need to sleep and the thing is i've been sleeping for the past like three years and they never went away so like i actually like them now i kind of like don't hate them i'm gonna take this brow gel do my brow real quick my eyebrows are definitely my most neglected part of every routine that i have i just don't do anything to them i'm now gonna take some powder put a little bit under my eyes a little bit on my forehead because literally i have the worst like forehead wrinkles every highlighter it's just the fenty one pretty can't even see it because it's overexposed but not my fault i want to like get into makeup because the other day i like was on a set and i got my makeup done the way that she did my makeup made me look so much cooler than i really am i just look kind of like badass for the first time my whole life and now i want to know how to do what she did to me i'm next to put on this this is a lip plumping lip balm which is funny because people are always like emma you got lip injections and i'm like no i'm literally just using lip plumping um lip balm but thank you guys what else do i need to do i guess just eyelashes when i'm done see makeup routine in under 10 minutes i found that like less makeup is more do you know what i mean like i i really used to like overdo it and i'd put too much product on my face and it was just not working okay makeup is done i'll do a setting spray just for the video because i feel like you guys would appreciate that i don't know if this [ __ ] actually works can somebody who knows about makeup tell me done and i'm not gonna clean up my station is this a mess yes am i going to do anything about it nars here's my finished makeup see this is why it's good to have a simple makeup routine because then it's like i can't [ __ ] this up i'm a little bit stupid i found out that actually the interviews i'm doing today are over the phone and do not require me to be ready so why did i just do my makeup let me make sure am i correct oh my god yeah wow they're just on the phone time to go on to my interviews that i didn't need to do my makeup for joining conference now hello hi hello hi hey everybody my interviews are done very fun but i'm [ __ ] starving so let's go make some breakfast i'm about to make some burnt eggs it's my favorite breakfast last time i made eggs on camera everybody was like emma why the [ __ ] do you burn your eggs and i literally like them crispy like is that such a crunch need cholula two eggs avocado there is a slight problem and it's that my avocados are old like i have had them for a really long time so they might be rotten oh no not good maybe we'll go grocery shopping today although i don't really like that okay this one's fine this one's fine i'll just cut off that little poopy part pee pee poo poo check i salt and pepper the pan before i put my eggs in so that the bottom has i guess this is unnecessary because i could just add salt and pepper after but this is literally what i do every day i feel like i've made 10 videos on my channel i'll be doing this exact daily routine i'm a creature of habit i think it's because i'm a gemini and everybody's always like oh gemini's just do the same thing they don't like change or something okay this avocado feels kind of weird like the texture of it it feels kind of hard i'm kind of scared mmm emma's burnt eggs nothing better than that oh they're burnt i've been trying to drink less coffee every day so i'm not gonna make another coffee yet okay so now put on the everything bagel seasoning take your cholula let's do a little sprinky sprinkles wow delicious cool i'm feeling a little iffy on my day today i don't really know what i want to do i spend like half the day just like trying to figure out what i'm gonna do with my day and then like i never accomplish anything this avocado's actually really good anyway i get self-conscious when people watch me eat so i'm out of here it's really hot out and i am wearing a hoodie this is why i shouldn't live in california because i only feel comfortable in a hoodie yet the temperature going on is not it doesn't work out i think that i want to go to trader joe's because there was a few things i bought for the video i did a video about trader joe's where i taste tested all their stuff i want to go there and i want to start shopping there more because i feel like number one it's good price good environment and i miss it so we're gonna go there but we're also gonna go to this thrift store that's nearby because i heard that they have really good like home decor home accessories i'm not in a huge clothing shopping mood i actually went yesterday should i show you what i got yesterday maybe i'll show you what i got yesterday mini thrift haul when i get home it feels weird driving around and filming it because this has been my forbidden fruit for so long there was nowhere for me to go or know where to film but now now things are changing i'm parking here parallel parky workie parallel parking never gets old it's not the hollywood fix but there's another guy outside there's a little hollywood fix vlog it's not the hollywood fix guy though so i don't know who it is so you wanted to fight dixie maybe i'll start training but probably not i'm pretty lazy okay and my worst fear came true a hollywood fix-esque person found me um i never know how they find you like how did he find me i was so out of my own i was like shaking my hands were shaking not to mention i didn't find anything at the thrift store so like it was just kind of a lose-lose just now but whatever you know what it happens i'm sweating oh that made me so uncomfortable my friends oh my god i was really trying but he really really he really got me okay well let's go to [ __ ] trader joe's now honestly the thing about trader joe's is that it makes me feel so safe there i feel so safe there i can't believe that just happened and i don't understand how he found me part of me just wants to order my groceries online and not go to trader joe's but the thing is is that what we need to remember is that you can't give up when you get uncomfortable i'm now at trader joe's but something funny happened when the camera was off i went to go get gas and guess who followed me there what the [ __ ] anyways um it is 111 which is the time that i always look at my phone so i'm glad that that happened um i'm going into trader joe's now i'll see you guys when i get back maybe we'll do a little grocery haul uh see you guys after well i'll see you in there [Music] actually got my groceries oh it's so hot pita chips these are the best pita chips on the planet these uh cauliflower thins avocado veggie sausage this rice cauliflower bowl just sounds good i've never tried it so it could be shitty we'll find out hummus because i just buy hummus everywhere i go literally four of the everything but the bagel seasoning i also got a bunch of other boring sauces like i got salt and pepper seasonings and then i got this and i think i want to eat now let's give it a whale oh what laurel let's give it a whirl almond butter cup down the hatch oh wow kind of good it's a little bit too sweet though that was my treasure chest haul um i feel like you guys would be mad at me if i didn't make a montage speed it up um fast motion wait what's it called time lapse i feel like you guys would be mad if i didn't make a time lapse of me putting my groceries away so fine i guess i'll do it done you guys want to see what i got i went thrifting yesterday i'm just going to give you guys a quick haul first i got these little athletic shorts super cute whatever then i got this top cute little sailor boys on it and last but not least this is very unique oh very unique it's like sweatshirt material it has like i don't even know what it is i'm actually gonna go um lay in bed for the next probably three hours until i'm hungry again then i will eat and then um maybe i'll exercise or something but no promises so anyway uh i'm so tired for some reason sorry just take taco i actually don't know what just happened i want to use my little cauliflower thins i could make like a little sandwich but i think i'm gonna make pizzas because i think that's more fun um you can't even see what i'm doing so i'll just move them here still can't really see it but whatever okay we're gonna do a little bit of tomato sauce on each oh my god it's like a fun little lunchable okay and then to make it taste extra good you take some pesto for a little bit a little bit then you're taking vegan cheese now this is when my counter is going to become messy and if i wasn't lazy i'd add olives and other toppings but i am lazy so we're not doing that wow easy fun snack and then i put it on bake and then i just bake it then i take it out and then i eat it wow it's not like amazing but it's also like it works ow i need to go to bed now um it is now 7 p.m and i took a nap for like three hours i am so exhausted i am so exhausted i need to feed the cats cat feeding routine check yes my cats do get filtered water you can't even see me right now yummy yummy my tummy fruit salad anyway fruit salad yummy yummy that's what i was saying now that my video is copyrighted um i am gonna go for a run and then come back and do a little ab workout maybe i'll do my ab workout outside no i won't do that i'm really exhausted and like going for a run right now sounds like absolute ass this is not gonna be fun please help me please please i'm back it's time to do an ab workout are you ready this is the craziest thing you're ever going to see watch this oh that's an awful angle this [ __ ] is so boring and i'm i look stupid i don't want to film this anymore done immediately time to get in the shower i feel disgusting i literally because i tanned today for a little bit off camera you guys didn't know about that but this is too lazy to film it also because i like to tan in a state where i if i film that this video would need to belong on a different platform so i couldn't really film it and i didn't really need to talk about it because what's the point talking about if you don't don't show it and guess what i'm doing right now i'm talking about it and i'm not and i didn't show it so it's a point anyway tanned earlier got really sweaty then took a nap while sweaty got more sweaty than exercise and i'm really sweaty so it's like majorly shower time emma chamberlain does shower okay i'm gonna do a crazy transition where i turn around and then i will be done in the shower out of the shower okay time to do a little skincare um i'm going to be using the same bliss cleanser i usually do my skincare outside of the shower because i don't like bringing my skincare stuff into the shower because then i like if for some reason i need to wash my face the next morning and i like didn't shower then i have to go into the shower to get it and it's just like a whole mess now that my face is nice and clean and dry i'm going to be using the clarifying liquid peel this is an overnight pour cleansing treatment you only need to use it a few times a week two to three times per week um i've used it for the past few weeks definitely really clears my skin out honestly the thing for me has been you know i went on accutane to help with my acne something i didn't realize was that acne can still come back after you're done with the treatment and it's still equally as important to take care of your skin these bliss products have really helped me maintain the clear skin and i'm so excited to be working with them because as you guys know i've shared my acne journey throughout all this and i wouldn't be talking about something that i wasn't really excited about i'm genuinely really excited about these products last but not least i'm going to finish off with this uh vitamin c tripeptide collagen protecting and brightening moisturizer also by bliss i also like i just like how simple the skincare routine is i really don't like when i'm using a lot of products it feels so good to finally not have acne this is like the first time in years where i don't have acne and it's so insane because like i've been struggling on and off with it probably since seventh or eighth grade you know it's it's not just been one product it's not just been one thing it's been like finding what works for me and what works for my body and all that and you know for me accutane was that but for maintaining it i've been loving this stuff and i mean i hope that you guys try it out and you love it and that's the end of that but thank you bliss for sponsoring this video okay i honestly i kind of okay i kind of forgot to tell you all the facts about bliss that make it so special it's clinically proven it's dermatologist tested it's vegan it's cruelty free and it's just overall a really clean product which is so important to me because i don't we don't need that extra stuff okay we don't need that extra stuff i've decided that i'm not cooking dinner there's just no way i am ordering it using some hair serums i never used to do any hair products after i'd get out of the shower like i literally give my hair zero attention i like forget it's on my head half the time i look like a [ __ ] psychopath i wish that i had like some cute neighbor team where i was like oh i'm gonna make tea no i'm gonna get into bed and i'm oh did i brush my teeth oh yeah i did i brushed my teeth in the shower i always brush my teeth in the shower and then i always forget like did i brush my teeth in the shower another thing that i do is i spray perfume on me after the shower even if i'm not seeing anyone i'm literally ready for bed that was i i don't waste any time um but we also need to let's [ __ ] be boys for a second watch this blue light should we do a different one like red or like purple my mom told me that i'm not supposed to use blue light because she was like that will create problems with your circadian rhythm don't ask me what that means you know what guys i'm literally going to watch some youtube or tick tock tick tock but i'm going to turn my damn camera off and i'm going to end this video i promise that um i'm going to like get a life soon and like start doing interesting things so that my videos can be more interesting but bad news i have a really hard time finding hobbies to be excited about i'm gonna do a crazy transition i love you all so much you're very very amazing to me it was a kiss on your forehead i hope you leaned in you guys know the drill i'm gonna start doing that maybe i should make that my official outro like hey kissy

-emma chamberlain",2020-08-02T17:45:27Z,328191,5663592,16078,[Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah i use a ring light now it does look really good it's crazy being a youtuber with a youtuber set up i haven't brushed my hair in like two days can you tell [Music] i'm doing something bad today you know what i kind of want to make a coffee let's go downstairs before we start all this we're gonna make a coffee and then we're gonna do what we're gonna do today i am using unreally's chamberlain coffee product right now so sorry that you can't buy it but if you want to buy chamberlain coffee bags chamberlaincoffee.com these are really awesome and i use these a lot but we're testing out new products so i'm using new products but this is still quite amazing now that that's over now we can start i can't talk over this so just be patient listen my life has been actually really good recently i have good people in my life um i've been having fun fun in the sun to be specific because it's summer so life has been like not too bad i mean don't get me wrong i did have like a crying spell last week where i just was crying for like a week straight um about everything good stuff bad stuff nothing at all that's over now life is good to be honest i'm kind of bored i'm not gonna lie i've been definitely really bored i mean i'm filling my time wisely you know what i mean like i'm doing things like going to the beach and going for little jogs around town like i'm doing things but i'm i'm still bored which is why i've decided that i would like to start an internet beef with someone so today we're going to be figuring out who i'm going to start my internet beef with i think it's important for me to like i don't know how this is important i just really want to start beef with somebody actually the truth is i really don't like beef in general i don't like fighting with people i hate drama i hate everything about it but i am still going to make this video and i still am going to start an internet beef this is kind of hypocritical of like my own views on life and like how i live my life i don't i avoid this at all costs but i think that now that i'm in the driver's seat and this is up to me i'm the one that's making the decision to start this beef i think it actually might be fine so cannot [ __ ] wait let's go figure out who i'm gonna start beefing cheers this is like my third coffee of the day but i'm still tired so let's talk about what we have here we have a template i've seen so many people use these templates for videos and it honestly looked so fun to me so i'm going to be ranking who i want to have in internet beef with number one is no beef this just means that i don't want to fight them like i'm not interested it doesn't sound fun to me i don't feel like they would stand a chance and or it just doesn't sound like it'd be an interesting fight second one i'm thinking about it but i'm not gonna do it this is somebody where i know that it could be fun but like maybe there's a risk involved like i don't want to ruin my relationship with this person or i feel like this person is maybe too sensitive to be able to handle an internet beef third is lots of sub tweets but no tag this means i'm tweeting about this person i'm subtweeting them but i'm not tagging them so nobody really knows who the beef is with they just know that there is beef full internet beef with tags this means that i am tweeting about this person i am posting about this person and i'm tagging them this is a full public argument except we just never meet up in person and last but not least we have i want them in the arena i want to have a full fight with this person and i also want to finish off our internet beef with a boxing match let's get into it i'm gonna go out of order i have literally so many different types of people on here youtubers that i like youtubers that i don't know very well youtubers that i whatever celebrities like mainstream celebrities tick talkers like i have many people on here but i'm going to start with pewdiepie because he's the king of youtube the thing is i don't know what i'd fight about with pewdiepie i also don't feel like he's a fighter i feel like he's a lover i also you know he just got married like last year or something i feel like he's kind of in the settling down mode of his life i don't feel like he has the energy to fight i don't think he wants to fight and i also don't feel like he'd roast me hard enough i feel like he'd go easy on me because again like he just got married he's probably gonna have a kid at some point he's probably starting to go into dad mode up here so he's not gonna be like kind of going at it like i want him to so i'm going to put him under i'm thinking about it but i'm not gonna do it next i see david dobrik staring at me i want to fight him i do want an internet beef with david dobrik i do i can't put a finger on why um i know and love david actually but that's exactly why i want to have an internet beef with him i feel like it would be fun because i feel like he's so nice that i feel like i would just write up this like crazy tweet roast one single tear would fall down his face he would respond and he would like try to roast me back but it would be like a compliment he'd be like oh your newborn hurt it literally looks so good i hate you so much i also feel like he might go on live and start crying which i would love to see so david i will be putting you on full internet people tags the thing is i don't want to physically fight david i'm not in the mood david dobrik crying on live is enough for me i don't need to be getting in the rink oh i see denzel dion he's another youtuber i love him i don't want to i don't want to have an internet beef with him though i wouldn't stand a chance i would not stand a chance he is too smart and too quick i feel like i would be the one crying on live no beef with denzel okay well here's cody ko i want to fight him in an arena as well i wanted to start with the subtweets and i want me and cody to be sub tweeting each other like you know just like little jabs then i want to start tagging i want the tweets to start involving tags then i want i want to fully fight cody and arena i know he could roast me pretty bad like i mean we know that cody can roast people right this is like common knowledge and i know that he would roast me really bad on the internet but i want to see if he holds that energy in the arena with me i see ariana grande i'm not excited about it i'm not excited about the idea of it i'm putting her in i'm thinking about it but i'm not gonna do it because would it maybe be fun to fight with her yes but like i just can't imagine what we would fight over like do i say ariana like you sing so much better than me [ __ ] you the whole entire kardashian family i love this i want to get in the arena with them i want to have a full internet be similar with cody i just want to [ __ ] go crazy i don't really want to fight them but at the same time like i just like the fact that there's so many of them and they're such a large family and then me as an only child i feel like it would be a really interesting thing to watch so definitely into the arena with the kardashian family i also want to fight them all at once all six of them at once i actually don't want to do that maybe i do it one at a time actually they can take charts or maybe like two at a time next i see the hollywood fix that's staring at me if you don't know what the hollywood fix is it's a it's like a guy who uh it's a paparazzi kinda anyway i want to fight him in the arena you know why i think it'd be fun because he's very bold about the questions that he asks you know he he asks the hard-hitting questions that nobody wants to answer and he causes some slight discomfort and for that i feel like it would be number one very easy for me to start a beef with him but also number two i feel like it would be fun for the viewers of the hollywood fix to see the man behind the camera in front of the camera in the arena okay next we have nicki minaj lots of sub tweets no tag we all know that nicki minaj has away with her words i think it might be a little bit too humiliating for me to see her say these words to me and have a tag next to it like i think it'd be too mortifying for her to like just write this fire tweet about me i mean i have literally seven words in my vocabulary i literally can't even come close to where she's at i don't want to be tagged in this but i do want to see what she has to say about me miss remy ashton i love watching her cook and stuff like that i think i can definitely start a fight with her though no i can i can't fight her i can't she's too nice in addition i don't want to fight alicia marie either they have their [ __ ] together and i feel like they wouldn't even want to participate in the internet beef because they already have their [ __ ] together they don't have anger that they need to get out next ninja i think full internet beef with tags i feel like ninja is somebody who because he's a gamer he's a streamer i can imagine that he has a system every day where i know that he's gaming a lot every day like i don't want to ruin his day-to-day schedule but yet i still do want to fight him because i played fortnite for two months straight every day for like eight hours i think the most kills i got in a game was like four and i think that i want to fight with him out of jealousy for how good he is at it like i'm almost gonna take out my anger towards the game of fortnite as a whole on ninja because fortnite kind of ruined my life for like two months and even though that's not ninja's fault at all and ninja is just playing the game uh i'm still weirdly angry at him we have curtis danny and true and i'm gonna group them all together because i feel like i want them to be a team i feel like they're all really sweet guys and i don't feel like they would want to fight with me at all i don't feel like they'd want to pick a fight with me at all yet i do want to fight them anyway i'm going to say that we do lots of subtweets but with no tags they know how to roast people but in a really nice way they're going to be really rational about it and because of that i don't want to be tagged in it because i my subtweets are going to be nasty because that's how i play games i don't i don't go half in i go 100 in and i will tweet some some crazy [ __ ] next we have dixie emilio i want to get in the arena with dixie we're like the same age i like her a lot but that's why i think that we should fight because i feel like it'd be fun just as as girls you know i don't even want to do any of the like internet beef or like sub tweets or like instagram lives with dixie i literally just want to get in the ring with her i want everything to be behind the scenes and then randomly i'm like i'm fighting dixie tomorrow pay-per-view fun fact i also thought pay-per-view it's like pay pay per view well i thought it was paper p-a-p-e-r view for my whole life until like a year ago nikkietutorials no i don't want to fight nikkietutorials such an angel i just can't there's certain people like listen i don't want to fight any of these people actually this is all just one big prank but there's some people i can't even joke about fighting them and nikkietutorials is one she's just an angel i feel like and i also want her to do my makeup so like i don't want to create a problem with her at all even as a joke next um skincare by hiram i want to do full internet beef with tags because i already know what we would fight about he makes videos about skin care and i love him and he really doesn't like certain products he also hates makeup wipes a lot and i have literally probably gone through 10 000 packs of makeup wipes throughout my life i don't use them anymore because of him but i used to and i think he would definitely have a lot to say about the amount of makeup wipes i've used in my entire life and i think he would write an amazing paragraph on twitter with tag let's do cole sprouse next i want to do full internet beef no you know what i don't wanna uh no okay so with cool sprouts i'm saying that i'm thinking about it but i'm not gonna do it here's why so i actually saw cole sprouse once in public i was at a restaurant and he was uh at the table next to me i think we might have made eye contact once or twice he was my crush as a kid he was like when he was on sweet life zach and cody he was my childhood crush for like at least a year um so that kind of makes me not want to fight him part of me wants to fight him because of his character in riverdale i don't really want to fight cole sprouse but i want to fight his character in riverdale instead which obviously you know he's acting so it's like not really him i want to fight jughead that's what i'm saying but the reason why i'm not gonna do it is because cole sprouse in real life is very intelligent very college educated very eloquent with his words [ __ ] speaking of being eloquent that's a huge word that i just made just now but anyway he would literally write a twitter thread that's like up to par with like new york times best-selling books and that is why i do not want to fight with him taylor swift uh full internet beef with tags the reason why is because we're both blonde i like i want to just fight her about like oh is your hair really blonde or are you dying it i could make some jokes about like oh you should use some purple shampoo which is actually advice i need to take but anyway i also want her to write a song about me i have a burning desire do you know what okay i just looked at cody in the arena spot he doesn't really belong there cody i don't really want to fight you like physically i no i i mean it could be fun like it could be fun and funny but like i also don't i feel like i need to move you i don't feel like you belong there like you just seem out of place there i feel like i just put you there kind of out of impulse in the beginning because i was like i just want to fight somebody and i actually feel like i just want to put you in full internet beep with tags no but i stand by what i said i'll keep you in the arena okay next we have my favorite youtuber which is his name is the report of the week he does food reviews if you've never watched him please watch his videos he makes me feel so relaxed and calm i'm putting him in no beef i feel like he has not one argumentative bone in his body i don't think this man could literally say one thing that was not a compliment i don't think he could say anything mean i even have his merch next we have casey neistat subtweets i feel like casey could low-key like be a little sassy he's a very sweet guy but i feel like we could definitely have a fun little a little jaby subtweet beef i don't know and then i also feel like he'd make a vlog about it and like talking about it and i think it would be like really fun to watch he inspired me to start vlogging but now we're fighting there's something kind of special about that next harry styles i do want to fight harry styles in the arena this is an unpopular opinion i don't want to fight him because i dislike him and again i don't dislike actually any of these people because i actually don't want internet beef in real life i want to fight harry styles and i want to have an internet beat with harry styles because everybody loves him everybody loves him i've never met one person that's like [ __ ] harry styles have you ever in your life met one person who's like uh i don't like harry styles no i wasn't even a one direction stand growing up i never really listened to one direction i still like like them but i wasn't like a big fan or anything i didn't have posters or anything but like regardless i still can't find a flaw in it i want to fight him because i want to be the one to do it i also feel like he wouldn't even hit me like i feel like we would be doing we would be boxing and like he wouldn't even he would just stand there and he would just be smiling let's do timothy chalamet again i do want to get in the arena with him for the exact same reason as harry styles harry styles and timothy shall may have the same effect on the universe this is why i want to fight timothy chalmay and harry styles the thing is number one obvious reason i i want to go against the grain i want to be different i don't want to be like everybody else and be just like you know so obsessed with them i want to fight them instead but here's the thing if i got into an arena with them i would literally like throw a punch at them and i feel like i feel like they have guardian angels that are around them at all times that would literally block my punch let's do the try guys on youtube there's something about groups of people for me that's very interesting i like the idea of like me as an individual having beef with a group of more than one person full internet beef with tags anyway let's go to beyonce now actually i don't want to beef with her i do feel as though that she has ethereal powers i don't really even feel like she's a real human being i feel like she's just like a hologram on the contrary we have drake i don't want to get in the arena with him i don't feel like it's necessary but i do want to have full internet beef with him with tags and i do want him to write a song about me as well uh i want to start actually with him i want i want rap battle the whole world would get bangers out of it and it would all be because of me and guess who would be the hero me next we have addison ray i'm thinking about it but i'm not going to do it here's why she's so sweet that i don't think i don't think she'd have the heart i don't want to have beef with her but i do the reason why she's not in the no beef category is because i do have this fantasy about us having an internet beef but like it's through dancing it's like a virtual dance battle okay i want me and addison ray to do that on take talk so it's like a virtual dance battle okay and we're like switching back and forth and we like in the comment of our tick tock we'd be like all right your turn dot dot at addison ray and i think that would be [ __ ] awesome next we have mr beast mr b says a lot of money no beef no beef with mr beast he's also very smart i feel like that man is way too smart charlie demilio um listen i kind of want to do the same sort of dance battle thing i am going to put her in no beef because how can you fight her she's just too sweet i i can't i i don't i can't even comprehend even having a fake argument with her i just can't whereas dixie is on the top dixie hit me up for boxing match oh rhett and link red and link were the first youtubers i ever watched which is why i want to have a full internet beef with tags they're very iconic to me because they were i've literally been watching their videos since [ __ ] 2007 or something which is why i do want to have a full fight with them they're so nice and they would never say anything mean but the thing is i don't think i could say anything mean to them either because i owe them my life justin bieber i am thinking about it but i'm not going to do it justin bieber he's married he's married he's doing his own thing i don't want to like get in his business you know what i mean i feel like he's kind of finally starting to settle down he's been through so much in his career that man has been famous for so long i can't even imagine how sick of it he is so he's going in them thinking about it but i'm not gonna do it i'm gonna let him enjoy his marriage and i'm just gonna think about it and not do it last but not least we have jason derulo i want to fight him and that's the end of this video it wasn't easy to decide who i wanted to fight who i didn't want to fight it's like deep down i kind of want to fight everybody but then at the same time i i really want to fight no one uh fighting is not the answer fighting on the internet is definitely not the answer but anyway if you start seeing some crazy subtweets ah alright everybody enjoy your day spread positivity which is exactly the opposite of what i did today because i was because i'm starting internet beef and you guys but you guys don't don't look at me as a inspiration today look at me as just an idiot all right i'm out peace and love everybody all right i'll see you guys [Music] you

-emma chamberlain",2020-07-26T17:32:42Z,286089,5863361,12353,can you believe can you believe this setup right now guys am I am I a real YouTuber oh I'm nervous I have like a good YouTube setup for the first time my entire [ __ ] YouTube life [Music] hi not only do I have a YouTube setup right now but I also am doing a [ __ ] haul I don't know who I am anymore you know what I mean I've done hauls on my channel so this is like not that crazy but I'm excited because a lot of the stores that I've been missing desperately they started opening back up and so I was like I'm on it so I did a big thrifting spray but then bad news all of them just closed in La once again so I'm glad that I went what I did when I say I made up for lost time like I made up for lost time I literally went crazy in these thrift stores I got some stuff off depop too that I'm including in this I don't even remember oh some stuff off Etsy like just a bunch of random thrifted pieces so we're doing a haul I have this crazy setup I let's waste no more time also I got this recently it says Emma Chamberlain sucks uh that is because it's my merch we have sweatpants we have sweat shorts we have a crop top we have a hoodie Lincoln Mayo shop at mychamberlain.com check it out I also have a planner I'm selling it you know what let's just promote everything you can organize your day with me there's also fun activity Pages Link in the description for that too I'm getting into the Hall you guys are probably so annoyed with me right now this is literally the biggest haul I've ever done and we'll be here all night but it's already 10 so God I look at the clock at the same time every single day I look at the clock every single day when it's either 111 to 11 3 11 4 11 5 11 like any time but with 11 and I just looked and there's no less I can't do this anymore I'm really afraid so the first thing I got is this I don't know what it is with me and like clothing that looks like it's a school uniform but I just am really attracted to these things like I can't put a finger on I don't know why I do that this is a vintage Lacoste I don't know if it's real this is the cost on it it's green I love this color this is the color of my couch of my bed frame like I I just can't escape this color it's just so sexy to me next I got another thing in this color are we surprised no it is a sweatshirt material vest it says Polo on it I don't know if it's vintage I mean I guess it is what makes something vintage is it like if it's like over 10 years old like or what's the age what's the eight how old do these things need to be for it to be vintage I don't know I [ __ ] love like anything like any vests like sweater vests vests like I just love them so that was an immediate yes from me and in fact I got another one this is a Nike one um this one's dope ah oh this is a Nike tennis so maybe I'll start playing tennis probably not because I'm really bad at taking up new hobbies so I really don't see that happening but moving on next I got this Oxford University nice old hoodie I just like any like old crew Necker hoodie I like when hoodies and crew necks go up nice and worn in they're just so much softer more comfortable which is actually why I chose this material for my merch because it feels like it's kind of old as we know I didn't go to college so I like to buy College hoodies and sweatshirts and stuff just so that when I'm in public people think that I went to college and don't ask some adults just can't understand that I didn't go to college this is a sex wax zip up has this cool detail on the bottom that I love my dad surfs and I don't surf but I really want to learn and I really want to surf and I want to be a surfer girl so bad I wanted to be a skater girl for a while there but the whole skating thing makes me feel like my teeth are gonna fall out like I feel like I'm gonna fall and eat [ __ ] and my teeth are gonna fall out so kind of like quit the whole skater girl thing I think I'm gonna be Surfer Girl instead and sex wax is surf wax right let's read yeah it's like wax for your surfboard has a cool design smells like [ __ ] though next I got this t-shirt that says Beverly Hills on it just because I liked how it looked honestly and I just like T-shirts because you just can't ever go wrong but I definitely have too many also I live in LA so like Beverly Hills is you know a place that I don't really go often but there's something fun about the energy you know I need to put on music this is so cute this is a nice worn in little crew neck says Hawaii on it I love Hawaii a lot and this gives me very 90s mom who went to Hawaii with their kids and was like you know what this trip was a lot for me I've been The kids have been driving me [ __ ] nuts I'm gonna go get myself a little souvenir she comes back to the hotel room with this and now it's in my closet couldn't be happier it also has stains on it which is always fun whenever you Thrift things like the stains that come with it are so special like I just know that somebody was eating like baby back ribs and like got barbecue sauce on this and like tried to get the stain out and then was like I can't do it I'm giving it to the thrift store and then now I get to have baby back rib stains on my clothes and there's something special about that to me I love this even though I've never been to this place so kind of a fake fan this is a Sydney Australia it's hard to see but little uh mock neck it has this like cool knit detail around the neck area cute little design on the front super soft I've been to Australia once I went to Australia once I went to Mel God I'm gonna say this so wrong and everybody's gonna get mad at me I've been to Melbourne or Melbourne now but it's not my fault like I'm just like really not good with grammar so next I got this like kind of like a sweater vest but also like kind of different because it's not a v-neck I don't know I just like this also I got this from a vintage store and I really like the lady who runs it and she just like does such an amazing job I probably wouldn't have normally bought this but I just loved her I love her so much that I was like I'm going to buy it I feel like this is something I'd wear if I was in New York or something with like a turtleneck under it and just go get brunch or some [ __ ] I got this cute little finally something summery God I feel like this is kind of 90s like I feel like I can picture Britney Spears wearing this which is how I gauge if something is 90s If Britney Spears or Paracel know to worn it it's probably 90s something a little bit more summery for me I actually really struggle with buying summer clothes because I don't really like summer clothes I love summer I love getting tan but when it comes to dressing for summer like I'm at a loss literally today was 100 degrees and I was wearing a sweat set I was wearing this with the matching sweatpants all day and it was literally 100 degrees and I was sweating my ass off but the thing is I don't know how to dress for like 90 degree weather this is gonna help me add to my little summer collection God bless I got these pants these are really interesting I don't tend to wear a lot of tight pants I tend to wear more like looser comfortable pants and these are kind of like tight and more like a serve I guess don't know how I'm gonna wear them I actually kind of forgot I got these so we'll see what I end up doing with them um but I think they're kind of fun and they smell like really bad I got this really cool jacket this one's definitely vintage which is really cool um I could picture like some guy wearing this to his office job on Wall Street in the 70s hey Dad if you're watching this let me know if that's an accurate statement or not I've been looking for a jacket like this for a really long time also I wanted to buy a VIN like a I wanted a thrift one I didn't want to buy a new one and so that one was nice and worn in and there we go this is just like a cute little sweater I mean this is honestly so [ __ ] boring like it literally makes my skin hurt because it's so boring but I just like the material it's like this cute little soft like kind of velvety but like not I like this because I feel like I can just wear it with jeans and it'll be comfortable sometimes you have to buy things that are not that interesting but you know you will go to all the time because they're comfortable this what even is this I literally don't remember again this is very similar like this is so incredibly boring I just know I can wear this with jeans it would never fail me but I really like this I don't know it's just really soft and probably shouldn't rub that on my face oh this is fun this one's really fun again something I cannot wear until winter but I really like it this is [ __ ] incredible this is like me in a sweater I swear to God this is like my dream sweater it smells like [ __ ] but I really like I love this sweater I love when I find things like that at thrift stores because I feel like those things can be really expensive like really complex like patterns and [ __ ] like that obviously when you're thrifting things are not expensive so that was great next I got this this is so painfully boring as well I just like anything with a mock neck I'm just an absolute [ __ ] for anything that's a mock neck cute little navy blue stripes kind of reminds me of something like you know Captain Jack Sparrow would have worn oh these are fun okay so this is like comfy cute shorts right so these are kind of like retroy looking tennis shorts kind of like a little athletic Vibe something that like Lady Diana would have worn you know what I'm talking about those like viral Lady Diana photos that are epic they're like cute but they're also um comfortable and like not super tight like denim shorts that like ride up my [ __ ] and like make me uncomfortable oh my God can you stop like they have to play with the one loud toy like I've given them so many toys and they have to play the loud one right now look at Declan hey hey oh my God okay well that's the cutest thing I've ever seen I guess I can't be mad at him for long I don't know what era this would be I like things that are ugly I think we've been through this before if you if you have watched my other hauls before I buy things that I think are a little bit ugly because I like the challenge of it this is definitely a good example of that like what am I gonna I don't know what I'm gonna do with this but like it's gonna be a fun challenge to try to make it look not as tacky as it is next is another sweater easy to tuck into jeans I think what I just realized is that I just tuck everything into jeans and call it an outfit but I mean what else am I gonna do tuck it into a skirt I guess I could but I don't really like skirts very much to be honest I wore skirt the other day and I was like I don't feel so good this is cute simple I'm happy with it this oh my God I'm so obsessed with this see but the thing that's fun about this is that this will look good by itself but also I could wear this under like a simple crew neck of some sort and then this collar would show through and it's such a beautiful color so this is really cute next I got this this is kind of another thing that I find to be a little bit ugly to be honest like I saw it and I was like that's kind of ugly but I feel like I love I love this green and I love like monotone like I like um not monotone monochrome what does it mean when everything's the same color I don't know but I I like really love this it it is this is like something that I would put on my Pinterest board this is actually kind of not thrifted because this was 30 so that's kind of not it's like a little bit more than normal with thrifting but this is really cute I mean they sewed it so I'll give them credit where it's due next I got this is not vintage this is just thrifted it's this sweater has sailboats on it honestly I got it because it's really soft I also love sailboats because my dad used to sail boats and so it's kind of nostalgic kind of personal I like things like that you know this is this is really cute and just honestly really soft like I wish you guys could feel it oh next I got this little Polo Ralph Lauren is it Lauren or Loren again Dad give me a call after you watch this and let me know how it's pronounced I like the little Christmas colors going on again this green color is obviously a huge pattern for me I just can't get away from it would be cute with like a little collared shirt under it would be cute with sweats for a little morning coffee run because even though I do have a coffee company chairman.com um big things coming soon with that I just ruined any like ounce of excitement anybody could have about that by saying what I just said like I probably just made all of you guys throw up in your mouth even though I have Channel and copy.com and I whatever I still like to go on little morning coffee runs for a little bit of social interaction and to feel like a little less lonely moving on Elvis Presley shirt this is kind of another nostalgic thing because my mom really likes while she I don't know if she still like listens to Elvis but I know she like her celebrity crush I think for a while was Elvis and I remember she told me that a few times when I was a kid so now I like love it I mean and I actually love Elvis too I love his music um and this shirt's just so cool like how cool is this next I got this little USA soccer little crew neck it's nice and worn in already the back is funny because it's like you know you see them from the front on the front and you see them from the back on the back hahaha so funny um this is just so nicely worn in again that's kind of the selling point for me if something just feels really soft and worn in I'm just gonna buy it even if I like kind of don't even like what it is I will probably get it like I don't play soccer and I like Looney Tunes but like not that much I just really like how it feels on my body next oh my God I'm obsessed with this I'm gonna crop this but I haven't cropped it yet so I'll just show it to you as is I got this a few days ago it's a little Gumby I love Gumby he's just so innocent and pure and cute I used to go to this little ice cream shop with my dad and they have this little Gumby sculpture I think it was or maybe it was a painting like a little gold Gumby something and so every time I see Gumby I just feel really safe so I needed this these are some cool Levi's I just like any kind of cool patterned pants to be honest it spices things up I'd wear blue denim every day if I could but sometimes it's nice to switch it up so these are fun nice little statement piece they're Levi's which is like my go-to jeans speaking of blue denim I got a pair of just blue jeans I feel like the things with these is that like they're so hard to come by like the perfect pair of jeans that like anytime I find one that is right like I cannot pass it up because I know that I might not find another pair that fits right for like six months so the denim is in good condition so like they're not gonna rip on me because I okay I just went to the tailor the other day and dropped off five pairs of jeans because they all ripped right in the ass like right here hold on here I don't know if like one of my butt cheeks is bigger than the other one and like rips one side of my jeans like I cannot figure it out these are perfect they're 501s which are my favorite the little button fly going on next I got these I'm not sure how I feel about these I got these on depop they don't really fit exactly how I planned so I'm not a huge fan of them I might end up donating them I'm not sure but I'll show them anyway because I like the patterns patterns kind of fun and unique but they just like fit weird I don't know you'll see maybe they don't fit weird maybe I just was like having a weird day and I just thought that they did two things left guys we really got through this these are fun I do need to cut these really desperately but they look like this they're just like black jeans I don't know what this brand is at all but they're just nice black pants last thing last thing is a pair of overalls I'm like really confident when it comes to like wearing clothes like I'll literally wear anything and like not think twice about it except for overalls like this is something that's very out of my comfort zone but I really like these they look like this they have this cute seam down the side I don't know and I like the little patch on the front like I really like them I just they're so out of my comfort zone and I feel like nervous to wear them but I feel like this could be a good step in the right direction good step in the right direction for me with going out of my style comfort zone so wish me luck on that and we'll see if I actually wear them in public or if I just wear them for an Instagram photo and then run back into my house immediately screaming because that literally happens sometimes there's certain things that I will wear in an Instagram photo that I will not wear in public fun fact about me I actually more thing that I forgot about and it's right here this is the best thing I got so brace yourself Save The Best For Last I don't think you guys are gonna believe this say hello to rubber chicken bag I know you're thinking Emma that's the goofiest thing I've ever seen but I actually think I'm gonna use this at first I just bought it because I was like literally the mere thought of somebody else using this bag and it not being me like I was getting fomo just from thinking about it and I was like there's no way I can let somebody else use this bag it's way too fun so I'm gonna get it so that's all I got everybody I had fun filming this for you guys I love clothes I love sharing clothes with you guys I love watching what you guys buy look up hauls like every day and watch them before bed so this is a pretty Epic Thrift haul I mean it was kind of massive thrifting's a great option it's sustainable you know you're not adding to the trash that producing clothing makes sometimes so if you don't Thrift now you should give it a try depop is great Etsy is great Goodwill all those types of things it's good for the planet it's good for your wallet anyway I love hanging out with you guys today uh sorry my cats are being annoying this will never stop until

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-07-19T17:28:52Z,250326,6421136,13187,hi my way my way or the highway i don't like who i am sometimes [Music] i kind of think that i'm gonna become a vlogger again once quarantine's over maybe i'll become a vlogger like i'll start vlogging more could happen what's up everybody okay these are secret coffee bags oh god i look like [ __ ] these are secret chamberlain coffee flavors that could potentially be coming out anyway i'm making a coffee and then we can get started even though these products aren't out yet chamberlaincoffee.com is what i'm using but you don't know that because the products haven't come out so i could be lying for all you know so this morning i was super bored i decided to just drive around like literally just get in the car to start driving i ended up getting this crazy idea this is another tick tock thing whoa big shocker so basically on tick tock i've been seeing a bunch of people talk about all the different fun foods that they sell at trader joe's if you don't know what trader joe's is then you might not need to watch this video maybe you go watch another one of my videos because this is just going to be stupid and boring then again maybe there's a chance that one day you will go to a trader joe's so maybe you watch this anyway i don't know everything at trader joe's the grocery store is like their own brand or at least 90 of it and they like come up with the craziest stuff i'll give you a sneak peek this is a bag of potato chips that has sea salt vinegar dill ketchup barbecue chips all in it why so they have like some stuff that's like genius and then some stuff that like doesn't make sense but a lot of people are talking about it right now and a lot of people are taste testing it on tick tock and i don't know about youtube but i know for sure on tick tock and i felt like left out so today i was like i'm gonna go to [ __ ] trader joe's and i'm gonna i'm gonna try every single weird or genius thing that trader joe's has trader joe's taste test this is what my channel has come to because i don't have any other ideas comment down below if i should start an internet beef with someone to give me something interesting to do oh my god the coffee's so [ __ ] good chamberlaincoffee.com can be ready as the [ __ ] as the kids say big things are coming it's literally 10 a.m like i this is like my [ __ ] breakfast so there's snacks so things like crackers chips nuts all that stuff and then there's foods that need to be warmed up but we're going to start out with the snacks because it's easier and i'm really not in the mood to cook right now and i never am so first thing we're gonna try this is the patio potato chips it's a mixed bag of sea salt vinegar dale ketchup and barbecue flavored chips all in one bag makes no sense to me so this is not something that's genius to me this is just weird it's almost like they got lazy like they had like extra chips in their like warehouse and they're like let's just put it all into one mixture smells [ __ ] weird absolutely not i'm gonna eat another one though no i'm not i don't like it this is a three out of ten the problem is is that i know i know that there's all those individual flavors so when i eat the chip it's like they're all coming out at me at different angles in my mouth and on my taste buds and it's not pleasant it's like if you're watching a movie and you can tell that the actor is acting so just ruins the experience that's like this it's like i know that there's all these individual flavors mixed together therefore the flavor as one to me makes me want to throw up moving on next thing we're trying is a drink this is jalapeno limeade it's good low-key actually be really fun i'm just going to drink it straight out of the bottle because i live alone that's actually really [ __ ] spicy i don't know if i'd ever drink this again but i mean it's good this is like a six out of ten it just tastes like limeade that's spicy bomba peanut snacks i have no idea what this is like what is that but i love peanut butter so oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] it smells like peanut butter oh my god i've never been more confused in my life you know how like an eggplant okay if you've ever touched an eggplant you know what i'm talking about the like density of it mixed with the weight of it doesn't make sense does that make sense i i the weight of it is weird there's something off about it like its gra sense of gravity is off it's not sweet at all which i was expecting it to be sweet but it's also very under season it feels like you're eating like a hamster and then at the end there's like a peanut aftertaste maybe not a hamster that would actually be like really crunchy i recommend that you buy these from trader joe's just so that you can like experience the confusion that it is they're actually not bad i'm gonna give these a six and a half out of ten because i could see them being addicting because they're not oh really salted or like overly seasoned they're kind of chill as [ __ ] organic dehydrated carrots don't really get the point of this but excited to experience ew it smells bad no i can picture a really hardcore vegan eating these and being like oh yes yes these are so good but not me it tastes like a carrot like it has that like gross kind of earthy carrot flavor that i'm not fond of and the aftertaste in my mouth tastes like a somebody did donuts in their car on my tongue i'm giving this a 3 out of 10. i don't like them you could probably feed them to your toddler because i feel like toddlers probably don't even have taste buds yet if you want to have like a healthy vegan three-year-old baby feed them those and if you are one of those people that likes to eat healthy snacks as a personality trait even when they taste bad again try those so um no not good ghost pepper potato chips i mean i'm just curious to see if this like hurts me i actually ate a ghost pepper once it was not pleasant i actually like spicy food so let's give it a try yeah it's definitely it's definitely oh [ __ ] oh my god they taste really good actually like the initial flavor it's really good but i mean i definitely have a decent tongue burn going on i'm actually gonna give these like a seven and a half out of ten because considering how spicy they are like i would i still want to eat another chip i'm not going to because it's kind of hurting my mouth and i don't want my taste buds to be burned these are chill as [ __ ] the ghost pepper potato chip no although i feel like if i ate one of these right now it would just make all the burning sensation go away because this is that's how weird this flavor is in mild oh my god it actually did help buy these two things together eat a [ __ ] ton of these burn the [ __ ] out of your mouth sorry i'm trying not to cuss as much buy these burn your mouth super bad and then eat these to make the pain go away cornbread crisps so it's like cornbread crackers i just thought that this was so random like i don't okay smells like nothing oh my god how did they do that oh it tastes exactly like cornbread in a crisp eight and a half out of ten imagine you make homemade chili and you put a few of these on top holy [ __ ] that would be so good so i [ __ ] with these sorry i'm trying not to cuss i really like these bagels season everything but the bagel almond and cashews so like nuts that taste like everything bagel seasoning that sounds good to me if i could eat like one thing for the rest of my life it would be a new york bagel everything bagel with cream cheese in it but in new york bagel because bagels here are not as good and then you eat it and then afterwards you're like i really just ate an entire bagel have stomach pain and the bagel wasn't even that good anyway moving on i don't think i'm into this one it's not awful it's not terrible but there's the flavors clash okay because nuts are kind of sweet a little bit and like the everything bagel seasoning is like salty but also has like some onion and garlic and sesame seeds and like it has all these different flavors going on mixed with like the sweetness of the nuts it just clashes five out of ten it's not repulsive on a deserted island would eat these spud crunchy potato snack i don't really know why i got these i just felt like there's something weird about it and they're like freeze-dried french fries or something is that what it is oh my god it looks exactly like a french fry no this is super similar to an in-n-out burger french fry because if you've ever been in and out their french fries are like they're so dry it tastes like a french fry that just got left in the sun for 24 hours three out of ten i just don't i think it's just stupid okay this is upsetting and i don't even want to try it dried okra i don't even think i've ever eaten okra in general so eating it dried is probably gonna be super unpleasant it smells like grass or something no no no i don't like the texture at all okra has a very thin skin around it and then it has all the seeds inside the thin skin is kind of sharp like when they dried it it got sharp so there's like shards of it in your mouth when you're chewing it not pleasant i like pretty much nothing about it i'm gonna give that a two out of ten not into that last snack time flies when you're having fun huh guys love hanging out with you i have a headache pickle flavored popcorn i personally really like pickles god it really smells like a pickle oh my god ew they really nailed the pickle flavor but i don't really think i'd ever eat this again i mean it's kind of addicting actually 6.8 out of 10 no that's not right that's not right yeah um seven point 7.0 7.0 on that one i would rather have like a different flavor like it's just like i wouldn't choose it again but they did nail the pickle flavor the execution was great like it tastes exactly like a [ __ ] pickle um tastes exactly like a pickle a lot of these snacks are just kind of unnecessary definitely fun to try you know i mean it never hurts right i think that i'm now due to have a party at my house um invite all my buddies over all my hundreds of buddies i'm gonna invite everybody over and be like hey guys fun snack taste test trader joe's has so many good like normal snacks that like i don't know why they feel the need to like do these things but i mean regardless i had a good time trying them but we're not done we're not even remotely done we're now gonna have to cook ah i don't wanna cook [ __ ] i really don't wanna cook one of the things that i saw on take talk that everybody was talking about was this vegan mac and cheese that comes in this container it's really easy to make so i think that that's why everybody is obsessed with it because it's just like super easy all you do is you literally just take off the top take off the top pierce some holes in it that's it uh while my mac and cheese is warming up i'm going to try their viral again salad dressings they put these salad dressings in these things um i got two flavors i got almond butter turmeric salad dressing which sounds absolutely awful and then um vegan caesar dressing so we're going to try these dressings while my microwave macaroni is warming up the way that i'm about to try these dressings is probably going to make some of you vomit at home this is how i'm going to try i'm going to take a piece of lettuce and i'm gonna dip it in it then i'm gonna eat it this is the vegan caesar let's check it out wow this is [ __ ] amazing this is a 9 out of 10. i don't know why it comes in a bottle like this i mean it looks like a [ __ ] cold pressed juice but it tastes really good so now we're trying the almond butter turmeric i don't know about this this sounds a little bit too health food-y for me but trying it you know what this is actually good too both nine out of ten this one's not as good but i still like it now it's time to try the mac and cheese that everybody on tiktok talks about vegan mac and cheese that everybody on tiktok likes tests i don't like it actually i don't think it's good tick tock lied to me i'm giving this like a 5 out of 10 because it had a lot of hype around it and i don't think it's that good the sauce kind of has a weird consistency it's like too thin i don't like it and like the flavor it's not really that cheap it's like kind of cheesy but it's like under seasoned god everybody really hyped that [ __ ] up i was so excited um not for me next we're trying this hummus this doesn't require cooking so i don't know why i thought it did dill pickle hummus getting out my pita chip i don't even eat pita chips i don't know why or how i have these but don't pickle hummus down the hatch no i mean okay here's the thing i don't like pickles enough and i like hummus too much for this to happen i'm giving this a 5 out of 10. like i just can't find a reason for it to make sense but if i was at a party and somebody had it they're like a birthday party you know and like everybody was like ah gather underneath the dough pickle hummus i'd eat it but moving on chocolate hummus this makes me want to vomit i'm putting it on a chip which is probably not what i'm supposed to do but wow this is good okay it doesn't taste like hummus at all it has no chickpea flavor this is actually really good and it's it's good because it has like fiber in it no not really actually i would recommend this i'm gonna give this a nine out of ten cause it's really impressive it tastes like nutella or something wow trader joe's i need a break i'm getting really full i also want to try this mac and cheese again just to make sure i hate it it's not it's not pleasant the mac and cheese this is not good next thing i just got because it just it i wanted i was curious about what it meant mini cheesecake cones oh [ __ ] that looks really good oh my god i'm like tearing up i'm literally like i this is [ __ ] delicious oh my gosh oh my gosh yeah i don't give a [ __ ] where you live i don't care if you live literally i don't know where they where they don't have trader joe's but i don't care find a trader joe's i don't care if you have to get on a damn plane this is the best thing i've ever eaten in my life there's like the outside coating they describe it as almond florentine cones but it like has this like butterscotch undertone oh the [ __ ] filling is incredible this should be illegal these are the best things i've ever eaten in my life trader joe's i know i've been giving y'all [ __ ] about your weird random products and this is definitely kind of random but like so good oh my god 11 out of 10. that [ __ ] is crazy that was awesome i feel like a different person now okay we have a few things left these things all require cooking so i'm in for a i'm in for a treat should i just cook everything and then come back that's what i'm gonna do i won't put you all through this [ __ ] brb i made a decision while i'm cooking the remainder of the things that i need to cook i thought i would hang out with you guys so let me fill you in on my life i think i've just been so bored that i'm like kind of getting into like weird things very into conspiracy theories right now not going to talk about them because i feel like i will get kidnapped and killed if i do talk about it but i'm really into all of that and like really into like all of those weird tech talks that are like or things on the internet that are like there's an awaken and emotional awakening and if you see these numbers it means something well let me tell you i've been seeing the same numbers on the clock or like okay even just since i started filming this video it says how long i've been recording and i know i'm gonna sound crazy right now but i've been seeing the same numbers i see eleven like whether it's like one eleven two eleven three eleven four eleven five eleven eleven eleven a lot of eleven and i keep [ __ ] seeing them and i wanna just ignore it but like i can't anymore and even when i was filming this i looked up multiple times at the clock on accident and one of the times it said 11 11 and then one of the other times it said 17 11 or something i'm either gonna like die soon or like something good is gonna happen i know for a fact that something will burn like at some point like one of these things will burn i'm cooking one two three four i'm cooking four things at once cooking up a stem storm in here shut the [ __ ] up hey all my two friends any of y'all wanna come over i have spicy chips and pizza crust made out of broccoli it's actually time to try another product so okay yay next thing we're trying cauliflower thins these are a delicious and versatile bread substitute i actually ended up making a little mini pizza on it it's not terrible it has absolutely no flavor whatsoever which is kind of nice it works like i did randomly just eat the whole thing it kind of grew on me i kind of like it cauliflower things eight and a half out of ten not [ __ ] bad next thing we're trying is very upsetting to me jicama wraps jicama is like some weird vegetable or something trader joe's is stating that you can use it as a taco shell i would love to believe that this is like cold and wet i just warmed up some black beans which i am going to pour onto it these are such good black beans god and then i'm going to put a little bit of vegan cheese on it a little taco jicama i just don't see this being good no no i don't know how the [ __ ] this is possible just by looking at this it's not very appealing but it's kind of like really good i'm gonna give those like a nine out of ten low-key like that was actually really pleasant somehow i just like i bought this and i was like i know i'm gonna hate this i actually liked it so jicama wraps out of 10. we have two more foods left to eat cauliflower and kale pizza crust and then kale gnocchi and cauliflower yoshi i'm so full i feel like i'm going to [ __ ] explode these last three products are the ones that i'm honestly the most excited for so um i'm gonna go take a nap while this is cooking actually don't do that that's not smart because then if the house caught on fire i'm not gonna take a nap but i'm gonna go lay on my couch they don't feel so good okay i cooked i made the pizza and i made the gnocchi and we're gonna give it a taste i feel ill let's try the last few things okay so first we're gonna try this broccoli and kale pizza crust i am not excited about this i do feel like it's going to be gross i do like cauliflower crust though but i just feel like broccoli is such like a strong flavor that i feel like this there's no way this is going to be good you know what wow i mean the texture's a little off but that's kind of expected because it's made out of broccoli and kale like what do you expect but it's actually good broccoli and kale pizza crust from trader joe's i'm gonna give it a 9.5 out of 10. there's no fiber in it i was gonna say i was like this is good because there's more fiber in it there's literally zero grams of fiber i don't even feel like there's a lot of kale in it i feel like this is kind of a scam i'm gonna give it a nine out of ten now because i thought that it was gonna be like you know oh you get your fiber in you know but there's literally no fiber in it and now we have our last our last one this is the one that i see everybody talking about on tick tock the cauliflower gnocchi and the kale gnocchi i don't really see as many people talking about the kale one but i combined them all into one bowl because it was the same cooking time and i'm lazy so first i'm gonna try the cauliflower one okay there's something chewy about it i know that you can cook these on a frying pan and i see people usually doing that so maybe i should have done that because i boiled these the flavor of it is good um so i'm gonna give it you know i'm gonna give it a six out of ten because everybody hypes it up so much like i expected it to be the best thing i've ever eaten in my life and it just wasn't really that not awful uh i think if i would have cooked it differently it could have been better so maybe i'll try that again later in the week but definitely not now because i need to lay down last thing we're trying is the kale one i know i'm gonna hate this and i hate it like it it's leaving like weird little it left like little pieces of kale in my mouth that i'm still trying to swallow um giving that five out of ten i don't like it the texture's not good i feel like maybe again if i saute it on a pan it might be better but i just didn't i just it just didn't click for me moral the story is there is no more of the story i don't know what you guys got out of this i don't even know what i got out of it to be honest i'm probably gonna go lay in bed and wonder like why the [ __ ] i did this for the next few hours but then i'm gonna remember this is what this is something i wanted to do and that's um it's a moral do things because you want to do it um hope you're having an amazing week i love you all and i'm gonna go lay down love you all all right i'm out of here whoa please try the cheesecake cone thing that shows fire you

-emma chamberlain",2020-07-12T18:34:48Z,333651,7273618,13474,come downstairs come downstairs with me we need to have a talk I don't even care if this lighting is good or bad okay and it's awful how about here well [Music] god this is the most random place in my house to be sitting this is like my [ __ ] cat gate for the cats so that they want to like block them out of a space it's actually it's been here for like months and I haven't used it so I should probably put it somewhere else here's a happy I ordered jeans I mean I ordered a lot of stuff during quarantine that I didn't need obviously right now you know we can't go in and try things on to make sure that they're perfect before we purchase them but we're kind of just shooting in the dark shooting blanks or whatever shooting into the shooting into the door we're kind of shooting into the dog is that what it is I ordered jeans we're just super excited but we have some bad news I liked every pair of jeans I got except for one pair I'm just not a huge fan of the wash suppose like no problem I'll just go return that well I can't return that um but there's a little bit more bad news and it's actually that I accidentally ordered two pairs of the same pants and they could not return either of that so I had an idea I'm not the most like creative patient person when it comes to art I leave that to my father Chandler paintings I kind of want to customize my jeans crazy not really but I am gonna take these pairs of jeans and I'm gonna kind of revamp them I'm actually gonna show you them before so that you kind of can see like what they look like and then you can see you know what I mean the big revamp so let me show you what equipment I have purchased a bunch of fabric paint this is gonna be really fun but also very scary fabric markers in white probably black dye and then this light color fixative that I guess makes it so that the color stays better I got some sponges cuz I read online that that's helpful when you're dying and then I got some buckets step number one is we're dying a pair of these pants so we should probably get into that because that's gonna take a long time I hope that what you learn from this video is that something can be really sad and really bum you out and it's all about what you do with it right because I was really bummed out that I bought these jeans and I didn't like them but now I might have potentially or potentially not but we'll take the risk I might have a cool new pair of pants that are custom made one-of-a-kind by yours truly so it's all about the spirit let's get into it bad news so I just read the directions I'm okay listen I am so sorry I am so [ __ ] lazy like when it comes to these things so I'm really starting to question if I should just paint all over these pants instead of dyeing them because listen no complicated wear rubber gloves that already that step I don't really want to go get the gloves from wherever they are I don't even know if I have any shake well before using all right that one's done add hot water to a plastic bucket stainless steel or stainless steel pot ideally water temperature should be a 140 degrees how am I supposed to know how am I supposed to know Kazan you're 40 degrees am I supposed to [ __ ] get a thermometer like I don't have that add one teaspoon of liquid dish detergent add one cup of salt died back for cotton at one cup a big vinegar I don't even have these things should I just like do it wrong no I'm not gonna give up I want to but I want so it says to add a cup of salt why I'm putting my hair up I need to like get down and dirty here so this bucket is absolutely too small I'm not gonna measure anything because I don't have the patience for that so I'm just gonna wing it probably good a little bit dish so I don't know why the [ __ ] they would want back but okay so I'm just taking this black dye Oh eyeball it let's see so it says every pun of fabric three gallons of hot water god I don't know that's a lot of dye so we're just gonna start putting the jeans inside some of it might spill out but yeah it did I fully submerge the jeans it already looks different which is actually very exciting watch this work I never like doing DIY project into work but I feel like today could be the day so I'm pretty pumped about this so we'll just leave her in here see this is why I sabotage myself because I'm like oh look it's just two water Oh like when you know I want to do something I always I'm like oh it's too hard I can't do that and then I do it in like two minutes later like it's it's done and I'm like oh while those jeans are dying I'm gonna start painting my jeans my other jeans I don't know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna wing it I'm gonna wing it but because I don't really like the wash of the jeans I think I need to do something like a big almost like a big mural to cover up the color that I don't like okay so I'm nervous because I know that like if I [ __ ] this up like I kind of have one chance to do this right I'm on my period and I just bled into my pants I think so okay I saw a bunch of inspo photos and I feel like what I kind of want to do with this is like almost make it like just like one big doodle like crazy colors a statement piece although that is kind of scary because then I won't be able to wear them as much because if they're like a statement piece then I can't really wear them you know what else I could do ah I saw this one design online that was like a bunch of smiley faces down one leg I kind of like the smiley faces God first first one here No aah oh my god this is so terrifying this isn't as scary as I thought it's actually kind of going well what if I just drew shapes all over my pants I need to make up my damn mind that's for sure I am gonna do smiling faces all over the pants happy faces and then on the other side I do sad faces guys how [ __ ] awesome in imaginative of that anyway while I'm doing this we can talk about life and all that so basically I've been waking up really early for some reason I don't know what's going on with me I don't know like who hurt me but I've been waking up at literally 6 a.m. and then like I try to go back to sleep because I'm like that's not really good think it's not there's no reason for me to be up this early but then I end up like just staying up and then I'm like up really early and I don't know what to do with myself so it's kind of nice though because it's weird when you wake up early because then you realize like wow my house looks so different at this hour like I should start doing yoga considering my new hour of wake up Julie these could actually look really cool guys if you have an old pair of jeans that you're caught it just kind of made the decision for me as to where the that circle is gonna go but anyway if you have a pair of jeans where you're like god I don't know what to do with these like I'm not I'm not feeling them anymore I don't like the wash whatever give him a little revamp paint him see what happens so tick tock today I'm like for you Paige of somebody saying that they saw me one time out and about in that they saw me pick a vagina wedgie mm-hmm but I wanted to talk about the emotional effects it's been having on me I don't feel like this I just don't know if I picture this happening but the last like this person said that it data and therefore I guess I have to believe them I'm very disappointed in myself again I don't know like I really wish I could have seen a video or something - if you have the video and you're watching this please don't post it I don't want to know actually send it over to me it's like not what I was expecting when I when I gone on take up this morning but but a lot of school actually that's kind of good guys i'ma not being negative about something that she created so once in her whole life Wow you know like them with just circles like not smiling faces like I kind of like just the circles Scott I'm already getting paint all over myself which is not good because this stuff stains cuz it's poor fabric so good news um what if I just painted like the whole leg one color no that would look that ma would it I'm thinking that I like take the yellow and I brush it it's all so easy like this is easy to do yeah kind of like giving it like this like oh that actually looks kind of good does it look good though scary and I do feel like I might regret it but okay I mean it's kind of cool I'm actually kind of impressed like they look like something that like some like [ __ ] high beast would wear and it would be like really expensive I kind of regret doing the polka dots now maybe I do turn them into smiley faces you know what this will take this to the next level one down I'm already regretting my decision I think what I'm realizing is that I'm just not very good at drawing smiley faces so actually I think I'm gonna try to wipe them off it's almost like it never happened the smiley face is never happy I'm gonna go set these outside to dry so I can work on the back but for now they're unique so it's time for us to take our jeans out of the dye they look good I guess I mean I don't know what they're supposed to look like but he's a super off topic but I want to tell you story I've been seeing all this stuff on tape talk about this magic shaving powder and that really interested me because I hate shaving and I love magic I ordered this [ __ ] it literally looks like it's vintage and I tried it yesterday and I'm here to tell you that it didn't work for me although I think I might have done it wrong everybody says that the product is great so I kind of believe them over myself I tend to [ __ ] these things up look this is pretty insane they're black now oh I was like I don't know how I'm gonna get these into the [ __ ] washing machine because they're dripping but then I realized it's called being handy I'm on my period in a bad way right now I'll talk about it in this segment it's not good No I am so frustrated I just got black dye all over everything well seeing oh my god same day I'm also bleeding into my pants I'm gonna take a break from all this I'm absolutely beside myself just stress but I'm gonna lay in bed for a while until all these things are done and I will I'll see you on the flip so I just put on the pants and I need to figure out where I'm gonna cut them cuz they're way too long first I'm gonna look in the mirror because I want to see how much I like the design I did oh I'm gonna cut them and I'll be back I'm gonna cut them with no pants on which is why I'm not gonna show it I'm just gonna take them off cut them and then put them back on so I don't want to you to see my [ __ ] so much better now they're cut they're very I do think the backs a little bit boring so I think we should paint the back some with something and then I think we'll be done I kind of hate them but I like them better than I did before so some of you at home are probably cringing right now just being like Emma what the [ __ ] did you do why'd you do that I don't know like do not have an answer for you would I buy these if I saw them at the store that is a question I don't have an answer to right now I think if both sides were like this then yes I would purchase from the store but because we also have this polkadot side I'm feeling a lot of pain throughout my body before I make any more decisions I'm gonna style these pants and see if I can do it and if I can style them successfully and like it looks cool I will leave them and if not I'm gonna need to reroute baby results are in I don't think these pants are working I think the problem is I'm looking at them they are like kind of cool they are kind of cool god am i okay can I leave them I actually like them I've decided I like them I'm gonna keep them as is I will do better on my next pair I have another pair don't I think I would I need to like spend like 20 minutes in my bed just like thinking about what I did and whether or not I like it so see ya I've made the decision that I actually like them my other jeans just finished in the washer and they're about to make the bimini me sound watch being a Mimi I swear to god it's gonna happen there is let's see how these look interesting I have no idea what color these are gonna look like once they're done in the dryer so next pants are in the dryer we'll work on those when they're done for now I you know what I realized about these pants if [ __ ] one of those like streetwear brands that like everybody's obsessed with if one of those sold these pants no one would question it but because I made it I'm like this looks like a [ __ ] toddler painted on it which is exactly what it looks like but I think that that can work if nobody knows that I made them sadly I will be posting this on the Internet where everybody is gonna know that I made them so it's gonna be like the kind of illusion is gonna be gone although I am gonna post a picture on my story in them beforehand and see if I get any compliments we'll keep you updated on that and we'll see it when it's time to work on the next pair peace out jeans number two or out of the dryer I don't know what I'm gonna do with these I definitely don't think I want to do something as bold as this other pair because um I did maybe possibly ruin a perfectly fine pair of jeans although I already wore them and I posted them on my Instagram story to see what people would say about them and I did get some responses I'll read what some people were saying before we even touch these I am like still like so hyper focused on these number one somebody said what is on your pants sad sign that is not really what I was going for next comment said I love the jeans alright so some people like it next said oMG are your dream jeans thrifted or can I find them somewhere I'm in love with them that's a good sign another one did you paint those pants that's not what I was going for I did not want people to know that I painted them myself I am feeling as though the coconuts may be going away but they did have a little cute moment I think with this pair I'm gonna do nothing on the front and just draw on the pockets I'm gonna take what I know here okay I really like I really like this kind of like this like rough paint look not only do I like how it looks but it was also extremely easy so what I'm thinking is I'm just gonna do on the back of the pants all over except for on the pockets so the end then on the front I'm just gonna leave them normal or maybe I do the front am I gonna have another indecisive meltdown right now I cannot believe this I think I'm gonna do the pockets in the front like red that could be cool oh that looks cool it's really surprisingly easy and fun so feel free to try this at home guys I'm gonna finish these and then I'll come back because you don't need to see me do this whole thing again it's just not worth your time I'm done painting I'm done I've decided that I'm done big changes have been made first I'm gonna show you my yellow pair I have officially transformed them I'll give you a close-up basically I added some darker yellow or yellow ocher if you're in the art community - the brighter yellow and I'm calling these my van Gogh pants kind of gives me the sunflower painting energy so I'm excited about those I don't know if the paint's gonna be super stiff because I literally put six layers of paint on those pants so hopefully the paint is flexible we will soon find out look at my hands god I'm a true artist runs in the family Chamberlain paintings if you're watching this hope you enjoy but we also have this these are scary to me these are gonna be called my period pants it basically looks like black jeans with period blood all over them I think that they actually could look really cool on I really do feel like this is something I would buy from like a trendy little New York boutique to be honest like I do feel like I would buy these they are slightly frightening but I'm excited to try them on tomorrow and see what they look like so I'm gonna play for tonight and disappear into my bed for the rest of the day and tomorrow we're gonna try these pants on style them and see how I did great news it's actually the same day I'm so excited I just put together two outfits with the jeans I think the jeans might be absolutely really ugly so let's see let's see big reveal we'll read them out of ten we'll see how I did I'm nervous but whatever guys van Gogh inspired so like they're perfect for the pin I'm really happy right now I don't think I've ever done something creative it's not hated it I'm giving these a 10 out of 10 you will see me wearing these optic these are a 10 a 10 god bless feeling amazing right now let's see the other one again two in a row I did it I did it I transformed my pants from pants that I would never wear to pants that are now cool pieces in my closet that I would definitely pull from that I love and you know what this just made me feel so happy and good here's what I'm gonna tell you in this life you know sometimes shitty things happen you order two pairs of jeans you're so excited you don't like that you can't return them there's two options call the manager or you could paint your jeans and that's a metaphor that I want you to take with you today Emma not being negative I don't know doesn't happen a lot I have no artistic ability okay and I did this and they turned out [ __ ] cool so do what you want with that info I'm really [ __ ] excited this is gonna inspire me right now I want to like start making my own clothes not like sewing or anything anyway what a fun day what a great moment I hope you guys enjoyed hanging out with me making these jeans if you guys try this out and like try to paint your own jeans or whatever and do it similar to how I did it or not whatever let me know send me photos I'm really curious to see if other people do this oh god you've had fun verse I'm God I'm no it is literally allergies but it does look like I'm crying uh or maybe I am or maybe I'm not I don't actually don't know if I'm crying her and I literally can't tell so I'm just gonna blame it on allergies anyway that was really fun I love you guys thank you for always being the people that I can come to and try new things with I love you all so much you're all very beautiful and awesome and have the best day and um oh yeah my tongue is kind of not looking its best I don't think that looks so good [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-07-05T18:52:38Z,159480,2753476,8793,hey we're know how to start a video I literally just don't have a sort of video it's always awkward I'm so excited as a kid I was a massive gamer that might come as a shock to some of you but I was a massive gamer I'm talking Club Penguin I'm talking a toontown I'm talking poptropica I'm talking disney games like you know the disney games like there was like disney games PBS KIDS game Slenderman every app in the App Store [ __ ] Temple Run [ __ ] doodle jump I played every game as a kid I think that's why I grew up and now I like fortnight although my fortnight days are over and I talked about fortnight too much and now I'm sick of it it was funny in the beginning cuz it was like my new hobby and then I just got so sick of [ __ ] talking about so we will not be talking about fortnight anymore I that phase is over and that's just another one of those phases for me I have these crazy phases I get so obsessed with something it just becomes my passion and then um you know week later I'm over in for example plums I had this whole plum phase and it was I was so passionate about plums I literally made March about it I also have a bug bite on my hand that i edged until it is now bleeding I also have heat rash on my arms where all the story is I'm like disintegrating so here's what we're doing today today I'm going to be playing the games I used to play as a kid because honestly it just sounds fun to me so let's get into it a lot of the games that I used to play are not available for example I know toontown is cancelled same with Club Penguin which breaks my little heart I know that there's a new version of toontown it's called toontown rewritten and it's somebody like a fan of the game made a remake of it that exists so we're gonna try to play that today I need a login I don't remember my login if this works I'm gonna [ __ ] lose it oh my god I think it works my hair is so dirty you can tell by the way that it's like coming up on this like wow this is not healthy I'm not even updating you guys I'm not even telling you guys what's going on I actually already have the like new version of toontown in my computer I don't know when I downloaded it but I have it I didn't even have to download it so while it's it's loading I'm actually going to pee and I will see you guys oh [ __ ] I checked in the wrong password do you hear that sound I'm in no [ __ ] way guys this is [ __ ] crazy this is crazy oh my god this is so nostalgic free so if you guys are unfamiliar with toontown which if you are I'm literally so sorry cuz your childhood must have been so awful basically tune down is this game where you kill these robots what no no cancel you kill robots how do I explain this I don't know oh my god this used to be my favorite [ __ ] game as a kid this was my favorite one yes to kill the robots you have to play games to get jelly beans you have to earn jelly beans that's the currency in the game so you can get you don't care look at my name bubbles glitter toon oh you [ __ ] [ __ ] he just pushed me out of the way yo I'm gonna start playing this is my new fortnight this might be my new thing I might start playing this [ __ ] again no awesome okay so now I have weapons let's good do some stuff let's go [ __ ] [ __ ] up I need more help you know like my health is at 2 out of 29 right now I'm not doing good I don't remember how to get my health up like do I just chill and then just wait for it to go I think I have to actually do things do I need to Google this right now how to get my health up in toontown cuz that would be [ __ ] sad I love this game what's in here oh this is the [ __ ] racetrack you think I have enough [ __ ] jellybeans to get a race car right now Yeah right I need to spend at least a week on here oh wait can i no there's nobody here to race so I can't even race anybody I'm so sick of this I hate it here should I like talk to this person's weight oh my God look at my [ __ ] house it's so ugly it's going though oh look how bad the graphics are look out that window look at this little sitting area it's like so cute I actually love those chairs and would literally buy them in real life look at them they're really cute and like the little rug kind of mid-century modern but like mixed with like something like East Coast's like East Coast cottage vibe who's Dave can I go in let's rate the furniture in here first we have this couch that is the stripes the stripes I'm gonna write this piece of furniture six out of ten I like it I just feel like actually no I'll give it a 7 9 10 I kind of like it next I'm gonna raid the chair of the chair next to it definitely a three out of ten that pattern is absolutely atrocious next we have this little chest here I'll give it a three out of ten it's really boring nothing special about it next time to get these chairs in 8 out of 10 because I have them and obviously he copied me I'm out you know the whole nerd kant's Oh should I join in look at this an owie rather cool Oh what the [ __ ] rude oh my god somebody else is joining look we got the whole gang going on you know I'm just gonna throw in a cupcake oh my god look we got the whole squad in here oh my God look there's so many people oh my god everybody wants to [ __ ] it oh my god everybody's hanging up oh my god everybody's [ __ ] hanging out and having fun look at us we're all just having fun and hanging out just just [ __ ] just like squad Shing oh look at his [ __ ] bending over in unison just dodging his exploding parts I'm not gonna lie I might start playing this game and look at us dancing and [ __ ] to like doing a little take talk dance in unison we would have gotten at least a million likes on that if we would have if we would have done that on ticked uh I wanted to join the gang right there but that wasn't an option hi Shay become her friend yo hey Stella want to come join me over here with this dude hopefully somebody joins me oh my god look I still got a whole gang on uh yeah it's crazy I mean doing things like that will make it so that I never get married oh my god somebody just threw one thing and he just destroyed none of us even had to do anything I just threw up a little bit don't mind me just defeating him [ __ ] yo I can't hang out I'm too busy defeating cogs okay I think I'm actually done playing toontown that was in fact fun and I think we can all agree on that how do you quit so I'm gonna raid toontown in eight out of ten did it live up to my expectations yes it did it was actually really fun it's normally more fun when you like really get into it it's a chill game it's something that you spend a few hours on and like you know you get some tuned tasks and you complete those tasks and then you get the rewards and still it's fun it's good vibes it's just good vibes to me like I feel like it makes me feel good it's nostalgic I remember Sunday mornings for me eating s'mores pop-tarts and playing [ __ ] tune down and just living my absolute most bestest lay let's get into our next game guys I just found out some crazy news they've created a Club Penguin rewritten let's go penguin named awesome ping Pengy oh my god this is awesome this looks exactly like it I don't even know what to do I don't even know I don't even know how to play this anymore I don't even how do I walk how do I walk oh my god oh my god oh my god where do I go ah ah I don't know what was the point of this game again I guess you just play games I think the pizza shop one was one of my favorites basically the goal of this is that you're just trying to make the pizza order pretty [ __ ] self-explanatory I used to get oh my god so when I Swizz is a kid it's like things would knock on my way on this game I would literally like I would actually get like physically angry physically angry like at a dangerous level so you're [ __ ] intense this is sorry I keep cussing see how intense that is no no no no I'm not gonna make it I'm not gonna make it No okay I don't know why anybody would want to get five fish on their pizza but I guess penguins are a little bit different two three four what other games are there to play oh I used to love this one this just made me realize how [ __ ] good I wasn't playing games like I used to know all the tricks like oh like that like we oh I may be it's muscle memory because I don't know how the [ __ ] I remember to do that oh [ __ ] backflip only oh [ __ ] this looks exactly a Club Penguin I'm freaked out you're actually doing pretty well although all these people are in my [ __ ] way and I can't see anything in my way I need to stop cussing I'm really trying damn it oh my god wait there's a band playing no way what's your band name anyone hello can I join the band of course how do you get an instrument I'll be backup dancer oh my god what is going on oh my god I love this hair wait look at this cool western shirt awesome low key that shirts kind of fire what's this little phone oh my god I forgot about this oh my god I forgot about this oh my god I forgot about this I really don't know how this works I oh my god wait I did good oh my god I did good yeah we are person sucks in comparison to me watch this damn it dude me oh my god this person might win no watch this little stupid idiot huh yep lights oh I just want I think this one I think I just one I think it is one thing today's wind you know why I probably one probably because I'm playing in seven-year-olds and I am almost 20 so I go fishing this game is actually quite boring oh [ __ ] whoa chill came over yeah maybe because you [ __ ] out an Amazon ad at the top of the game and I clicked it on accident and guess whose [ __ ] fault that is not mine I'm done with Club Penguin okay the last game that we're gonna be playing is a little bit more intense a chapstick really bad um anyways I will be playing slender man I am scared it's on the phone though it's not it's free on the phone whereas on the computer you have to pay like $10 for it so I think the way that this game works is that you need to find like signs like I guess like pieces of paper oh you are now the haunted good good I remember used to actually freak me out like this game actually freaked me out although there's no sound and I think the sound kind of made it more scary oh god there it was I got a gold house is actually kind of cute I wasn't really like I know that this weather and the game is supposed to be scary but I actually really love fog like this mmm delicious this games actually super boring too I used to play boring games as a kid like cuz I guess my brain was probably not as developed so like it didn't need as much to like stimulate it oh there he was right there here wait you know what maybe this is kind of scary actually I did gotta frighten me a little bit I just like [ __ ] walked towards him a little [ __ ] get over here you little [ __ ] I don't [ __ ] care I'm not scared of you oh there he is let's see what he does to me ah he kill me I don't know Slenderman was okay like kind of boring I feel like it would have been worse if I had sound and I could have heard the sound of the game oh yeah I'm just not Slenderman didn't do it for me I kind of feel like I need to play one more game I just laid on my heating pad for like two hours actually was only for like an hour it felt so good bye we have one more game I don't have my webkinz login anymore I completely forgot it so I had to wait for my friend to send me her login she still has her so let's see if it works yeah this is Adobe Flash Player is blocked okay I've figured it out okay we're in this website looks like it was literally created 17 years ago it probably was actually created let's see when webkinz was created okay webkinz was created 15 years ago 2005 does not feel like it was 15 years ago that is really really upsetting okay so let's figure out what to do this is like the one game that I actually have no I completely forgot out of this one word I do remember this welcome to the curio shop I'm going to gem hunt let's try out this one I found some jaded Envy Chams stupid what's magical forest what is this game I hate it here kins ville Academy this was my favorite I think look how complicated this looks let's reminds me my website

the wheel of woe I remember the sound whoa did I not tell you I don't remember what the point of this is I guess you get a prize congratulations you've won a goo goo berry ice cream Cup what is that and I remember how this one works and this is actually harder than I thought oh this one's hard I'm really hungry right now guys what should I use I spend like six hours a day trying to like figure out what to eat oh one try left like I'm like you know sometimes I want to order something maybe sometimes I want to make something I mean recently I've been making love I've got a toast and a lot of

before right peace out here oh my god no way I hope that wait a minute story [ __ ] time so on webkinz they have these music videos right and there was one of them that was like my favorite song oh my god I found it oh my god I found it okay hey it was called I got a lot of soft spots for you and I had a crush on this kid in elementary school and I used to listen to this song and think about him in my living room I would dance her on my living room singing this song and think about this kid I had a crush on I'm not gonna say his name because that's so [ __ ] embarrassing but let's hear it [Music] um let's move on Fitz no way oh my god how cute him ha oh my god spots I'm putting him in a cowboy outfit oh my God look how cute he is oh my [ __ ] god look how cute he is I'm gonna give him

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-06-28T17:07:57Z,436205,6301526,18817,my gardener is here and he is watching me [ __ ] i'm uncomfortable [Music] hi everybody today's a big day i know i look oily it's because i just moisturize my face so you can relax um it's not that big of a deal also my ac is on in the car which means that you probably can't even hear anything i'm saying can i just get out of my driveway and then we can talk be patient with mommy be patient with mommy okay here's what's going on i'm so nervous i'm so nervous right now i'm driving to a hair appointment and am i getting my hair cut no am i getting my hair colored yes because that's really the only other option if you're going to a hair appointment i'm going back to blonde now this might not be that crazy for you but i want to explain why this is so crazy for me when i first started my youtube channel i was blonde okay i had this whole face um as a kid where i just like wanted to be blonde so bad and i literally tried to get to my ideal shade of blonde for years and it never happened it just like every time i'd get my hair done it just didn't work out i'm crying because this doesn't last me personally at all so then i ended up going brown and then i've kind of been brown slash dark brown ever since and then i went blonde underneath and like you know all of it's been fun or whatever but i've decided that i'm gonna try again is this the decision i really want to make like i wanted to dye my hair dark green for like at least two weeks luckily i didn't do that oh my god i'm being stirred up i could just cover my face okay i'm covering my face going blonde is very impulsive but i want to do it because i think it would be fun for summer and why not just like damage the [ __ ] out of my hair sounds fun in other news i do want to fill you in on me what's going on with me i wanted to tell you about something that happened today so basically i have a guest bathroom in my house and i decided to use my guest bathroom instead of my bathroom today just to kind of switch up things let's try something new i guess i was in the mood to try something new so i go into my guest bathroom and i decide to go to the bathroom in there now i don't want to tmi you guys i started peeing in this bathroom and then things went south and and then you know some other stuff happened you know besides besides urine you know what i'm saying i don't need to say it and i you know was done in the bathroom i can't believe i'm talking about this after i was done on the potty i realized that there was no toilet paper now mind you this was not just like i didn't just pee you know and i lean over to look into the cabinet next to the toilet to see if there was anything in there that could help me nothing it was it was bad the only thing that i could find was a face mask a sheet mask for your skin your skin here though not for your skin there and so moral stories i wipe my ass with a face mask today anyway my ass actually is burning like i'm not lying to you my ass is burning i think it had menthol or something in it i don't know if they do that or maybe tea tree oil or something of that sort well it's now on my [ __ ] and it is burning so my day is going i'm excited to take you along for the rest of it supposedly this hair appointment is going to take me about five hours so i'm just gonna be sitting in a chair for five hours and i'm not excited but i also am excited because the end result is gonna be hella cute that's basically that i i will see you guys when i want to see you again blonde emma is coming back i never thought that this would happen i really i really really really really never thought that this would happen and i'm just as shocked as all of you um i really truly believe that my blonde days were over and i was never gonna do that again but alas it's been six hours six hours i'm covering the screen right now because i don't want you guys to see me because it's a surprise it's been six hours my hair is finally done it's actually much lighter than i was expecting but i think i really like it but i'm really scared to say okay bye oh my god i can't [ __ ] believe it i cannot believe it y'all this is [ __ ] crazy do we like it or do we hate it i'm really scared i'm freaking i'm not upset i'm not upset i like it i'm scared of what others will think of it basically i didn't eat for seven hours and i'm [ __ ] starving for one i also don't know how to get home what a [ __ ] day y'all i'm blonde now oh my god that's a [ __ ] one-way blonde i'm blonde i'm one i feel like draco malfoy i feel like doing crazy [ __ ] with my hair makes me feel really good and i can't really put a finger on it and why i also feel like i'm really pale right now which probably is making this look worse i'm scared to get people's reactions i don't think anyone's gonna really care that much so that's good news oh my god okay you know what can we just talk when i get home i'm like really like emotionally unstable hi chamberlaincoffee.com day two of being a blonde this is still so weird i just wanted to talk about it and just hang out um with you guys while i cook my breakfast today oh my god how weird how weird is this so far all my friends have said that it looks good they're probably lying because they feel bad for me but i'll just take the compliment and move on it's so weird being blonde again i literally i can't believe it i cannot believe it i wanted to share my new breakfast routine with you guys because i've been really enjoying it and i thought that we could have fun and enjoy it together first thing you need two eggs now you need an irva curto you know what's so funny is that i i used to be so like i thought sorry i used to think avocados were like the grossest thing ever but now i think that they're delicious this avocado might be rotten so let's find out together three two one big you're kidding that's a beautiful cotto right there i won't ever say that again you know i'm excited to see like how this blonde is gonna look when i get fully dressed because i haven't like been fully dressed with it yet like i've just been no makeup and chilling so it's gonna be really interesting to see how it looks see what it looks like in action well you can click off if you don't wanna see it um i won't be hurt okay so i like to season the pan before i put the eggs in i don't know what that does or if it does anything at all crispy awesome okay so basically there's this thing in the egg that i hate it's like this weird little i don't know what it is it's like weird little white thing and it really really grosses me out so i take that out and then i break the yolk and then i spread it around put a little bit of oil around the edge yes i am a good cook everybody relax anyway then i wash my fork because i don't want to get salmonella pork is clean then we season the egg there's something really awesome about cooking it just makes me feel good it makes me feel like really productive and like an adult and all that i don't think i ever finished what i was saying about me hating avocados i mean all i was gonna say was oh [ __ ] oil just hurt me i used to hate them and they were so disgusting and now i think they're god's gift and i eat avocado like seven times a day which might not even be healthy i like to cook my eggs a lot like burnt okay so we need to talk about how i'm gonna style how am i gonna like change my style now that i'm blonde or like should i like kind of start dressing a little bit differently and i mean i don't know what do you guys think i feel like this is gonna change how my outfits look i feel like i kind of want to give myself a whole makeover just change everything about me now that my hair is different that might be a little bit irrational but i think i have like little identity crisis sometimes and every time i dye my hair it kind of makes me have another one so i think that's kind of what i'm going through right now but anyways on a different note we'll handle that when i get dressed today but i need to share with you this everything bagel seasoning that i've been using it makes everything you eat tastes like an everything bagel and i'm not gonna lie to you i think it's the best thing i've ever even if you don't like the flavor of a burnt egg i think that you can appreciate the beauty in what i've just made it looks very gorgeous to me a ton of that everywhere [Music] we're all good somebody's dropped off a package nothing to fear here anyways i'm just gonna take a bite of this i don't think i can eat this on camera because it's too [ __ ] messy wow oh so [ __ ] good anyway when i'm done eating this i put too much hot sauce we'll see how the blonde hair looks in action i'm really excited a little bit nervous but excited hi okay i did my makeup i really think i like the blonde it's growing on me it's been freaking me out it's been freaking me out a little bit like it this is just such a big change and like you know it's been kind of uh making me feel weird but i feel like now that i have my makeup on and you know whatever i'm seeing it for what it is and i'm looking in a mirror right now and i think i really like it so let's pick out a little outfit for the day i'm not going anywhere today but kind of thinking i just got these orange dickies and i feel like the orange with the you know i feel like that could look kind of cool so i want to pick out like two outfits and see which one i like better brown could low-key look really cool now yeah i'm gonna do something with this brown shirt maybe i wear that with the dickies fit or maybe i don't got a little white top okay that's one cute outfit i don't know how to pick out outfits anymore because because i haven't had to in so long that it seems i've forgotten how to do that i could wear these pants these cute little white corduroys pants with the brown top god i don't know maybe this denim vest all right i'm gonna put these outfits on and see how i look all together with my new blonde hair i like the new hair with an outfit i feel like the blonde hair it's kind of like an accessory i really like my hair everybody who's been wanting to go blonde this is your sign from me like just send it let's try on another outfit though and see let's try on the other outfit i picked out let's see if the hair can like hold up in any outfit like maybe i just got lucky this time but like let's see if this is more than just luck like let's see if this hair is versatile and if i can use it well i don't have a choice because it's on my head but the results are in and the blonde does match everything okay now i can sleep at night although i feel like i like the other outfit better because now i feel like i don't know i want to be a little bit more crazy with my outfits now when i'm blonde you know do something a little different this is fun this is really fun i'm gonna sit down ew there's cat litter in my bed awesome well um that's the end of this video i hope you guys enjoyed hanging out with me and coming with me on my hair color changing journey kind of [ __ ] with it so i don't really see it going anywhere anytime soon but yeah that's all i got for y'all today uh enjoy the rest of your day or evening or morning or whatever the [ __ ] and i'll see you guys on the flip give this video a thumbs up

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-05-10T22:09:19Z,315706,6555022,11536,hi guys before the video starts I just wanted to have a little heart are I've been feeling so grateful that during these times I'm able to come on here and be myself and have an escape I hope that YouTube has been the same for you and as a part of me saying thank you to you guys into just the world in general I'm gonna be donating part of the revenue from this video to feeding America if you guys would also like to donate link is in the description I'm thinking of you all I hope you're all staying safe and healthy and taking care of your mind enjoy the video listen know what I'm doing tonight I've never been more excited for video in my entire life you get closer to me let's get a little bit intimate I have a lot of things in the back of me I just built a bookshelf you can see it right there it's yellow um so there's garbage everywhere everything's a mess but all of my burritos are here and I need to tell you what I'm doing since I was a young child my favorite food has been burritos I eat burritos a lot quite frequently and I thought that it would only make sense for me to try all of the fast food burritos and tell you the best one this is the ultimate burrito taste test I chose mainly fast food so that like this could be useful information for you because like there's a lot of great burrito places in LA but they're only in LA so like how is that helpful for you these are chains that you can probably get and I'm just gonna tell you like what's the best you're out and about you want a burrito you're in like a new place or something and you need to choose well I'm gonna be your guide your tour guide so let's just get right into it I have literally so many I don't know where to start first we're gonna try we're gonna try talk about I've never had a Taco Bell burrito I've heard a lot about them but I've never eaten to talk about burrito I don't think I got to for some reason I think they had two flavors so I don't know which ones which so we're just gonna try all these are vegetarian burritos okay okay considering the price this is a black bean rice cheese green salsa burrito considering the price I'm pretty impressed it's pretty good umm the tortilla is very chewy a little bit too chewy for my liking but the black beans have a lot of flavor there's not a lot of filling it's a very skinny burrito feels like a little bit like limp but it tastes pretty good I mean I'm gonna give it a 6 out of 10 cuz it is good it's not bad it's just I'm not like super excited about it this is a six out of ten I understand the talking about height but I think that I if you're gonna go there maybe dunk in a burrito or maybe this is really good and maybe I'm just an [ __ ] I mean I do hip eating it moving on to our second Taco Bell burritos this one looks different I'm scared of it I kind of want to rip it in half oh this one has like red sauce in it I think this is the exact same burrito but just with red sauce in it no no this is a beans she's in salsa burrito I hate it they literally put nothing in it they put no filling this is just a tortilla with like one being in it and giving this one a three out of ten I think that the rice added something with other burrito and I just fingered this freedom and it made me upset overall rating for talked about them to give them I'm gonna give them a 5 out of 10 I would never seek it out I don't think it's that exciting I think there's a lot more potential with burritos and I just don't feel like those made me feel something and I'm just here to feel something I've never eaten here in my life El Pollo Loco never eaten this in my life apoyo loco already is serving it up we get two kinds of salsa with the burrito that's this burrito looks a little bit more full like this is like has some passim it has more it has a larger circumference I'll boil over let's see it the tortilla is very doughy and like stretchy and it kind of tastes like it has a very flowery taste like you can taste the flour and it has eaten rice off my table and you guys saw me do that it's really embarrassing I'm not super excited about it this salsa is really nice so this green sauce is really good the rice is kind of dry the beans are kind of like boring flavor I feel like the flavor in the natural burrito itself there's no flavor this salsa though makes up for it and that's why it's not that bad I'm gonna try for my final review it's just super underseasoned it has like no seasoning at all really really boring I'm gonna give this a four out of ten I would've given it a three out of ten but it does have a nice circumference and it has a good salsa so oh boy I love them I don't know four out of ten we're just getting started I'm gonna be so full at the end of this next we're going to Del Taco literally have never been to a Del Taco in my life the only thing I know about it is the [ __ ] vine that everybody quotes that nobody shuts up about and it's so annoying like I wish people would just stop talking about that del taco meme it's not funny anymore it never was funny this burrito is weird it's like open on the top that kind of confuses me but whatever I'm just trying to get straight to the filling I don't want to mess with the tortilla on the top okay let's figure out what salsa we're gonna use there's this one is medium heat this one's original heat whatever that means it doesn't really give me a gauge of how spicy it is original medium and hot I think that I need to do medium because I'm not in the mood to burn off my taste buds del taco let's see what see what's up I can't believe I'm about to say what I'm about to say if you know the type you know the del taco behind the vine is a girl reading a sign that says fresh avocado but she reads it in a certain way free shabak adieu this actually has free shovel could do in it like so I'm shocked cuz I didn't even I was when I used to watch that vine I didn't think about the fact that she was talking about the fact that Del Taco has reached Siobhan could do they actually do it I'm really impressed um the burrito itself is kind of boring it's just kind of bland per usual I feel like all these are just really bland and boring but there is really good fresh avocado in here like no joke del taco you do have fresh avocado and I'm sorry then I ever doubted it when I watched the vine they did not seasoned the beans enough the beans just taste like beans I don't know how beans are grown I probably should be googling that I feel like this is what a bean would taste like if you just took it straight off of the bean plant and ate it it just does no seasoning at all the cheese is kind of gross the beans are a little bit bitter you know one beans are a little bit bitter that's what's going on here and I don't like that so taco I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you four and a half out ten because you actually have fresh avocado and that's really impressive and I have not seen that anywhere else with our other competitors I really really appreciate the fresh avocados it's really hard to say fresher avocado and knock but the vine but I would never do that to myself are you moving on Baja Fresh never eating here either so I got it came with chips okay we'll try it I got two tacos from Baja Fresh this one is bean and cheese this one's vegetable let's try the vegetable one first so far the Baja Fresh packaging is like really nice like look it like comes in this thing and you can take it out the presentation is great this is a nice big burrito PAH fresh this might be the best Brina I've had yet today the burrito itself is really well executed they did a good job but I don't really know what I'm what I can complain about but I also like don't love it but I think it's just because there's too many vegetables in it and I just don't think that is my thing I'm gonna give this burrito is seven out of ten for what it is not because I really like it that much but because I know that they did a good job and they paid attention to detail the seasoning is there the effort is there I appreciate it now we're gonna try Baja Fresh it's bean and cheese I will be eating burritos for the next week I'm literally gonna freeze these and reheat them so that I have food for the next week how smart is that it's like meal prep mm-hmm this is a seven and a half I understand this is a really good burrito the seasoning is there the tortilla is a great flavor it's a great size it doesn't blow my mind that's why it doesn't get like a ten out of ten it's all the best thing I've ever eaten I don't know fresh you did really good I'm gonna give you a seven and a half out of ten in total I think that you guys did a great job and I feel like Bob brush is actually a great burrito optioning in a pinch I still have three burritos left I might need to take a break sorry I don't feel good I don't feel good I've eaten a lot of burrito in a very short amount of time I feel nauseous I feel sick I don't want to do this anymore I'm not feeling good my stomach is making sound I've never heard it maybe in my entire life it's really painful there's something going on in my body but I'm going to keep going because I am really deep down actually kind of I hate to admit it but I am having we're trying to pull a next I've never had a burrito from Chipotle I've only had their bowls but I do like Chipotle their burritos are huge this is this is a nine out of ten this has brown rice black beans vegan meat cheese that's it this is a great burrito wow this is like the first one I'm excited to like eat later for dinner the other ones not that excited to eat those but I will I really like this burrito nine out of ten to go way mm-hmm when it comes to a fast food burrito I don't really think that anybody can do better than Chipotle moving on I decided to throw in a local burrito I don't think that this place is a chain it's called Takaya they're like a health food Mexican place and this burrito is like $15 which is kind of stupid this burrito is very stiff but that's also probably because it's like healthy virgin maybe what to say I don't know what it's sorry I like the fact that this burrito is like a healthier version the flavor compared to like Chipotle it's just not as good but it does have vegan cheese which is nice because now I'm not gonna get diarrhea from this one I'll be getting diarrhea from all of those instead but when I'm sitting on the toilet considering everything up here I'm gonna know that it's not from this burrito that I appreciate what even is that it's a stem of some sort I don't like that pisses me off I'm gonna give Takaya a six and a half out of ten no it's seven out of ten because it does taste good I would probably eat it again it's not like a situation where I can't put it down holy braid over here could not put it down I mean it's also not seasoned badly although the tortilla does taste kind of burnt it kind of bothered me like it tasted burnt in my mouth like I've had this burnt flavor in my mouth it was not pleasant normally like burnt things but I don't like the burnt tortilla from here sorry took my last burrito this is from the local taqueria I kind of wanted to try something that's like less fast booty and more like you know it doesn't come with salsa oh yeah it does oh my god and chips oh my god best chips we've had yet I got two burritos from here depend off the video veggie burrito and a bean and cheese I need to literally lay down after this video I'm I feel ill it hurts oh my god this burrito looks so good let's do it no way oh my god this is so good this is so [ __ ] good this is it head out hang this is a veggie burrito it has a bunch of vegetables in it which I normally normally hate not right now this is so good there's [ __ ] avocado in it all these different vegetables every flavor is right like there's not one thing in this it's like a misplaced or wrong like everything about it is so good you need to go to this place I don't know what it's even called Elza rapping it's so good this just made me I'm never eating a fast food read oh yeah you get everything if this is what this is what it I don't ever want it I will never I'm never doing that again I'm gonna try the bean and cheese see if it's the same energy that's the way to go the tortilla is amazing its soft its flavorful but not too flavorful not flavorful in the wrong way every single filling is perfect it all blends together in this perfect way you're not thinking about like oh this one element of its weird no so good it is so good I'm like triggered about how good it is I need to take a nap I now feel ill from this experience but it was really fun um and I hope that you guys enjoyed it they are still my favorite food and they forever will be my favorite food I love being a food critic I love being a food critic I love being the voice for fast food things although this video basically just said never eat a fast food burrito thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed I'm really really okay that's weird I feel like somebody's breaking into my house but whatever thank you guys for watching thank you guys for coming along on this food journey with me it was I'm really uncomfortable I'm in a lot of pain my stomach hurts follow your dreams be yourself hope you guys are keeping it real and I love you all peace and love I love you guys didn't make coffee yet today because I ran out of coffee and I don't know what to do so I'm really emotionally unstable sorry if

sorry mom I love you but I really don't like this outfit it would look cute on her than me it looks like she just went onto Urban Outfitters and screenshotted the first off that she found I just don't like it but I love you mom I do moving on my mom also sent me this I like this better I just hate the sandals but this outfits better I really like this woman's pants I think this could be fun last hop in my mom sent me was this which I also don't really want so sorry mom it'll be fun though maybe I'll try on outfits in Atlanta beat something I like next we have my dad's outfits for me which I think are a little bit more up my alley or she sent me this photo of Gwen Stefani I think that's who that is might be Christina Aguilera I don't know I was born in 2001 I've no gauge of culture she looks amazing I love this outfit very 90s maybe might be it's probably 90s next this love that love every single one of these women's outfits I don't know what era maybe that's 80s I don't know I don't really care I just like outfits and then last but not least he sent me this kind of like a little skater vibe I'm be trying on my parents outfits that they want me to meet you anyway that's what I'm doing today um I feel like I'm slurring my words because I'm so tired let's go try on outfits okay so now I need to assemble the outfits first we're doing this one let's see if I have everything to that this is a similar black top it's just some kind of wide leg stretchy pant I don't have anything like that so I'm have to get creative here you don't know if I own something like that I'm sorry mom I must have something like that wait yes yes these are kind of wide leg like that perfect and then last but not least these shoes that I despise they're like white platform I don't know if I'm gonna be able to pull this one off I can't go shopping right I have to pull with one pull from what I had these platform Air Force Ones these are quite different but I mean maybe that works she's not gonna be happy mommy oh I still call me Mom mommy and that just came out on camera and now this is gonna stay in the video and now I'm gonna be embarrassed anyways [ __ ] it mommy I don't really like those shoes and those are the only ones I have that are similar so sorry about it but this is what we're dealing with moving on next how it is this one I think I have perfect pants for this yes perfect perfect next I need a tube top I actually personally really do not like tube tops I feel like they don't look good on me um a tall tube top she's a green sweater around her this is the closest green sweater I could find now I need to find sandals like that and I just don't own that actually oh my god I have these it's close enough this is like as close as we're gonna get last but not least we have this outfit this is a full denim bodysuit I don't own that actually I keep discovering things wait a damn minute and I gave it to Goodwill [ __ ] every time I get rid of clothes I'm like I'm gonna regret this and then I do I found these overalls yeah that I'm never gonna wear otherwise so what shoes they're like white platform shoes I have these these are white platform shoes I just looked at the clock and I've been literally picking out outfits for six minutes but it feels is that I've been picking out outfits for two hours I am losing my [ __ ] when I tell you that I'm losing it do not take it as a joke and do not take it lightly because I'm actually losing my mind like whenever I'm confused in the fashion world like whenever I'm fashionably confused I just throw a turtleneck under it and this is my next outfit this is probably my favorite thank you Dad for sending this over I'm obsessed with it I feel like this is kind of a similar vibe and then it looks like she's wearing some Dickies like a kind of Dickies vibe with the cheetah Belle and I'm pretty sure I have a cheetah bell away I had up all of these clothes that were perfect for this and then I gave them all away I feel like these Dickies they're like kind of a darker describe this color there's no like shoes in the photos I'm just gonna wing that part whatever oh we know I need that fuzzy jacket her jacket was quite funky I don't know if I have anything like that I mean I have this [ __ ] it I'm using it let's talk about something I just caught myself saying the f-word we need to talk about how I need to stop cussing it's a bad habit and somebody needs to stop me moving on now we're gonna do these outfits kind of gonna combine them first we need jeans jeans that I want her in my laundry hamper and I don't want to take everything out I'm taking it all out wait they're not even in the hamper where are they then they [ __ ] they've gone missing see look at me I just cussed again they [ __ ] who's gonna stop me you know when dogs like bark sometimes there's like a leash that will like slightly buzz them a little bit which is kind of [ __ ] up and I would never get one of those but beside the point I need one of those for cussing Oh perfect now I need a black belt right here perfect now I need a black turtleneck that will be hard to find in here done oh they're rain creeper is kind of everyone hates these everybody makes fun of me for these and I love them if you're one of the people that makes fun of me for wearing these I'm over it you're not hurting my feelings because I like them next should I recreate two of these outfits cuz they're just so good I'm gonna do both more than one who's gonna stop me hey we have the top it's like black zip-up it's not gonna look the same but whatever I even have the leather pants I have the leather faux leather faux leather pants perfect but shoes is she wearing oh I kinda have shoes like that too what do you think thumbnail I'm losing my mind that's what I Oh Lisa's my dad's kind of skater outfit that's what you described it as anyway a hat this is the closest thing I have so this will have to work Dickies can do that vans I don't even know if I own vans anymore and then a windbreaker I must have why don't you guys say hi to Frankie do not go in there mommy needs to go in there he's gonna give me the same vibe as vans actually that doesn't really match the maybe I'll wear these that's kind of cool and now I'm finding the windbreaker but I don't think I have something like that I do have this though do you think that works y'all a mite done picking out my outfits might be time to do the big reveal see what my parents whipped up maybe I could start making them like maybe they could be my stylist I'm also gonna do this hat and stand with this outfit not that you care you'll see that later but maybe this experience will allow me to hire my parents as my stylist full-time could be a fun bonding opportunity for us let's see what they did I actually don't hate this outfit it's kind of 6 out of 10 kind of simple it's not really something I probably wear again but like I also don't hate it as much as I thought I would and I appreciate that you send me the outfit in the first place so overall it's about a 6 out of 10 it's kind of cute my mom and I definitely have very different styles though so I don't know if we would ever agree when it comes to clothes but I think that this is still cute and I really appreciate her effort moving on it's just so unlike anything but it is cute see I call my mom mommy still and I'm not afraid to a minute I am a little bit afraid to a minute I actually think this outfits cute I um would have never picked it out but I'm actually gonna give this one a 7 out of 10 because it shocked me because I actually like how it looks better than I expected these are pieces I just would've never paired together and I feel like it's opening my mind and so 7 out of 10 because it's cute even though it's not something I would normally wear it's still cute like especially shoes I never wear sandals of anyway in any way shape or form sorry for judging you and telling you I hated it kind of made it my own but I kind of liked it okay I'm shocked I kind of switched up this outfit a little bit because I didn't have what I needed to make this outfit and completely accurate but I really like I kind of like this I'm gonna get this in eight and a half out of ten I really like this outfit I think it's actually really cool and it's never something I would have put together so this video is really good for me I'm really evolving a knife out of ten I really like this I'm sorry for judging you I'm sorry for judging your outfits your outfits all of them impressed me times are getting into my dad's outfits but mom overall review I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you an 8 out of 10 because we have very different styles but you still impressed me because once I tried them on I actually think I understand what you were going for and I really liked it so thank you for participating mother love you time to draw my dad okay I mean it's not that bad I love how it looks on Gwen Stefani or Christina Aguilera who everybody I love how it looks on her I just sit down at the right equipment I really love the outfit I'm gonna get the outfit itself I'm nine and a half out of ten I'm gonna give my recreation a two out of ten it just doesn't make sense it's not terrible but I just didn't have the right I just didn't have the means I learned that word like a week ago and I've been using it ever since they just say like the means like I don't have the means to do that like I just keep saying that dad I'm really sorry to disappoint you I appreciate the opposite over I just didn't to recreate it properly and for that I am sorry but better luck in the next three outfits I think that we can maybe come back and do better but we will see [Music] I love this 10 out of 10 I love it it's just the perfect it's a perfect outfit for me I love this outfit dad can I hit my recreation tena Jen love this outfit obsessed with this outfit I probably won this before that's probably why I like it so much because I probably want this at least once I know what we're all thinking Emma this outfits so cute what's going on with this top listen I don't have a top that like perfectly resembles her top so I did this just in the meantime so we can get the idea because I didn't execute it properly it's hard for me to know like what it would look like in its full form but I'm gonna give it eight and a half out of ten because I really like it I love the energy I love the vibe of it dad you did it again this is a great outfit it is kind of boring though I'm making this one a nine out of ten eight not eight out I really like it I don't know if I would wear it especially with the hat we thought the Hat for sure I would wear it with the hat I just don't know but like the rest of that outfit neck down I'm [ __ ] with it dad this is it actually this is like it'd be like three out of ten this is the last outfit that makes me sad I was having fun should I have them send me more outfits maybe that's for another day like for not too that's it that's the video I look really really not tan right now that is because I cannot tan because I will burn I hope you guys enjoyed this video special shout out to my parents I feel like that kind of inspired me to like mix things and match things that I wouldn't normally make some match and I think it was really useful so I'm really excited about that hope you guys are all staying healthy and safe I'm a little bit emotionally unstable today and I'm kind of crazy I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy I'm like louder than normal a little bit like less connected but we're gonna get through this together and glad we can hang out today I love you all peace out [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-04-26T22:56:59Z,185144,3525349,7100,it is 2:00 in the morning round of applause for me we're doing an activity today at 2:00 am because I cannot do anything productive until 11:00 p.m. like nothing good happens to me before 11 p.m. I'm playing for a night that's it that's literally at plank or night in eating but it's 2:00 a.m. now so it's time it's time it's time to do something productive about a month ago I ordered something very exciting and I ordered this the second I knew that nail salons were gonna be shut down I knew that I needed this like I need this so we're gonna be doing our nails at 2:00 a.m. for fun first I'm gonna file my nails I'm so excited okay I'm gonna use this it's like a nice little mat to do my that's ugly I used to be huge in the nail art as a kid I was huge in an hour loved it I would actually go to people's houses after school and I would do their nails that only happened like twice but I'm gonna talk about it like it happened more because it's kind of a cute wholesome story I was really in Nellore I actually had a nail art account doesn't exist anymore so don't look for it but I was like pretty good at it actually I was pretty good at nail art so this might work out for me but I haven't done my nails since I was in middle school so this also could go really bad I don't really care though because I have nothing better to do and this is kind of a fun activity what is this LED light LED light nail surface cleanse so I need to do that maybe why did I smell that that was awful I don't want to go get cotton so I'm just gonna use a little bit of toilet paper it's kind of reminding me of like how I am with cooking I wouldn't be a bad cook if I just followed the rules and wasn't a lazy piece of [ __ ] but because I don't follow the recipe or the rules like I end up [ __ ] things up you guys stop having caps as fun until you want to turn on your camera and then it's just [ __ ] annoying so get out apply foundation here it is all right well I'm just nervous this is forever because I have to do one hand at a time and like when you're at the salon they're working on the other hand while you're like doing one hand you know what I mean this is gonna take forever but I'm here for it cuz I have nothing else to do my fifth-grade nail skills are absolutely gone this is kind of fun though I was like twelve somebody would have got me this for Christmas I would have lost my ring what's been on my mind but nothing nothing's been on my mind that's the problem let's talk about that it's not about the fact that I have no thoughts anymore don't worry like it's not that deep I'm just so painfully bored I think the thing that makes humans in general kind of like oh no this is when things are gonna get bad sorry need to pivot a little bit pivot the conversation cuz I'm painting with my non-dominant hand right now it's not gonna be good my right hand is gonna look like ass in my other hand is gonna look like ass but like a little bit less ass the thing that makes conversation is interesting is when you talk about like what you're up to like what you've been doing like funny things that have been happening to you but when you're inside all day there's none of that like what did i do today I woke up I drank my coffee I ate some food and then I played for at night for eight hours that's all I did and guess how many times I won three that's a big deal my nails have a base on them so far so good nothing bad has happened yet it says hella scary I feel like there's no going back now it's like colors going on loci like what if I just got really good at doing my own mammals like that could be a good hobby for me I'm always trying to find new hobbies because like me playing Fortnite recently like that's fun and all but like that's not a useful hobby it might be good for my mind like it might be kind of mine strengthening because am I just making excuses for my fortnight playing let's talk about something else I need to get creative with my conversation skills like Emma you must have something up there let me vent to you about what else I've been doing besides playing fortnight cuz it's like that's not it like it's not like like I'm mainly playing for a night but like there are other activities that occur one of them would be making different spreadsheets I will give you an example so I just moved and so obviously when you move sometimes like you have a different space that you're working with so you have to like get new furniture I've been doing a lot of furniture shopping and I made a spreadsheet about like what furniture piece goes in what room for no reason but I found that I'm gonna be coming kind of obsessed with spreadsheets still on tick-tock I made up my own tick-tock dance today it's been about 15 minutes on that and for what you know I'm gonna tell you guys a secret I'm gonna let you guys in on a secret I have not washed my hair in five days my hair is five days dirty right now and I'm telling you that because I just feel like I need to get it off my chest so don't come for me about it let me have a safe space to vent can you guys [ __ ] keep it down how awkward does this look with this hand like it looks so weird because I'm so uncoordinated I'm not ambidextrous here's what we have so far this is one coat what else should we talk about really gonna start pulling [ __ ] out of my ass now this will staying at home thing it's been actually I've learned it appreciate it in its own way I feel like I'm starting to like overthink everything I say and do and I'm having a lot of deja vu moments I don't know if that's just me I don't know if I'm [ __ ] crazy I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy for sure I think it's just I have more time on my hands to think about every single thing that I do me being really almost maybe kind of paranoid in this dance is making you better at Fortnight so maybe it's fine I'm getting little bit of paint around the edges but I feel like that's kind of inevitable no that works really well using the nail file giy hack I remember the first time I got acrylics was for my 8th grade graduation I wish I had a photo but I got like the ugliest shade of blue that they probably offered that was the first time I got acrylic nails I feel like it was kind of my eighth grade graduation present cuz I know a lot of kids had like acrylic nails in middle school or whatever and it was just so cool it was two things were cool in middle school that I was not really allowed to have acrylic nails and bellybutton ring never had either in retrospect no regrets this looks so bad like it's really not great I mean like if I'm moving them around like it doesn't look that bad I don't really like my natural fingernail shape to be honest like I don't really like it I mean I'm stuck with it what am I gonna do chop them off no there's no redos I got these fingers for life I had this nail salon I was going to do for a while and every single time I'd go I'd make an appointment they were great because they were really cheap and they did a really good job long story short the story is that I used to go snail song all the time and it was like a good experience I guess but every time I would go I would make an appointment and then they would make me wait anywhere between an hour to an hour and a half before they'd start on my nails and it was a huge time to take me half the day to get my nails done why are they still wet there's still way I don't get it how it I followed every direction I don't understand why it's not dry I put my hand in the dryer or LED light six times I actually put it in three buttons for entertainment be saying that I put it in six and what are you gonna do sue me you can't take it to court see what happens nothing okay now we really have some time to bond cuz like my nails are about to be in this [ __ ] dryer for the next six hours I'm hungry right now I'm hungry wanna know what I've been eating at night I'll tell you crackers and hummus second snack I've been getting these nuts almonds covered in almond butter I also like to have a spoonful of almond butter why am i eating somebody nothin night that's what she said if this works properly I mean okay if the nails even drop like if they dry great if not I don't know what I'm gonna do did I miss a step honey shouldn't do that carefully that kind of color put in your back but talking on did that what's the [ __ ] problem I'm just gonna keep them in this dryer for as long as I can piss me off when I do everything right and it still goes wrong and that has deeper meanings do walk to that just a lot to that that's deep why don't I tell you about my new right way I'm getting desperate see this ring light I just bought that my other ring light I've had since I started my youtube channel I was having to tape it back together with duct tape about a new ring light built it yesterday it's been complete homie ever since it's been totally coming in handy um 90% of this footage is just gonna be me like this they're still drying listen listen it was 2:00 a.m. at this point I didn't know what was going on nobody knew what do you know going on nothing that I was saying made sense they're still dry I needed to go to bed but I love that we're on this journey together xoxo okay it says to cleanse the nails with this nail surface cleanse maybe there's like a film on this okay that kind of did it maybe this isn't so bad after all do you want maybe I'll pose for a thumbnail for change I never do that I always just like random leads screenshot things going maybe for change thumbnail what the [ __ ] was that sound I don't know how youtubers pose for thumbnails okay my nails are done was it fun yeah but like they don't look amazing I mean they don't look terrible like they're totally good enough to like wear around like I'm not gonna remove them like I'm gonna leave them on this is fun maybe try it out maybe don't I don't care I mean I sound like I don't care but like it's like I care but it's like not a big deal that's a good way to put it it's not a big deal good luck to me am I gonna go to bed right now no I'm not really not probably gonna watch tic TOCs for an hour then I'm probably gonna go back downstairs then I'm probably gonna have a snack ie my the nuts that I was talking about maybe some crackers and some hummus might [ __ ] around and have some of that I miss my long tails I don't feel like a bad [ __ ] without that there was a phase there though when I was making them way too long oh my god they were so long they were going out to like right heroes crazy I like I don't know what I was thinking I don't know who let me do that and then I brought it up to my friend I was like you judging me when my nails were this long but you should have been like that's just gross and she was like yeah we were all judging you during that time and I was like oh okay overall that was really cute those are really cute it's a really cute activity like the results aren't like as good as I would have wanted but like at the same time it's [ __ ] nail color anyway I'm finally gonna [ __ ] in the video I love you all thanks for watching if you enjoyed I'll see you soon oh the middle finger looks fly right now [Music] goodbye [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-03-08T19:23:05Z,206182,5534562,6002,hi guys it's me it's me [Music] hi I'm leaving for a trip I'm going to Paris for Fashion Week with Louboutin for my third dime don't know why they keep inviting me back but it's Code Red because I leave tomorrow morning and I've not packed and it's now late at night I'm not prepared in the slightest I've barely even thought about the fact that I was going on a trip until today cuz I've just been kind of busy with honestly not much but basically I decided I would document me packing extremely last minute I kind of wanted to take you guys along for this painful journey even though it's late at night I'm going to make myself a coffee because I need to energize because I'm probably gonna be packing for the next two hours because it takes me forever to pack so let's get into it Chamberlain coffee comm Chamberlain car chimney car calm I have to pack all my outfits for the show so like that's gonna take up a big portion of my suitcase I also have to pack like pajamas and like makeup in toiletries and like it's definitely you're not gonna be the most fun but also I need to fit everything into a carry-on because if anything happens with my luggage I'm [ __ ] for the show cuz I wanted my outfit so it's like this struggle of fitting everything into a carry-on I just realized how stressful this is [ __ ] I didn't even really fully think about that until just now I'm just gonna check a bag do you know what [ __ ] it I'm so stressed out and I just cut my hair really short but I'm not gonna show it to you guys don't really want to embarrass myself order business let me show you the outfits that were sent to my house this is everything this videos gonna be so fun guys chaotic packing vlog yogi you're watching me pack for a trip so also look at this pile of laundry it's just been kind of building up on me and I'm not gonna put it away and then I'm gonna get home from my trip in the pile of laundry is still gonna be there guess who's gonna be upset about it me but guess who caused that problem me it's crazy how I self-sabotage hacking step one I need to pick out what suitcase I'm gonna bring here's an option no this is another option but I think this one might be too small okay I have an idea I might bring two bags is that really stupid I think I have to do that and I'm not happy about it but I don't really have a choice definitely you need to get out Declan you just have to stop playing with me how weird is this compartment in my apartment it's just like a piece of wood that you move no Declan don't go in there so we've made our luggage decision we're gonna do all of the valuable stuff in this and then we're gonna do all of the inconsequential [ __ ] in this okay you guys don't care I don't know why I'm still talking so we've made it it's time to start actually packing and I'm gonna talk you guys through how I pack I look really ugly right now it's so sad so sad cuz there's nothing I can do about it it's like genetic every time I go on a trip I pack all my makeup in this YouTube fanny pack as you can see it as the YouTube logo on it very fresh first something to pick out what brushes I need definitely need an eyebrow brush so there your powder brush this is a good one you need like a bronzer brush grab one this one's good gonna need an eyeshadow brush in a highlight brush perfect brushes and then I go through my steps at my makeup so I have my face makeup this is my color right okay good enough then I'm a concealer does that one and I have my bronzer then I have my highlight then I have lush I don't even wear blush don't know what I'm even thinking about oh I need my powder and I need my Beauty Blender am I missing anything from here I need mascara eyelash curler brow gel how bored are you guys right now probably so bored I'm missing something I know I am I can [ __ ] feel like my skin I can feel it my blood maybe I'm not missing anything really that might be a makeup packed check so next we're gonna be packing my toiletries my toiletries are already pre-packed like I already have mostly everything I have hair all in you don't look at that I'm gonna get [ __ ] roasted for that I feel like having a pre organised toiletry situation is very useful because then it's just already there I know that hotels give you shampoo and conditioner but I like weirdly don't trust Hotel shampoo and conditioner I feel like it's not reliable anything could be in there but you know what I mean refilling my [ __ ] because I'm gonna [ __ ] oh [ __ ] I like to [ __ ] a full-size toothpaste people learn [Music] oh damn it oh no works amazing it's weird because when I was younger going on trips used to be like such a big deal and I would like pack like a week ahead and now I packed the night before with no time to spare like literally right on time so really good personality trait to have super organized super responsible so my parents would be really proud make sure I have everything it looks super cute and organized though don't forget to pack lots of hair ties pack some bobby pins I literally am packing too because I've done left cuz they all disappear into thin air I need deodorant majid if I forgot that then the stinky rumors would come true oh my god Frankie is drinking out of the toilet so you guys did just miss it but Frankie was drinking straight out of the toilet so I raised her right she learns from her mom this is the ugliest thing I've ever seen I just bought this deodorant it's like a travel deodorant and it's like shaped in the fall Wow looks like a lip balm though I'm not gonna lie this is just not all gonna fit that's just it [ __ ] truth of the matter here I don't even have a toothbrush in here I haven't even packed a [ __ ] toothbrush I think I have everything I mean you could always go to the store right like that's my thing I'm always like I forgot something I could always go to the store we all just [ __ ] relax uh-huh toiletries are packed oh my god I need a hairbrush let's just pull the hair out of it first subscribe toiletries and makeup check we're done we're already done with that now

sponsoring today's video enjoy it going back to the video so all these garment bags right with these clothes in it okay here's one outfit I'll give you a little overview oh they gave me shoes okay so we have these shoes I'm obsessed with them we have this top with this dope pattern with these black pants that kind of flare at the bottom and then with that this leather jacket it's [ __ ] cool so that's the first outfit that I need to pack next is this dress and I now need to pick up shoes for that so this is my outfit for the show so everybody drum wall please this jacket to be paired with this it's these shorts with this top I'm obsessed with it I'll show you the shoes too because you know what guys I find I'll show you the shoes dope fitting all of this in this suitcase is not going to be an easy feat I think a key component is taking the hangers off the hangers are creating added problems that we don't need ok this jacket is just going to be a little bit wrinkled and there's just nothing I can do there's no way I'm fitting all of this I don't know what to do I'm not precise with much think many things that I do in my life like I feel like I'm so I rush everything declan's trying to knock over my camera and I'm not gonna let him do it defens stop I'm asking you nicely I did manage to fit all the clothes in there but we do have a few more things we need to fit in there I'm just gonna work on that now ok wait it actually all fit it literally all fit this is the best day ever she's done all of the outfits are packed job well done now is my least favorite part do you know what I hate about packing is when it's like ok time to pick out like what underwear you're gonna bring like I hate that shape I need to pick out like what oh what if I just like literally pack nothing you know like what if I just like literally pack nothing like what if I gave up and just was like you know what I'm not even gonna bring a cute outfit I'm just bringing pajamas and like that's it and like you guys are gonna deal with it like what if I just did that you know what is anybody gonna say nobody can say [ __ ] to me I can do what I want ok we're in my closet now it's time to start exploring potential outfits I only need two so let's start out with pants I just got these pants recently that I really like they're really cool so these are a potential pant to wear I'll probably need a basic pair of jeans just in case these are good staple pair of jeans I wear them like every day so might as well bring them today I bought some pants that I feel like could work for this so first I got these they're this cool pattern there Green those could be cool also got these they're kind of see-through though you can see through them so I guess I don't want to be in any direct light somebody might see my [ __ ] I have this vintage sets like this purple skirt in a matching top that could be dope to bring to why the [ __ ] off my drawers closing I'm so frustrated right now I'm like getting [ __ ] means and now that I have some pants picked out it's time to decide what shirts go with them okay I have this vintage red jacket that could be cool he ovie I'm looking around trying to figure out what I like and what I hate in this life so that I can decide what to wear what do I wear it's the worst time of the day I need to start trying on outfits basically what I do when I'm packing is that I just pick out a few outfits like I pick out let's say I need two outfits for the trip I will pick out five and then I'll narrow down to my top two time to try on outfits outfit number one okay I actually like this one think I'm gonna pack it as you can see here we have this set going on don't know where it's from because it's vintage I got enough deep hop black mock next random again then I have these shoes kind of professional a little bit fashionable so if it's cold in Paris then this is gonna be a cold outfit but you know what beauty is pain ooh I like this outfit okay I kind of hate it it's good enough I'm packing it next outfit oh I don't love it I don't love it but I like don't really want to try that hard to make it better that's where we're at I think I might just bring one extra outfit I don't really I feel like I'm just gonna cancel this one and then this one I feel like I just need to assemble one bomb as [ __ ] outfit bring that you know what let me see what I can whip up this is good enough for me um I'm gonna stick with this oh my god assumed in so far so this is a good outfit I feel like it's comfortable it's cute it does a trick it gives me Paris vibes you know I'm bringing this outfit in this outfit only [ __ ] the purple outfit [ __ ] the other outfit cutting myself off this is it I losing my mind houses stubbed my toe and it's now bleeding we're not having the best time I'm spoke of all my neighbors so after some crying I've decided because I'm having all of this that I need to bring a bear suitcase so we're bringing out the big guns and we're bringing the big suitcase I didn't want to do this we're doing it I didn't want you but we are let's get into it we're almost done we're almost done I'm so close let's do this we have our toiletries and we have our makeup and we have our hairbrush and then we have our shoes another pair of shoes just in case I want to exercise which probably won't happen but can also pack these shoes first outfit this is my casual outfit okay we have some blue Levi's a black mock neck that actually has deodorant all over it so that's a good sign also has can here on it so that's going in I'm packing this ugly as [ __ ] 70s a t-shirt that I found on deep hop and then I'm bringing two extra shirts to wear with those blue jeans we have this little mock neck then I'm bringing this little colored shirt that I wear way too often next we have our fashionable outfit which is these pants that I showed you okay back to those and then we have this red jacket that's coming with us next I will be bringing this with this skirt just because although I was kind of hesitant [ __ ] the purple outfit [ __ ] the other of it now that I'm bringing a bigger suitcase this could come in handy so I might as well have it with me now I'm packing my PJs I have this and then sweatpants obviously [ __ ] obviously well I of so much extra room in my suitcase this is psycho this never happens oh because I'm also packing this hoodie it has John Lennon on it and Yoko Ono so that's really sweet and precious I think I could actually fit my bag in here which is kind of amazing Wow I do need a pair of sneakers and I also need tampons I have my black converse which will be going in here somewhere I've never a lot of space to go shopping like I could definitely do some shopping while I'm there which I won't because I'm responsible but I could if I wanted to but I won't I probably will we done carry on carry on time we have a lot of tampons you kind of just need that tampons readily available at all times oh I have these foot things for if my feet get sore while wearing high heels Oh should pack some gum that comes in handy you never know who you're gonna kiss for me it's no one but for you it could be somebody I'm gonna bring an entire pack of dayquil because in nyquil I could get sick so that's nice to have I get headaches a lot when I travel so I'm gonna refill my advil my mini little advil thing Oh am i literally done is that it I'm scared I know I forgot something I have a phone charger I literally even have a phone charger like I'm so prepared I'm almost too prepared like I'm scared my ear pods okay so I brought my air pods which actually don't work they're literally broken so that's super upsetting but I'm gonna bring them anyway cuz they're good enough these are my reading glasses these work good I have so many pairs I just throw them everywhere because I have astigmatism which I don't even know what that means but it makes my vision not as good as it should be can I just be done already and go to bed cuz I have to wake up and then go okay I'm done this is the first time in literally a year that I've been able to close my suitcase without sitting on it so here's what we're bringing we have suitcase number one backpack number one carry-on number number three don't know if I'm alone after we carry on it's too bad I actually in fact do and there's something that they can do so I've now packed this is a great thumbnail watch me okay guys that is it that entire experience was a complete fever dream for me I don't remember literally one moment of filming this video I have no idea what I just did for the past two hours and I need to go to bed because I need to be up to go to MERIS I'm very excited I will be talking anyway trip in Paris so you guys want to see that stay tuned [ __ ] next week when I post that video I hope that you had fun hanging out with me there is no tangible take away from this video at all because I didn't teach you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2020-03-01T21:47:33Z,222807,5830334,7699,[Music] welcome to the ultimate thank you burger taste test you I just looked in the [ __ ] you find her and my smile did not look good so I'm okay I'm so excited right now cuz this is a food video and I love I love that today I am gonna go to every fast-food place and I'm gonna get a veggie burger from there and I'm gonna taste it and I'm gonna find out the best fast-food veggie burger because if you guys are like me which you're probably not or maybe you are I don't know in you're vegetarian it's hard to find fast food that's vegetarian that's good and a few years ago I did a video where I went to all the fast-food chains and I tried vegan fast-food like whatever they had but I sometimes you want a burger so today I'm gonna try all of the veggie burgers at these fast-food places so that you don't have to I really don't have this mapped out I have no idea where I'm gonna go home first kind of stressed out I think it makes the most sense to go to McDonald's first so let's do it I think it sucks about being a vegetarian is that you don't get to experience the drive-through as much because you can't just like drive-through and get a burger whenever you're feeling it when you're vegetarian I feel like you actually go into the establishment because most of the places that have food for us it's that type of place we have to go in and sit in sometimes you want to just get in now and that's why that's why it's hard what was my point I don't even know where I was going with that I have not filmed in my car and so long and let me tell you why so I got a new car like a year ago over a year ago and I haven't really filming the car since because this car has the worst [ __ ] layout do and everyone's hung at me because I'm going so slow but it's literally because I don't my camera to fall anyway glad that we can have that understanding also the lighting is terrible whenever I Drive in the car it's tough but we make it work am I gonna [ __ ] damn it damn it turning is scary like I know my camera's gonna fall one of these turns I just know it I can [ __ ] feel it my bones so life update last video I made I said I had no video ideas after I had a mental breakdown about having no video ideas I ended up coming up with like 10 so now I have like ten solid video ideas don't know where those ideas were when I didn't have any ideas after I go through all those ideas things might go back to [ __ ] and I there's no promises hoping for the best oh my god I thought I just flipped him off even though I've had no video ideas which is kind of upset me I've really been in a good mood for like the past two weeks I'm sick right now but I'm still in a good mood and like that says something you know what I think it is I think it's because I've been more social you know I've just been talking to more people just trying to be like a social gal hoping that this lasts anyway we'll see you at McDonald's oh we're at McDonald's I'm not even sure if McDonald's has a veggie burger I feel like they have to yes yay wait I'm showing weight I don't want to show you guys because then I have to move my camera off the tripod no I need to be better about filming things no [ __ ] do you know what I'm just going to take a photo of it and then I'm gonna insert it in the video look how dark and dreary this [ __ ] drive-through is I'm literally terrified and the line is really long I was just not anticipating this complicated experience hi can I do a veggie burger you don't what's the closest you have to imagine burger um I'll get the hamburger with no patties that is me thank you so much so nice to meet you I love this okay that was a sweetest woman I've ever met she was such an angel but they don't have a veggie burger here what the [ __ ] okay so McDonald's does have a veggie burger [ __ ] I cannot fit through this [ __ ] driveway I got a burger without the patty so that's gonna be probably kind of gross but it might be good I don't even know how many places I'm to go to today maybe I'll go to 50 who knows maybe I'll go to every fast-food chain maybe I'll drive all the way to another state to try even more who knows thank you ma'am have a good one it's trying time burger number one this is Burger King wait no stop this is McDonald's yo vegetarians get no love is there just cheese there is literally this is a joke I'm sorry am I being mean I mean it doesn't taste bad actually uh-oh why doesn't it taste bad okay all right would I ever get that again definitely not it doesn't taste bad but it's just the most pointless thing I've ever eaten in my life I'm gonna give McDonald's a three out of ten it wasn't bad in taste bad but it was like not something I never get again am I upset a little bit when I was a kid I could see myself kind of enjoying that because when you're a kid you weirdly have like seven tastebuds and you don't even know what you're eating half the time hopefully Burger King comes through with more of a more of a passion I feel a little bit stupid I really kind of stupid going through the drive-thru melee can I have a veggie burger and they don't even have that on the menu but actually you know what when the camera was off at Google date in sub locations do have veggie burgers I think so that was not my fault all right we're on our way I'll see you at McDonald's I mean nope I'll see you at Burger King okay we're at Burger King Burger King check oh hi do you guys have a veggie burger it's not what the impossible whopper is okay cool I'll get the impossible whopper thank you I have a feeling this one's gonna be lucky good I don't know I'm kind of feeling good about it I also just found out that Wendy's has a veggie burger and guess what's the next door to me right now oh I don't know maybe just a [ __ ] Wendy's while we're waiting to give this Burger King burger let's [ __ ] Leary observe how [ __ ] hilarious that McDonald's one was literally look at this they gave me one [ __ ] pickle I'm not gonna be mean I'm just I'm not in the mood to be mean today one thing I'm noticing about drive-throughs is that there's no space they're so narrow I literally feel like I'm about to crash my car I'm literally like 400 feet away from an IHOP right now it's in my direct vision I can see the IHOP International House of Pancakes for those who are confused can we throw it back to when it was I hop International House of burgers that was a fever dream I don't want to remember it thank you boom I feel like I'm gonna have the worst on the cake of my life after filming this the lighting is shitty I'm aware let's just act like it's not as bad as it and it's funny story about the Wendy's I'm at right now cuz I'm at Wendy's burger number three already I'm gonna try the Wendy's one in the oh my god that guy's [ __ ] jaywalking and I almost hit them I'm gonna try the Wendy's and the Burger King at the same time because why not oh my god there's no line at Wendy's hi do you guys have a veggie burger can I just get a burger or a cheeseburger without the patty I literally googled before coming to Wendy's whether or not they had a [ __ ] veggie burger and they said that they do thank you have a good one okay I'm not gonna lie it is crazy how quickly they get you your food like that was so [ __ ] fast I also can never understand what people are saying over the like speaker when you're ordering food fast food say that again so I really don't know what she said I actually don't really know what she's giving me right now so like this could be anything I know it's not a veggie patty though and that's really upsetting so first we're gonna try the Burger King this is the first actual veggie burger of the evening because apparently all the web sites and sources that are telling me that these places that veggie burgers are lying oh wow this is an experience this looks amazing I don't like tomatoes though so I will be taking that out all right let's do this let's try it that is hella good whoa Burger King you did it dude that [ __ ] is [ __ ] good if you are a vegetarian and you want a veggie burger on the go that is so good Burger King I'm gonna give you a ten out of ten no Han ten down hands out often but like that's really good and super easy to get cuz there's so many Burger Kings everywhere I love that so let's move on to the Wendy's Burger very disappointed because online it says they're testing out a black bean burger that was not true they don't have that so oh my god there's meat in it there's literally meat in it damn it okay Wendy's you get a zero out of ten because I can't even eat this they lied online and then they gave me meat in my burger although she did say something to me that I didn't understand say that again so I could have been the one in the wrong there the fact that the [ __ ] Burger King burger was so good I like can't even be mad about anything right now but I'll give the [ __ ] Wendy's Burger to one of my friends that eats meat and it'll be fine but I'm still kind of upset I've decided that we're gonna go to in-n-out burger next ok the lighting is just not getting better we're going to in and out next now I know for a fact that in-and-out doesn't have veggie burgers but I'm still gonna go because I've heard a lot of people say that they're grilled cheese which is basically two [ __ ] patties and a piece of American cheese but whatever I've heard that that's actually really good I don't think anything's gonna beat the impossible whopper especially because there are no options dude what do you do sorry I just got literal road rage on camera I wish that more fast food places would [ __ ] have a real real last veggie burger just own that [ __ ] I think some locations of these fast-food joints do have veggie burgers but I just think that apparently the ones in the area that I live just and that's just my problem so I'll see you I didn't and out wish me luck just got in line at in-and-out and the line that literally has 15 cars in it they're coming up to cars and placing orders that's good but this is like the longest line ever hi can I just get a grilled cheese thank you I'll see you when I get my grilled cheese it might be like six hours cuz the line in and out is literally the longest line that anyone's ever seen why is the lighting so bad dude God [ __ ] strain my net oh my god that hurt my neck we're here it's time in and out baby thank you you too I'm currently in the process of mentally preparing myself for the best grilled cheese I've ever had and if it's not we're gonna have a huge problem because I just waited like a half-hour for said grilled cheese and if it doesn't literally move me and change my life I'm gonna be a little bit frustrated I might actually try it while I'm driving go ahead I have the right away but go ahead actually I don't have the right away I don't know why I said that I'm just a [ __ ] I'm just a [ __ ] when I Drive okay let's try this wait wait it is good oh wow loki that is really good okay in and out you know what I'm gonna give you guys a solid eight out of ten let's assess in and out I'm putting my face in the Sun so you can see me I'm upset that there's no veggie patty so I'm removing two points but the flavor is really good like you almost don't even notice there's no like patty cuz it's like just good like there's a lot of flavor the bun is really good sorry I burped in the middle of that my only complaint is that there's no veggie patty but ate understand it's still a solid a solid meal I'm gonna go home now and there's a few things I'm gonna order to my house because I feel like there's still a few more places I need to try but I want to order them to my house cuz I'm getting kind of lazy and the lighting is getting really bad so we're gonna go home for the last few in and out a ton I can I can [ __ ] with it sounds good oh my god it's been like six hours I exercised which is why I look probably worse than I've ever looked in my life like my hair is all sweaty but I just worked out and before I take a shower which actually I don't shower anyway so never mind before I go lay in my bed just kidding I'm going to shower while I'm like starving from working out I'm gonna try our last two burger first one is Carl's jr. I'm really excited about this because this actually is a veggie burger like this has a patty in the whole nine yards so let's try it out the presentation is great she's kind of been sitting for a few hours so not hours minutes what the [ __ ] I ordered it now I'm postmates so it actually probably has been a few hours Loki anyway this is her she looks great the presentations they're definitely comparable to Burger King so let's try it out where's a good place to aim here Wow I'm gonna show you the paddy by itself this literally looks like real meat but it's not I can tell but it looks like it dude that's super impressive Carl's jr. underrated for us vegetarians that was really good it's like they nailed the burger like texture and taste and all that I'm basing that out for the fact that I tried a burger once a real one presentation was their flavor was great I'm actually really confused I don't know whether I like Burger King or Carl's jr. better so I'm gonna give that a 10 out of 10 along with Burger King they both get 10 out of 10 last but not least we have five guys this doesn't have a patty in it this is just like random [ __ ] in a bun oh my god you okay it has bell peppers ketchup mustard lettuce tomato I don't understand what the [ __ ] this is but it might be good let's try it no that tastes like what throw-up would taste like if you ate it like let's say you threw up and then you ate it five guys that's what your veggie sandwich tastes like no never again but let's make our conclusions here yeah this was an entire day ordeal ID with a little quick hiatus but I did do this all day and I enjoyed it I actually had more fun than I've had in months so if you want me to be a food critic moving forward let me know comment down below I will be your food critic I will try everything for you so you don't have to that's my new catchphrase I'll try it so that you don't have to McDonald's sucked Burger King was fire Wendy's not edible in and out great but no patty so kind of questionable not the full experience so a Carl's jr. impressive five guys vomit vimes the two winners which I would say actually are tied would have to be Carl's jr. and Burger King the presentation was there the flavor was there the experience was there next in line would be in and out the flavor was there but the fact that there was no veggie patty in it kind of threw me off I don't think I would get it again but I like might like it tasted good but like weirdly I'd feel weird ordering that so I don't know if I'd get it again and then for the last few Five Guys Wendy's McDonald's I wouldn't recommend getting the veggie burger from there I'd recommend getting something else don't do that yeah I think that's it sorry you guys had to look at me sweaty for the last few minutes of this video I I'm upset I love you guys enjoy your day enjoy your week enjoy your month whatever I love you all very much and thank you for your patience as I'm figuring out who I am as a human being maybe I shouldn't have gotten that deep right before I end the video because that's a conversation that's out bye guys see ya [Music]

-emma chamberlain",2020-02-09T21:34:59Z,194285,3025139,7507,"hi this is like crazy i [ __ ] set up a ring light for this video this is serious [ __ ] how are all of you I hope you guys are having a great day I set up a ring light for this video so it's gonna be a good one because I'm putting a [ __ ] maximum effort in today I'm going to be doing something that I wanted to do for so [ __ ] long but I'm just like I don't want to do it because I know that I'm gonna hate this I'm gonna be watching my old videos and reacting to them for the first time in like three years I don't want to know who I was back then I don't want to know I don't think I like her I don't want to know her okay but today I am going to face it oh that's gonna be [ __ ] painful and hurt me to watch I think it would be kind of fun to like embarrass myself in a way I mean they're still on the Internet let's see let's pull up my youtube I went through multiple phases of my YouTube channel like in the beginning I thought I was like a [ __ ] fashion and beauty type of youtuber because I did like those things but like I definitely wasn't passionate enough about them to be making videos about them but yet I still was anyway and then eventually I evolved into what I am now which I don't really even know what that means but it like it least is a little bit more me I would say I think it only makes sense to start out by watching my first video which is a lookbook City inspired summer look both 2017 that's the title city inspired what the [ __ ] does that mean City inspired okay um shut the [ __ ] up I also put the year in their 2017 don't know what I was thinking I mean I was fully a 16 year old at this point there's like no excuse for my behavior I'm not even I'm not even two seconds in and I am in [ __ ] agony number one the like title scream what is it and it has the worst sound effect to go along with it listen to like that is okay I'm just gonna move on but that's like really bad you you I know you cannot be saying [ __ ] to me right now being like Emma you're so dramatic like that was you yeah it was me and I bet that you at home are cringing hey guys like what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] there's inspired by in San Francisco it was okay also why is the audio so [ __ ] awful it's like you just I I can barely hear what I'm [ __ ] saying so that's good yeah hope you enjoy [Music] dude I need to chill with that [ __ ] sound effect it is just not working okay well this first outfit is just hideous [Music] no I'm skipping to the second outfit [Music] okay the second outfit is better like I would probably wear it something like this now like not really but like it's not as bad still cringy I don't know what the [ __ ] is going on okay with this third outfit I was really trying to do something here with this third outfit I was trying to do something and I wasn't succeeding the outfits in this up house I'm just so glad you know what evolving is good let's see the fourth outfit and then I'm moving on to the next video because I don't think I can [ __ ] watch this anymore okay Loki this outfit was the best it was not that bad it's a little bit weird but I still wear those shorts now three years later but I we need to move on from this video because that was my first video ever I'm gonna cut myself some slack was it cringy was the audio terrible where the outfit shitty yes am I surprised that nobody subscribed to me after watching this video yes I mean no no I'm not supposed I'm not surprised that nobody was subscribing at this point because I wouldn't want to watch that [ __ ] either and I'm sorry do you know what let's watch my second video my second video is titled how to DIY Rose patch Vance I remember thinking that this video is gonna like [ __ ] kill him I was like yes DIY Rose patch Vance these are trendy as [ __ ] everybody's gonna be [ __ ] watching this [ __ ] hey guys it's Emma and today I'm back with another video and today I'm gonna beat this hurts so [ __ ] bad why am i [ __ ] talk today like [ __ ] my this video now has 37,000 thumbs up and 176 thumbs down in my opinion that should be flip embroidered vans basically I got this idea from Pinterest because I love Pinterest definitely go follow me on there I kind of I'm kind of that's like one of my favorite forms of social media and a weird way I just love it okay my question I'm actually like genuinely wondering like is this who I was genuinely back then in it she's just cringy or was I like just putting on a front because I didn't know how to hack to burn the camera that's what I'm trying to figure out like I don't I don't know if if this is just genuinely how I used to act back then I bet I could make those on my own so today I'm going to be trying to make this up today Alvers subscribe hope you enjoy and subscribe what the [ __ ] I chose to do iron-on oh geez alright not gonna lie this video is boring as [ __ ] sorry past Emma this [ __ ] sucks okay also this video is so blurry I can't get over how blurry it it's like I just did not know how to use a camera I was using my dad's Canon Mark 2 or something and it didn't have autofocus and I didn't have anybody there to manually focus the camera so okay so that's it for today's video I hope you enjoyed um these are the completed shoes it turned out really well so definitely try these out if you think that they look cool you could do it on any kind of shoes even like the side of converse would be really cool maybe I'll have to do that this worked with a belt so I'm really happy ok weirdly I feel like I was loosened up towards the end of the video like I feel like I was talking a little bit more normally you know it was only my second video is only my second day out here like give me a chance all right let's move on that was fun but that sucked okay the next video that I need to watch I actually really want to watch this it was my first vlog ever the video is called I need a fidget spinner okay it was like the first time I feel like I did a video that was like similar to what I do now this is what I knew that I needed to be a vlogger rather than a beauty guru good morning today is G vii it's exactly ten o'clock Anne and I have a coke a my skin [ __ ] I look like I have no pores I have aged like 50 years since this [ __ ] so oh my god I've been dealing with cat issues for quite some time I need a fig it's been her and I need it now I mean this is like a little bit less cringy but I'm still uncomfortable like I feel like I can deal with this one tomorrow I think I have to do this the old-fashioned way I think I actually have to go to the store I really thought I was [ __ ] a comedic genius I really was like I need to go to the store dun dun duh like shut the [ __ ] up dude is here oh my god she was using meme editing I was editing like a mean back then just putting in the [ __ ] urn sound effect in there so day 1 that was that was in there I appreciate that now that I have this piece of art let's freaking out box this thing oh my god I just remembered such a disgusting part of my [ __ ] life that I forgot about I used to say Fred let's freakin unbox this thing no way what [ __ ] okay I don't know how the Frick to use this no way okay I'm done with that video that part was funny when I hit my tooth I can't lie I did laugh at that so I'll give myself some credit there okay so the next one that caught my eye I'm specifically choosing ones that I know I'm too cringe at easy and affordable ways for you guys to improve your style [ __ ] some of these things might be out of your comfort zone and I recommend that you just try them because I know for me I love that I'm like trying to give people advice about stepping outside of their fashion comfort zone when I'm wearing a free people halter lace bra let with a [ __ ] brandy melville gray off the shoulder top and I'm trying to tell people to step out of their comfort zones honey you look you stepped out of [ __ ] hacks on sales section two months ago I would have never see myself wearing or purchasing salvus there's something so fun about being unique Oh Emma your unique look in the mirrors to tip on how to just really make yourself more unique and new is cool sunglasses okay low-key this is true I do think sunglasses really do spice up an outfit but I still hate this [ __ ] I like to get my colored glasses from Amazon for just really cheap they look so great in Instagram photos wait wait can we rewind real quick I like to get my colored glasses from Amazon for just really cheap they look so great I just [ __ ] like jump cut it and I [ __ ] didn't have the glasses on and then they were on absolute editing savage and then my last glasses that aren't the most flattering but they're so fun that I just had to include them um these are them glasses are [ __ ] idiots I think we can safely say that the fashion tips need to be retired I don't want to watch this video anymore what are we gonna watch next I'm not even done get to know me tag it is 20 minutes long so we will not be watching this whole thing because I would kind of rather punch myself in the head hello guys so hello haha so today I'm going to be dedicating this whole video to telling you stuff about me um ok low-key kind of missing being blonde right now from this my like skin was so good I was like tan and blonde damn it [ __ ] I am drink two coffees before I started filming this so it's not be good tonight it's gonna be a good time what the [ __ ] I did drink two coffees back then even back then in 2017 you know would have been really helpful for me back then though if I would have known about Chamberlain coffee calm pretty sad that that didn't exist yet but thank God it does now Hamlin coffee calm I like a bunch of different colors for a bunch of different reasons so I really have an answer but I like all colors um yeah as long as the nice nice you know just kidding uh you uh I don't really like pop music I'm not the biggest country music fan but I like you know alternative kind of a me you I was such a [ __ ] I mean I'm not lying but it's just the way I was saying it hurts so bad you will never regret being kind I mean true I mean that is yeah that's true but shut up okay I'm moving on I don't want to see they get to know me tag anymore that's that's that on that that's that on that what else could we watch let's watch my first cooking with Emma there's a video called vegan pizza sucks I think we need to check it out also I actually love vegan pizza now so I don't know what [ __ ] I was talking about okay new intro new intro looking a little bit fresher I can respect that I hope you like this let's do this we're gonna hang out together low-key this was like two months after I started my channel and I was kind of starting to be a little bit more normal I think I like this chick I didn't really plan this out very well because this is actually not vegan I assumed that it was vegan I don't even have anything to say about this video low-key it just doesn't bother me like I mean the other ones bothered me this one just doesn't bother me I don't have anything to say like she kind of be the same [ __ ] me I feel like my job here is done okay but low-key I probably should watch before we end this video do you know what as the finale we're gonna react to the video that started it all we all owe the dollar store an apology this was the first video that kind of blew up for me this video got like a half million views when I had like 10,000 subscribers to finish this video off we're gonna watch it and see those crunchy and see what happens you're gonna be your mind is gonna be blown I felt like something like 12 things guess how much money I paid $12 cuz like each thing is a dollar you know make sense right okay low-key I don't hate her I don't hate her did I hate the girl in the first few videos yes but at this point I don't hate her she had been making videos for like two months she was figuring it out she knows who she is now she's not being fake anymore she's figured out her voice I like her so I thought this jushiro set and you might be like Emma you know why would you purchase that are you still confused if you're still confused as to why I bought this why are you here this is the coolest thing I've ever bought in my life how much do they pay for this one dollar look at all these freaking q-tips all for one dollar that's great enough no it gets better this is frozen q-tips froze it why am i laughing at my own video the next thing I got is a completely crucial item that I just really needed and it was a light bulb okay this isn't a part of this I just needed a light bulb so okay I'm done I'm actually done I really did enjoy this experience it showed me that I am in constantly evolving person I hope you guys enjoyed thank you for all the people that were watching this this [ __ ] and I appreciate all you guys thank you for coming along on this journey with me it's crazy out quickly three years just [ __ ] flew by I literally blinked in three years past and everything changed I'm gonna go lay in bed and reflect on that I feel like that's just like [ __ ] [ __ ] with my head like not in a bad way but just like a crazy way it's crazy to like watch a video of yourself and like almost be it almost feels like you're in the room with yourself three years ago it's a little weird have an amazing night an amazing day go get yourself a fidget spinner you won't regret it okay [Music]"

-emma chamberlain",2020-01-05T21:10:44Z,274747,5402629,9367,[Music] Declan you're gonna get a brother today you're getting a brother you want that well you don't really have a choice um new year new cat that's my motto this year maybe it's my motto for the rest of my life maybe every year I'm just gonna get a new cat and by 2050 I'm gonna have like what does that make it like 31 cats or something anyway well I'm a cat lady now never thought I'd say that but I'm getting a new kitten today let me explain why but first hold on give me a sec to adjust here cuz I need I have some things they need to do I need to make coffee okay I'll use this cup it's cute right oh I'm tired I just don't okay now I can talk I have had my cat Declan for a few months now and I loved him he's great he's actually kind of annoying sometimes but I do love him stop no but I do think that he's kind of lonely I do travel a lot and I feel guilty and I know that he misses his mommy which is me cuz you know who wouldn't miss me right anyway so I did some research and I found out that there's actually a lot of benefits basically it's better to have two cats rather than one that's what we're doing today making myself a little bit of Chamberlain coffee go to Chamberlain coffee com2 check that out okay now that that's over now we can back to the video not sponsored well it's my own company's I don't know how that works my friend got a kitten recently I just can't stop rubbing its little belly I can't stop every time I'm at their house I just want to rub the kittens belly now older cats are fun too like I actually like Declan dad is more mature age but I wouldn't mind having a little kid in my life right my fear is that Declan and the kitten won't get along or that Declan will feel neglected by me but to be completely honest I would love to have a snuggle party with more than cat imagine this you know what I'm up I'm an independent woman and I sleep in bed every night by myself I deserve to have multiple cats around me while I'm sleeping that's like the minimum of what I deserve why is my straw not going into my cup I don't understand you know like I was an only child growing up and right now currently Declan is an only child and although I did enjoy being an only child I do think that if I would have had a sibling I probably would have had a little bit more of an interesting childhood so I'm gonna give Declan the interesting childhood that he deserves declan's maiden um he's in his teen phase and he's loving to play with things such as my furniture my lambs such as my fingers my ears my face my toes my knees my elbows likes to you try to rip them apart but I read online that having two cats is better for the owner because they play with each other rather than with your limbs stop anywho cheers cheers to kitty time okay so we're here I've been brainstorming some names even though like I haven't even met the cat yet but I've been brainstorming some names and I thought I'd share what I've came up with well my number one name right now is Frankie I want to name him Frankie I don't know it just is cute but I also kind of like the name Ronnie so Frankie and Ronnie are my number ones I feel like Frankie's kind of in the running just because I like the name Frankie and like Frankie and Declan sounds cute so you're my other name ideas scary Riley Archie in Rico definitely not gonna name Rico but I did think that that one was fun well I mean I might I mean cuz I love Napoleon Dynamite the movie and so it kind of wouldn't mind naming him after uncle Rico from that movie but let's go get kitty [Music] okay update kind of disappointing times this morning so I just went in there and I met this cat named Chester and he was very cute but he's a little bit too old I kind of want a younger kitten I'm going to a different shelter now to go check out more cats I'm hoping that the next place I go to has kittens supposedly they do crossing my fingers okay listen um I just went to another shelter and I went in and I was in there for about two minutes and they had three kittens total two of them were sold it looks exactly like Declan anyway which I wouldn't have wanted to do because I swear to God if I get a cat that looks like Declan I'm gonna start getting them confused and I'm not gonna know who's who and it's gonna be really bad anyway go in there they've one kitten available for adoption it is a little tiny mean female cat which is basically the opposite of everything I want I want a nice cat and I want a male cat I mean she was really sweet but she just was really hated me she's hissing at me and I took it personal so that's not working out so now we're going on to our third adoption center so I need to [ __ ] hurry over there before they run out of their [ __ ] kittens cuz apparently kittens are in high demand please pray for me I want a cat is this like a sign that I shouldn't be getting a cat I'm not giving up I'm not giving up till I go home with a cute cute ass [ __ ] kitten I am NOT going home with that one [Music] I'm about to meet a few kings they're actually all female so I wasn't expecting that but it looks like it might be getting

HOW I PREPARE THE COFFEE!

cold brew:
put 3 of the bags in 600 mL/2.5 cups/20 oz of water, then let sit overnight. pour over ice and add milk/creamer for the best cold brew EVER!!!!

hot coffee:
pour hot water over the bag and let sit for 5+ minutes (I prefer to steep the bag for around 10-20 minutes because I like stronger coffee, but brew to your personal taste)

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-12-22T21:00:13Z,240145,4546991,8864,whoa [Music] hi two years ago i don't know if it was two years ago or like three years ago or what it was but a few years ago i made a video called emma's legendary coffee recipe where i basically showed you how i made coffee at home using a lot of steps there's actually a lot of steps in that video i did a french press and then i put them and then i put the hot french press coffee into mason jars put the mason jars in the fridge so that was my old coffee recipe i don't feel like it's fair that i have not updated you on my ideal and favorite home coffee recipe currently because i have a new method so here's to emma's legendary coffee recipe [Music] part two i actually already had some as you can see so that's why there's like poo poo at the bottom of that step one get ice after you have a decent amount of ice take your cold brew here's my cold brew pause if you're like emma how do you make cold brew let me tell you where's my other big mason jar [ __ ] why does this happen every time i film so here's how i make my favorite cold brew of all time i've never had better cold brew before that's the damn truth i'm gonna take three of these coffee bean bags so basically these are almost like tea bags in a sense that have fresh coffee in them they smell incredible and i'm gonna put three of these into my mason jar this packaging is renewable and compostable so it's not wasteful by the way once you have three of the steeped coffee bags in the mason jar you're gonna fill it up to i believe it's it's like 600 milliliters i'm not good at math so anyway okay so it looks like you fill it up to around 600 milliliters and or how many cups is that two and a half cups it looks like although i can't really read that very well so i don't really know i lost all of my mason jar tops toppers so i use this and i put it over top of the cold brew to kind of seal it and then it looks like this kind of like i'm growing like a succulent or something but no it's cold brew then i pop in the fridge overnight and then i have the best most flavorful cold brew in all of america in my opinion after i have about this much cold brew in my cup i like to do a lot of cold brew because i like my coffee pretty strong then i take these two ingredients i have this vanilla almond milk and nut pod creamer which i stopped using this for literally two years ever since i started drinking this cold brew i've been using it again and it's great so then you add a little bit of this they also have different flavors of this too it's probably good i haven't tried it though mix it's so good it reminds me of my coffee recipe that i used to make when i was younger with the french press and all that but it's better if you're like emma where am i supposed to find steeped coffee bags that is something that i don't know where to find that because that's hard to find because it's not something that you just commonly see in stores um i think i have your back these are mine i these are this mine we need to talk we need to talk because i think i have something that i have to explain before i explain why this has my name on it let's talk about what do we even want to talk about what do i even talk about i don't know how to make videos like this this is something that i'm extremely proud of basically what it is is it's a steeped coffee bag it looks like this this is the packaging the packaging is renewable and compostable it's eco-friendly basically it looks like a tea bag it smells like fresh coffee smells incredible i literally could smell this all day i want to put one of these my car literally because it smells so good these bags are super versatile you can make cold brew with them in the way that i showed you or you can put them into hot water and make a hot cup of coffee you can put it in for like five minutes or if you're like me and you like your coffee super strong i put mine in for like 10 minutes when i do hot coffee although i rarely ever drink hot coffee because why would i do that and i'm super excited to be selling them on chamberlaincoffee.com for you guys to purchase if you'd like this is one of the coolest things i think i've ever done because if you know me you know that i've been passionate about coffee forever there's so many reasons why like i love the flavor i love the social element i love the energy it gives you obviously but i just think there's something about coffee to me that's so comforting and it's always been that way but i've also always been really picky about coffee i've never had an efficient way to bring coffee around with me when i'm traveling or an efficient way to make coffee at home that was actually really really good like i've always struggled to make good coffee at home coffee either isn't flavorful enough or there's too many steps so i don't want to make the coffee so then i end up going to a cafe instead and spending seven dollars on a latte and so my goal with this was to basically give everyone a way to make coffee easily that actually tastes good making coffee can be really complicated if you're doing a french press you have to have the grinder and then you pour it over or if you're using an espresso machine you have to be cleaning the espresso machine and there's all this stuff i almost said espresso and that would have been completely embarrassing i said espresso but it sounded like i said espresso and that would just ruin this whole video she made cool coffee great oh but she said espresso i'm not [ __ ] buying it like this is some of the best cold war i've ever had and i've genuinely been drinking this every day for quite a while now and it's been really hard for me not to talk to you guys about it i'm trying to think there's anything else that i wanted to say i'm really bad at doing videos where i just talk the whole time because i have not a good attention span and so i just kind of go all over the place and then i forget like everything i wanted to say this is basically my first time ever creating a business in a sense or like creating a company and it was kind of an interesting process because it's something that i'd never done or pictured myself doing but it was a really really cool experience and so you know what let's talk about a little bit i won't go into all the gruesome boring details when it came to the name of the company chamberlain coffee the reason i wanted to name it kind of in a sense after myself is because i feel like coffee has always been a big thing in my family i just wanted to keep the name simple chamberlain coffee it is and then when it came to figuring out the specific roasts that i wanted to do i learned a lot about where coffee's grown affects the flavors that is in the coffee and how you know mixing different roasts can create a new flavor and all this type of stuff so i took some time to learn about that and i basically just did a big tasting i just tasted a bunch of coffees hot cold smelled them and i just basically did process of elimination i was like well i don't really like this one because of this and i don't like this one because of this now like this one because of this and then i don't like this one because of this and after a few hours we came up with this the coffee has notes of chocolate cherry and nuts which are some of my favorite things i love chocolate of course because i'm not an idiot i love cherry i've always loved cherry flavored things although it doesn't like taste like cherries and it tastes like nuts because i love nutty coffee that's my absolute favorite thing of all time and it's a medium roast and it's delicious this is my baby good night you know after tasting all the coffee coming up with this exact roast we designed the packaging which i think turned out really really cool i'm obsessed with it we decided we want to do mugs so we're gonna be selling mugs with this you know we made the website and now it's party time basically i'm just super excited that i was able to create this exact product i feel like coffee is something i've always shared with my close friends and family you know what i mean like it's something that i've always made very sacred with the people that i love in my life like going to get coffee with my family or friends or any loved one has always been something that's been so sacred to me or even making coffee with those people you guys are very important people to me in my life and so in a sense this is our coffee bonding in a weird way because you're not here in my house with me to make coffee instead we can be drinking the same cup do you know what i mean i think that's kind of cool so if you're interested chamberlaincoffee.com you can follow the instagram it's chamberlain coffee and i think that's basically it i just wanted to i just threw up i'm just so excited that i can finally share this with you this is the most proud of something i've ever been it's just really cool and it's something that i genuinely use every day and coffee is just such a big part of my life and i'm just so i need to shut up i need to shut up if you kind of want to know what makes this like special in a sense number one this bag is nitro sealed which keeps the coffee super fresh which is important to me because flavorless coffee might as well be pee pee you know what i mean the coffee is also roasted in california and i've actually been to the roasting what do they call it like a roasting room i've seen the process happen it's just really cool to watch because they are really precise with it and i feel like they just do an incredible job it's a very unique experience i think in comparison to most instant coffees in a sense although i don't feel like this is instant coffee i don't even know how to explain it y'all just gotta try it if you want i'm gonna shut up now i've talked about everything okay guys i need to leave you alone i need to leave you alone so you can get back to your day chamberlaincoffee.com go check it out if you want i love you guys so much thank you for always supporting me with everything that i do and i hope that if you try this out you enjoy it and i hope that even if you don't try it out you still have a bomb ass day a bomb ass day that's disgusting i used to say that in like middle school like bomb ass day you know uh anyway all right that's all that's all i got to do that's all i gotta say okay good night it's 11 a.m um good morning i don't know cheers you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-12-19T21:00:36Z,239790,5417015,9305,[Music] [Applause] you can tell by my face that it's 3 a.m. I bet here's the thing recently it's been winter as you guys probably know for some reason every year during winter time I can't sleep I can't fall asleep until like 5 a.m. every night and then I wake up at like 11 a.m. and then I feel like a loser and then I'm depressed the whole winter and then winter ends and then it's summer and then I'm like and then it becomes winter again and then the cycle continues until death death I think that's probably gonna just keep happening until I die eventually but we're here we're alive we're living and it's winter because of my inability to sleep I've been watching a lot of take talk hours and hours of take top let's see how much I use tick-tock in a week let's guess how many hours you guys think I was on take top this week it's actually not as bad as I thought well you can't see it so I'm just gonna [ __ ] myself the reason why it says I only spent 3 hours and 22 minutes on takeoff this week which seems low to me is because there's only been 2 days this week so far because it's Tuesday when I'm filming this so actually I probably spend more like 15 hours a week on tick-tock do you see I'm saying I was a huge hater of tick-tock I did not get it and I'm sorry I've changed I love it now I think it's my passion not making them but watching them if you don't know a lot about tick-tock I'm sorry but I can't explain it to you because it's just too much there's too much going on there's so many different genres there's so many different areas of content there's so much different there's so much content one of my favorite take top genres is dancing take talks I love watching them and there's something satisfying about watching somebody dance I don't know why it's just like kind of soothing almost like ASMR it's like the new ASMR I'll insert one right here if you don't if you need an idea it's 3:00 a.m. right now I well is it 3:00 a.m. fluency yeah it's 3:00 and I couldn't go to sleep and I was watching tic TOCs and I decided that I would learn tic toc dances and funny story I actually already learned one before I turned on my camera but then I decided before I learn more I need to film this like I can't just not document this experience so this is the one I learned earlier and I think I should perform it for you guys to give this video kicked off with a bang the only problem is I can't include the music in this video or also don't get copyrighted so this is just gonna be basically a silent film I will insert music over me dancing to make things a little bit less awkward you're not gonna be able to hear their original music which honestly is the whole point like that's literally the whole reason why these dances are good is because they go with this song so well so like now that I'm filming this video I realize how pointless it is because it's not the same cuz you're not gonna be able to hear the music but I'm still gonna do it anyways let's do our first take talk dance that I learned I [ __ ] it up already [Music] wait I [ __ ] it up I keep [ __ ] it up I literally already learned the city let me do this so that was the teach Afghans I learned I prompt that I probably did a bad job let me do one more just in case [Music] the thing is that was really tough for me to dance to because I didn't have music I might need to use the music while I'm learning and then we'll just mute it so the first tik-tok we're gonna be learning because i already knew that one but we're gonna learn the renegade dance which is one of the most popular take dog dances that i've ever seen everybody was doing this for a while there okay let's watch this together and decide how I'm gonna do [Music] okay this is gonna be [ __ ] hard okay so I already off to a strong start let's try that again [Music] okay I'm having trouble I'm having trouble this one there's a lot of moves there's a lot going on here okay honestly all take time dances are like a little bit sexual like in every to talk to have this in every take time anything too bad in every chick talk dance there's like a you don't need this videos gonna get to monetize also look at my sweat pants like this is where we're at right now let's try this again [Music] reading okay kind of gone at that time that was actually kind of good that was okay wait I was close that time I'm taking my shoes off I'm literally gonna focus okay almost there like literally I've done this like 50 times okay this is my final performance guys let me know how it goes okay and they're trying to do it without watching the video so we'll see how this goes [Music] okay I'm doing in my eyes closed so like give me some slack here but let me turn one more time because I think I [ __ ] it out [Music] I'm tapping out I'm tapping up because I feel like that one has run its course and I have done what I can and and there's like no way of doing better than what I did although I do kind of want to try one more time nope I'm over it I'm so over that one I'm over it okay this is the next one we're doing easy okay I'm gonna change her move because I then she goes like this but I don't like that cuz I think that's too nice and I want to like beat the [ __ ] up I'm gonna get tomorrow [Music] [Music] I'm getting there [Music] my neighbors are gonna call the [ __ ] police they're gonna be like who killed her well take top dances because I think I just got it let's see if it let's see if I got it okay I got it but then they got so excited that I got it that I stopped dancing yes now it's time for the final performance no I'm literally a toddler when I don't get these right like I get so upset [Music] I'm done put that one over that one but that one was fun actually I enjoyed that one now on to the next let's watch the next one okay this one doesn't seem too bad this is like similar to the last one I feel like just give me a few minutes you know what I mean where's like the first one the renegade one I'm sorry but that one's like [ __ ] serious choreography for like Britney Spears background dancers and like I just am not there yet so [Music] why are we doing this why am I doing this why done I got that one but I'm still gonna do it again okay so this next one is you're supposed to do it with like two people but I'm by myself all right let's watch our next challenge see [Music] easy it's not gonna be as cute by myself though so Dec we want to do this with me not funny joke I'm just gonna start now [Music] that was so easy I'm done I'm gonna try again though I think I'm done alright you know what I paid my respects to all the Tik Tok dancers I learn their dances and now I kind of think that it would be fair if I actually made my own tik tok dance in honor of this video i will choose copyright free music [Music] [Music] okay so that was my first take talk dance attempt do you guys learn that send me it the song is called playful you can find it on iMovie I'm actually gonna make another tik tok dance because I feel like one is not enough I just feel like this would be good for me to give back to my community by giving you guys take talk dances to do that are slightly more advanced for the advanced crowd only ok give me a second to unwind ok I'm done sorry I just needed really catch my breath you know anyway I had a lot of fun you know what and I'm tired now like I actually think I should go to bed so maybe every night before bed I'm just gonna start making tape dog dances anyway well thank you guys - well thank you to all the tick stalkers that made up those dances things I can have fun at 3 a.m. yeah let me know if you guys learn to take talked dances that I made I would really hope that you would because let's just peed myself a little bit sneezing anyways but yeah I'm gonna go to bed now so follow me on tik tok got in the Chamberlain or don't have a great day if you want or night wherever whatever or morning [ __ ] it be yourself alright bye [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-12-01T20:57:36Z,159431,3351966,6184,[Music] [Applause] hey guys [Music] here's what's that so I'm in New York I've been in New York for a few days now it's been okay I Love New York all right I like every time I come here it's just a blast all right I love it here I'm getting over a cold when I first got here I was like pretty sick and let's just say like I had like four mental breakdowns not only was I sick but also it's like 30 degrees here hence why I'm wearing this jacket inside um yeah but New York has been great now I'm finally like not really sick anymore I think it's because LA makes me sick because I hate it so much but like New York cures me and my problems because I love New York and I'm gonna move here if people don't tell me it is not thank you to the real real for sponsoring this video by the way I love you guys I've never been in New York when it's been cold before in it's like even better like I love the cold weather I say that now but I'd probably take that back if I moved here but anyway so here's the plan this is my last night in New York I leave tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. and I decided I'm not going to sleep tonight and you're probably like why and that is because I want to sleep on the plane okay and if I want to sleep on the plane I can't sleep right now because then I won't sleep on the plane and honestly sleeping on the plane is more important than getting good night's sleep in my opinion so we're pulling an all-nighter we're pulling in New York all-nighter and I'm already bored the first thing I would decided I wanted to do um is right behind me and it's I want to try some of the hotel snacks I already ate dinner but the hotel snacks back here look very enticing and interesting to me so to start out all our art okay so to start out our all-nighter let's try some of these weird hotels next because normally hotels not actually like pretty normal but like these are kind of weird so the first snack is a vegan beef jerky look he smells good oh what the [ __ ] you yeah I just definitely not a fan of that I've never had real beef jerky so I can't tell you if that tastes like normal beef jerky but I'm gonna give this vegan beef jerky a three out of ten and the only reason why it doesn't have a zero out of ten is because the smell is really kind of good okay let's see what else is in here why this is Hotel of the weirdest [ __ ] snacks like no hotel has snacks like this crispy almond butter Brussels sprout crackers what the [ __ ] is that I actually love Brussels sprouts let's oh let's try it this tastes nothing like almond butter so I don't know why it says almond butter on me I love Brussels sprouts don't get me wrong but like there's just no reason for them to be dried up like this and I just can't I just can't stand behind I wasn't one out of ten sorry okay next they have an emergency packet I actually think that could probably come in handy for me [Music] guys don't don't ever [ __ ] Oh next we have this probiotic health bar looks good and I was right this is a 9 out of 10 can't get enough of that bone Apple tick I'm gonna go see if I can find anything interesting to do I don't know where to go I'm going up to the 20th floor for no reason also my acne is really bad right now and it's making me self-conscious but that's okay oh my god look what I just found okay so no one's out here but that was so awkward oh my god that's loud word and I went to go into the gym and I'm like filming and then this guy's like sitting lifting weights and he's like when I was like oh this is a great thumbnail thumbnail check okay let's get out of here I'm done exploring my hotel like that was enough I don't need to do this anymore so now what no no I'm back in my room oh oh that was amazing I literally was like oh let me just do a little cartwheel in the hallway never hurt nobody then someone came oh my god that was mortifying I need to start thinking of some things I could do that won't get me in trouble okay so I can't think of anything to do that won't get me in trouble while I try to think of what I should do let's talk about today's sponsor which is the real real thank you to the real real for sponsoring this video the real real is a luxury consignment store / app where you can buy and sell luxury goods that are used and it's just a great situation I bought two of my favorite bags that I have right now from the real real even though they're used I know that they're real and I got my money's worth because a real real authenticates every single item that they sell real real sells literally so many different brands Louie Vuitton my favorite and lots of other ones so you have lots of options whatever you're feeling or whatever you want if you're interested in the real real

world for sponsoring this video I appreciate you guys and I appreciate you guys and go check it out link in the description you know the drill all right back to the video ok so I've decided I need to start doing some activities that won't get me in trouble as we just seen I have had some pretty bad luck I guess I could like pack my suitcase [ __ ] I was in New York for like three days two or three days and I packed like two or three outfits cuz I was like you know that seems about fair I only wore one of the outfits that I brought and you know what outfit it was these gray sweatpants this turtleneck and a big puffy jacket over top really really important hack for packing if you want to save rooms where your dog Martin's on the plane don't ever pack your dog cartons because not only are they really heavy but they're also huge I know that I just talked about moving to New York all the time and I only never do it you know and everyone's like Emma moved to New York every single time that I come here I'm like this much closer so just give me a few more New York trips in allmovie it's so much more interesting I like the cold weather food I kind of where we like the loneliness I'm gonna regret saying that I'm gonna move here really um so lonely let's do this this is the moment of truth I'm [ __ ] sweating I don't know if I can [ __ ] close this oh my god I'm straight-up going to bed if things don't get more fun soon sometime is Pat oh hi some time has passed and I'm bored so I thought I'd go outside and take a stroll but because we're in New York and it's like 30 degrees or probably like 20 right now we need to load up on the clothes so long I just spent the last like 20 minutes why do I keep doing that I want to see if there's any like diners open ooh coffee added under let's see all right that'll be kind of fun I mean I don't really have anything I want to do in there I mean maybe I order a coffee that could be nice I look so ugly in New York but that's why I like New York this is me this is me all right and I'm putting on my glasses just to make things I've Lear Oh things have never been worse we're ready got my ring key okay so you know they say that New York is the city that just never sleeps and honestly it does not feel like it's 3:00 a.m. right now and it smells so good what smells so [ __ ] good I do feel nervous that I'm being judged and I am a little scared but it seems like everybody's just kind of like out and about and I've so good so let's go get some diner food he it's so cool how in New York you can just walk everywhere like I just

lot and then I got bored of my own life I feel like my life has changed so much I was like you know what why don't I just try to vlog a day in my life these days you know and today I have an extremely busy day I mean it's not that bad but it feels busy to me okay oh [ __ ] I forgot to bring oh no okay I have to go home I forgot something out okay I'm literally about to tell you what I forgot and it's so embarrassing oh there's a dog running in the middle of street no no no no no one hit this dog it was literally just a dog running in the middle of an intersection that was currently that was awful anyways I always forget to bring shorts to wear just in case that we try on skirts because I don't want those people looking at my vagina you know I mean well not they would be looking at my vagina but it's like awkward from like wearing my underwear like it's better if I'm wearing like little shorts or something so I need to go get that [ __ ] I'm so stupid and now I'm gonna be late ah okay now we can go thank you God and Jesus I reorganized my entire closet last night which was literally incredible like I'm so happy with the results that's why I'm tired okay it's not just cuz I was out on the town I don't do that I wanted to get ma up potentially before my fitting or coffees I like to start my day with matcha and then I drink coffee later in the day when I need a real pick-me-up but um I don't think I'm that time so I'm just gonna freaking cry now I'm gonna drink this now that's been in my car for probably a week mmm it tastes like it's been in here for a week I want to listen to music and you guys wouldn't be able to do that with me because of copyright so bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye I don't know how to daily vlog anymore I'm here although parking I just can't park I'm driving like an idiot everybody's really so annoyed with me right now all right let's do this finish like this one I have the second log on but I think we we like the first two that we tried on so the world leader I'm gonna do today which is great oh [Music] [Music] I've been drinking so much matcha recently because I feel like I think I really just like the color of it cuz it's just such a pretty green color I don't even think I like matcha that much actually I do filming my whole day made me realize that I really don't do anything interesting it's just kind of like minorly stressful minorly like it's just boring but I mean I'm gonna keep filming right that's what youtubers do hey guys I'm in the bathroom if you're okay it's fine what are you gonna do I have my podcast session in a few minutes but I have to get [ __ ] so I'm in the bathroom let me finish this I'm gonna be like rocket finishes so that I can just throw it away and be done okay I can't finish it

jeez you can get it on Spotify iTunes or anywhere else you get your podcast link in the description hi guys welcome back to stupid genius I'm Emma Chamberlain this is stupid genius and my name is Emma anyways me my two girlfriends were all like attracted to such different types of guys like we all have such a different types and why are we all friends with each other like and why do we like like different types of guys it's like why does that why's that that way anyway I was talking about that to my dad and then I was like and he was like stupid genius and I was like [ __ ] you're so right I cause like a base on my own like person like okay I'm turning my camera off now bye also look how cool this is they put me my leave of my logo up on the TV anywho bye guys hi now I'm going to a dermatologist appointment today is just so fun so basically I go to the dermatologist like once every few months just to see what I should be doing for my skin because if you didn't know that [ __ ] got acne it's getting better you see a lot worse so my bag me is like completely cleared although I did you know you can't see I'm also so hungry I'm starving the question is do I go grocery shopping everyday just post me you know what I'm saying again boy I had a trip in like a week so I should probably not go grocery shopping you know because everything will rock right now I just don't want it go grocery shopping it could be fun to go very uh adulting be like this vlog is so boring him so sorry I was like hey maybe I'll be fun to show what I do in a day this is boring as hell okay my dad's calling me honey [Applause] usually in gasps what did I just do I knock that over I just wanted to look at this skin diagram that's in acne as you can see here's a real-life demonstration look at the view I'm so hungry James Caird the doctor is gonna come in and be like what the [ __ ] are you doing it's been a few minutes I'm getting bored [ __ ] okay listen now [ __ ] stupid yep so I parked in this parking garage and it's cash only and I only have credit cards in credit cards don't work at the ATM unless you like call your credit card company so my mom's calling my credit card company and we're gonna try to get this fixed but for now I'm stranded in this parking garage and it's not okay also I wanted to work out today like 6:30 but now I don't want to anymore because I'm just [ __ ] I'm drained [Music] I am NOT going grocery shopping today okay I really should actually or should I do I have to I'm my own mom now that I moved out so like I can kind of choose these things okay so I'm currently walking to a bank so that I can get cash out but because I only have credit cards you can only get cash out at an actual bank so I have to walk to a bank now I don't know what my closest bank would be so I'm a [ __ ] mess I've been trying to ask people if they would then if I get been with them for twelve dollars cash everyone has said either I don't have venmo or I don't have cash all of which I've been lying but I also understand because they probably think I'm trying to steal from them so let's see if I can ok wait there's a bank later Lee down the street sorry okay I'm walking to go to the bank I'd be able to deal with this if I wasn't so hungry but I'm [ __ ] starving so in this lady staring at me great okay wish me luck I did it I'd like to thank not only God but Jesus and also my mom because she called my bank and asked if they could get I could get cash with my credit card and she did this I would be dead without her and I would be nothing so now let's go get food or go to the grocery store or something just anything but I just need to get out of this [ __ ] parking garage I've been trying to get out of this parking garage for two hours actually it's been like a half hour but still feels like two hours okay bye thank God huh guys I got my car back literally the poor woman that was working valet probably thought that I was psychotic not only do I not have the cash to pay for parking I was also begging everybody to give me cash in exchange for venmo like that was a lot oh now it's five o'clock I wanted to work out it oh it's dark great [ __ ] great do I just skip a day no I don't okay I'm working out unless I don't really want to so what do I do I need to like read my horoscope right now and just see why all of these things are happening

grocery shopping anymore cuz [ __ ] grocery shopping okay I don't need to be doing that oh I need to call my mom and tell her that I'm good success we're done I'm out of the garage that was one of the most wrestled things has ever happened to me but Bank was six hundred feet away it was like it's three-minute was it was a lot just keep doing what I'm doing he also the crush on me no no I'm kidding but he always comes in he's like how's her beautiful things I'm like well and then he's like talking to me and he's like you know I'm like oh my mom didn't know I was filming that conversation so that's kind of awkward but whatever it felt like a violation could she sue me I am so hungry I'm just gonna eat tic tacs until until I can get home and eat this will tide me over okay it's 5:30 p.m. and it's pitch-black out so let me turn lights on apparently I need to eat right now I'm [ __ ] losing my marbles I want to find a fun granola but I'm running out this way I need to go grocery

I'm not I don't know I don't know hold on look what I did yesterday so my dad built this for me yesterday and so I moved my workout clothes into this little room so I just went into the closet

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-11-07T20:47:32Z,303212,5354706,16161,[Music] [Applause] oh hey guys [Music] solicit um oh my god I'm uncomfortable saying this I feel like I'm telling my like parents something about my life I like this guy okay I don't [ __ ] sorry that's all so I like this guy okay and he skates like he skateboards oh he's like so this is so stupid okay okay I'm like embarrassed okay so I like this guy any skateboards okay and he's good I don't know how good he is but I know these skateboards right and like listen I'm not going to add in my life change for a guy like if a guy doesn't like me for who I am then hit the road [ __ ] but like okay how cool would it be if I could skateboard because then it would impress it in the lease like I don't care I don't care like that is not that can't be a deal-breaker it won't be it can't be that's just not allowed but it would be cool if I could would it make him like me more probably not he probably wouldn't care actually but I think it would be cool if I could skateboard just a little bit to impress it because you know what even though I don't usually well that's not sure okay we're human if we like like somebody or something you want to impress them so today I'm gonna try to learn how to skateboard to impress ah to impress okay I can't say it here's the deal I don't have I have a skateboard I actually have a bunch of skateboards but they're all penny boards which are like those plastic skateboards that like middle schoolers use so have a bunch of those but they don't have any real skateboards so in order to learn how to skateboard properly I need to get an actual skipper okay I can skateboard I know how but I just like him not I want to get better so that I can like I mean how cute would it be like skater right sorry I just okay I don't know why I'm just one of those [ __ ] [ __ ] it just likes ski like imagine like me being like oh I only like skater boys but I can't even like I don't even have my own skateboard like that just seems like wrong to me so let's go to a skate shop let's go let's do this yes okay I feel like first I need to get like a coffee or something cuz I did some like bored no not bored but like I I just want to get a coffee or something so maybe let's go do that first do I need to do that I've already had a lot of caffeine today like maybe that's not a good idea do you know what I'll hold off maybe later okay I'm a little bit nervous about going into this skate in to this skate shop I mean I know that they probably they're not judging me and they're not gonna be like why are you in here but then again like if they're like so like what brings you in here today imma be like you know what this isn't completely out of left field because I do love penny boarding got it this is not the first time that I've like done something like this I think I've already told the story before so I'm gonna make it quick cuz I know I've told her before I liked surfer boys when I was younger still loved surfer boys sorry I'm such an annoying [ __ ] everybody has their thing that like that he like that like that's a good attractive thing you know like that's normal [ __ ] you I feel like you're judging me and I know you're not baby when I was younger I like this kid and he was from Hawaii and he surfed and he always was wearing like surf clothes and I thought it was so cool and so one day I wore Roxy the surf brand Capri sweatpants and I wore them to school to impress him and he didn't care I was like hey look at my pants I don't think cool and he was like yeah sure dude I was like [ __ ] ah so that's probably what's gonna happen now I'm like gonna be like hey want to let go skate and that no I'm not even gonna talk about this I'm already uncomfortable I'm cringing I'm literally having heart palpitations right now I don't know I'm really intimidated by like by skaters how weird is that why you my like that because obviously you know I'm a big Yelp user okay so I yelled skate shops and the closest one is still far away so I don't know why where are the skate shops in my area hello maybe I'll open one once I become a pro skater okay not funny I yelped in the skate shop I'm going to it looks like it's run by an old man and I'm not as intimidated by old men so I'm just scared that I'm gonna get in there and it's gonna be like a [ __ ] leg kid my age like I just can't handle that I have like a regular phone like a regular uncracked fully functioning phone for maybe a week and then I crack it again I cracked my phone probably two months ago finally replace my screen took me months to do it because I'm just a piece of [ __ ] and I'm so lazy and that's why my mom screams at me every day on the phone about how I don't do things correctly then I cracked my phone again I drop my phone onto a rock I don't know if you can tell but I'm driving so I can't show you details but yeah correct my phone again so at this point I think it's safer for me to just live with a cracked phone I've had my phone cracked for a month and I just don't want to change it I don't care and do you know why I don't give a [ __ ] about the new iPhone either sorry I don't care I kind of want it okay I'll see you at the stage huh see this let's see this thing right [Music] guys I got it I was really nervous in there because I felt like I was gonna be judged and in the beginning I was very nervous cuz I felt like I was being judged but then as he was making as the guy was making my board he was actually really sweet so that was really good experience here's my board now if you're wondering what's on the back Emma what kind of board did you get I got a rigging I got a Rick and Morty skateboard okay because I don't watch a lot of TV I don't watch a lot of shows I was in a Napoleon Dynamite one that would have been very iconic but they didn't so whatever oh I forgot to get a helmet it's fine I'm not gonna do any crazy tricks so I'll be okay I'm probably just gonna [ __ ] sit on this and roll around on it literally knowing me I love Rick and Morty and I didn't really like any of the other designs because I don't know any skate Branson none of them like resonated with me so I was like Rick and Morty skateboard and I had to get the pickle Rick won even though it's like the most basic choice it was just kind of funny because the whole board is the pickle you know she was this key oh he can't sing cuz I'll get covered okay step one down we got our skateboard now now what two skateboarders drink coffee the guy in there was actually so nice that was really really a good experience it takes forever for them to make the board for you you know but you did a great job I guess honestly I don't really know it what it takes to do a good job making a skateboard how the [ __ ] would I know anyway let's head home and then I need to find a place to skate because yeah where am I gonna skate I'm not going to a [ __ ] skate park that's for damn sure I'm back okay I'm back I got my pickle Rick now we need to actually skate it on it which is like the scary part cuz I literally don't skate on normal skateboards like ever but I feel like my outfit does it I need to dress the part so I can embody my inner skater Oh skater transformation Here I am wait you wanna beat I feel like I've talked enough skater boys instagrams to kind of know how to dress like one I'm sorry again now that I'm a skater boy I love breaking bitch's hearts let's go skate somewhere I don't know where we gonna go we're two skateboarders go I'm not going to a [ __ ] skate park not going to skate park okay [Music] I'm sure to learn some tricks that was cool [Music] I don't know like what else do I do like I just skated like for a while like what else the skater boys do besides like break girls hearts my guy obviously can't do a [ __ ] kickflip like what do you want me to do oh [ __ ] okay honestly I'm not that bad at skateboarding I feel like I could at least impress someone with my efforts oh wait I need to get thumbnail okay that's a good enough time oh my god my neighbors just got home and I'm in my garage I need to go into the elevator now because this is too embarrassing hold on all right oh I'm taking my beanie off cause it's making my forehead sweat so anyone else have that problem like my forehead sweat sweat cheese my forehead sweats and itches when I wear beanies most the time unless it's like a really good beanie so anyway one leg equals one achieve forehead with the after beanie post beanie post beanie itchy forehead one like equals that so everybody gives it a thumbs up I don't want you guys to think and the tree just for boys hooray don't buck and don't ever do that the guy wants you to change for them don't ever [ __ ] talk to them again whoever's watching this don't change for your significant other in general okay it's just not don't do that yeah thanks for watching hope you guys had fun I definitely had fun and I got a cool new skateboard out of it so I think we're all winning Declan why do you always make sounds at the worst times like you don't need to be making sounds right now all right um I love you guys don't change ever for anyone I mean skateboarding is fun so like might as well try it right I love you guys stay awesome stay cool stay yourself be yourself love yourself you know the [ __ ] drill all right bye guys bye guys oh I have an idea all right guys peace out goodbye [Music]

-emma chamberlain",2019-10-31T20:00:13Z,201454,4783471,5655,[Music] [Applause] Hey [Music] hi I'm in bed I'm having a stressful day so I thought that I would film my intro in bed just so that I could be more relaxed you know feel like I'm having a why am i venting like you guys are my therapist um well maybe you want wait this is the most chill Declan has been in like months declan's going through his teen phase and he's just been super violent with me like I wake up - Declan trying to like rip my skin off I think it's just his team phase but right now he's being so sweet so let's just cherish this moment cuz it's probably not gonna happen again as I was saying I've had a rough two days like I swear to God like just things keep happening that are so stressful it's fine um because guess what Halloween it's coming okay Halloween is in a few days oh my god he smells so good basically I feel like when you get older like okay when you're younger it's like okay one costume that's it you dress up one day and it's on Halloween and then that's it the older you get I feel like the more costumes you need because there's more events there's more fun opportunities once you get older like there's it's like Halloween not Halloween Daniel I really like Halloween because it's not like I go trick-or-treating anymore on Halloween parties are like how Halloween parties are not very fun but I do like dressing up but the thing is I don't prepare I plan my costumes literally the night before my first Halloween party that I get to go to is tomorrow and I don't have a costume not to mention I don't have any costumes yet not one costume I have 24 hours to come up with at least one costume but ideally I might come up with more that's what we're doing today and I don't really want to go shopping because right now is like the prime time I'm gonna try to find Halloween costumes with stuff that I already have in my house and I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do but I have a few ideas so we'll see what we can do what's being so cute though I don't really want to get up oh my god make a dress up as Declan if I dress up as Declan I just look like a basic cat costume that everyone does every year so I'm not gonna do that oh my god look at that oh he's a youtuber oh my god I raised him so well okay let's see what we can find okay I'm in my closet and I'm just gonna start looking for stuff see this skirt this could be like a sailor costume like if I dressed up it's like a sailor is this like a sailor hat nope okay wait is this like a sailor hat no that's like a train conductor what what did my hats just sailors wear wait maybe I could do a train conductor that's stupid okay oh wait this is like a beret wait is this like it's is this like a I can use this beret for something okay I'm gonna put this aside okay I have these like chubby shorts like these remind me of like a frat boy I could try to dress up as a frat boy so I'm gonna put what kind of shirts two frat boys wear I didn't go to college really good college boy would wear something like this oh wait that's perfect do I have like a I could put backwards no way oh my god I have this [ __ ] Vineyard Vines a hat stop that I've only a frat boy for Halloween I have like the perfect [ __ ] costume oh my god I could be Dwayne Johnson wait there's this picture of Dwayne Johnson and I literally like have everything I need but he's wearing a fake I found a black fanny pack it has the YouTube logo on it but mine as well represent right no YouTube what if I did like um somebody who's on vacation because I have this shirt and I have this hat so I could be like someone on vacation like I have these like kind of cargo okay perfect three costumes done how am i doing such a good job look at these glasses I have so I have like these and these now what do these Ramat these are Elton John is [ __ ] so I could dress up as Elton John but what else does he wear I need to do research oh my god wait he's wearing a plaid matching set wait I think I have something like that wait how do I already have like four costumes already I'm like already done that was like so easy I was like this video is gonna take seven years to film and then I'm done wait okay literally I have this blazer okay and I have the matching pants but like the question is am I gonna actually wear any of these like I'm probably gonna end up like on Halloween I'm gonna be like I actually hate all these they feel like Halloween you gotta like look cute too like so you're trying to like look cute wow also have like a good costume so it's like a balance Elton John okay oh [ __ ] that was not chill at all I could be Paris Hilton why am I just dressing up as people have this Von Dutch bag which is what Paris Hilton used to wear a Paris Hilton had like the most iconic like style ever and I want to see if I can this that's a good start I feel like this is kind of Paris Hilton maybe she's never gonna watch this but if she does she's gonna be like I mean you did a terrible job and I'm gonna be like I know I'm sorry yeah that's [ __ ] true religion jeans I mean it's like I was made for this okay let's go upstairs and see if I can find anything else I have this pregnant belly from one item could I leave somebody who's pregnant I could be Kylie Jenner from when she was pregnant that could work okay I have this time maybe I could be the president like a president I could be like a president not anyone in particular just like a president or maybe a senator or a mayor oh I have this flower crown maybe I could be like a Coachella Queen oh wait I already am mad at Coachella that's a joke wait oh my gosh drive up the whole cabin here oh my god I could be [ __ ] tie you hold on I could be Caillou wait this is the bag hold on if I'm Caillou wait that's the best option if I can do that this is like my my costume box oh my god these are perfect for my Paris Hilton costume doing this is going so well oh my god a we I have way more wigs I thought holy [ __ ] wait I could be my grandma her hair is exactly like that okay I have a red wig too oh wait you know where this last year so can I like not do that again like is that not allowed weed wife caddy or declan well they're black so I can't be declan with these also being a cat is so overdone I have a short hair wig this could come in handy happy Halloween I could be a middle schooler remember when everyone plays a middle school oh my [ __ ] okay wait I literally just found so much good [ __ ] now I'm going to try all the outfits on and see if any of them look any good [Music] [Applause] [Music] I kind of snapped on this one like this looks like Elton John kind of I don't know if I wear this SOB's I don't think it's that flattering but like hey the thought was there hold me closer tiny dancer [Music] again we I killed this one you know what update you wouldn't like go to Sigma Pi later I don't know I don't I didn't go to college [Music] Oh sorry I'm not gonna dance like that okay Paris Hilton this I did this I might look he do this at the party tomorrow sorry Paris Hilton am i you yet the VATS hot is that what she says [Applause] I kind of did nail this one but actually I could also look like a school principal so this costume is quite flexible depending on who you want to be I would never wear this though this is like really ugly and I would definitely be made fun of if I wear this in public [Music] this next one is my grandma and I actually know what he did kind of nail this costume I mean it's pretty easy if you guys want to be my grandma at home she just has hair like this and so you could pretty much be her if you wanted she wears lots of different kinds of clothes so you could just wear a wig like this and then you could be my grandma crab pie if you're watching this I love you so much I might be you for Halloween I'm Caillou okay this is incredible actually the bald cap does not look good and I don't know how to put on a bald cap that was my [ __ ] favorite show as a kid like this is so nostalgic and Q of how you feeling I killed this I love this look to it I would just wear this anyways like this is a [ __ ] look Dwayne the rock you were on to something I don't even think I want to wear this as a costume I think I just want to wear this little YouTube represent you feel me I literally tried on every costume idea I had in the only one that I liked was Paris Hilton but I feel like I wasn't doing your dresses with the outfit I picked out so I'm kind of like [ __ ] so far and literally I have my Halloween party tomorrow and I'm [ __ ] so this is so ugly but it's kind of funny but like this would be funny like if I was like it was like it jokowi Marty but like I want my costume to be taken relatively seriously and this is not but if you want to do this that's fine I actually think it's kind of it's kind of Awesome please tell me that in like 2013 you remember the girls that used to hold up like I was this girl okay but maybe this was like just me and like then this whole entire costume makes no sense but there was girls that were on like tumblr or like we hard eight or like Pinterest whatever that would like or even Instagram and they would like be wearing flower crowns and cute little pastel colors and they would be like look at my baby lips please tell me I did not keep this [ __ ] baby lips for nothing it smells like [ __ ] and I just put on my lip oh that's bad surprise and shiny I need to reassess because although that was quite fun and trying to find a Halloween costume in my own house it was a great idea in theory and it should have worked but it didn't so let's go reassess in my bed cuz I am stressed out now and we need a talk I did just spend two hours trying to come up with a Halloween costume in my house and you know what I think I got some good ideas that maybe you can use hopefully I wasn't satisfied with any of them like they didn't float my boat and I'm just like not except like they just weren't good enough I might end up having to use them I don't know okay I actually don't know I literally am [ __ ] because I literally have a Halloween party tomorrow and I don't know what I'm going to wear we're all this story is number one you could definitely find all the link awesome in your house so if you are feeling the stress out like me right now you could probably find one in your house and I could be the one that proved that to you even though it didn't really work out for me but that doesn't mean it won't work out for you okay so maybe I inspired you I who knows what you got from this I don't know what I'm gonna do maybe I just won't go to the Halloween parties okay I tried um if you want to know what I end up being go my Instagram and you can see there because knowing me I'm gonna post a lot about it if I figure it out and then if you don't see me post my only costume that means I just didn't go out so please wish me luck please keep me in your prayers um I pray for me okay I'm like I don't know what I'm gonna do DUI it doesn't matter it's just Halloween alright that's it for today's video I tried it was fun it was awesome I hope you guys had fun and if you didn't whatever that's not my problem I love you guys a lot have a great day and honestly picking out those costumes help me get out of my shitty rut that I was in earlier now I don't give a [ __ ] about my problems because I dressed up as Caillou and pregnant Kylie Jenner and Elton John and my grandma so I feel good now all right I love you guys have a great day and don't be a bad person be a good person maybe it could be a tick talker for Halloween oh my creator of energies flowing or I could be like a tick-tock a boy or like a visco roll oh my god it's so trendy okay bye [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-10-27T18:55:57Z,325974,6441664,18266,[Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so one of my most common comments that I get on my videos is that so that's a majority of my comments section no I'm just kidding but I do get a lot of comments like that which is cool you know you are entitled to your opinion and I am all ears it doesn't mean it's good for my self-esteem but that's okay cuz I can handle that with my therapy a lot of people miss the old me you know I used to be blonde in like more annoying in my opinion and a lot more sad so that was the old Emma Chamberlain whatever that means now I'm apparently very different you know I grew up a little bit I moved out I moved to LA like uh in my opinion I feel like I like myself better now because I'm more myself than I've ever been so I'm pretty content with the place that I'm in you know what I mean and so those comments you know again therapist discussion that will be happening but today I'm gonna be turning myself into the old Emma Chamberlain because I'm in the city of San Francisco right now this is kind of where I grew up not really I grew up like near San Francisco but I just say grew up in San Francisco because it's like easier to say than being like oh I groups south of San Francisco and it was actually not as cool CinemaScope like I sound a lot cooler when I say group in San Francisco but I'm here and so I thought in honor of being here I would transform myself into the old me I just got this idea literally five minutes ago and I was like wait that'd be kind of funny because I'm here so like and I'm gonna get nostalgic I thought I would turn myself into the old Emma Chamberlain give you guys what you really want because this we eat this we mix the blonde really sad of a chamber so today we're bringing her back for the day don't get too comfortable because after today I'm gonna be back to this so I'm turning myself into the hold me and to get this like kicked off I ordered my old Phil's order because I get a different thing now this will make sense if you don't know what Phil's is cuz their orders are super weird like the menu is super weird but this is a large ice dancing water if you don't know what that means I don't know how to explain it now I get a Jacob's Wonder Bar with almond milk but instead of getting my current order which is a Jacob's Wonder Bar I got the dancing water it does taste nostalgic to me I used to drink that every day when I was the old Emma Chamberlain so I got that to take this off but now let's get started with the transformation I'm gonna have to like kind of dig deep because I kind of forgot who that person was although it's like the same person but like I forgot what my like what my trademark moves were so let me think and then we'll start [ __ ] clever table that Beach stop I'm in no hotel room right now and everybody's probably like who who is screaming want to know who's screaming the new Emma Chamberlain if she's [ __ ] sad I thought about it a little bit and I was like okay what did the old Emma Chamberlain do she didn't wear makeup and I'm wearing a little bit of makeup right now because I'm breaking out you know I didn't used to wear makeup I think as I was just really lazy I like makeup now you know I mean I don't wear it too often but like I dabble you know the whole damaged hair mom doesn't wear makeup so it's coming off I do like like buying makeup though and like trying out new products like I never cared about that before I don't know if that's like it's getting older thing like as you get older you start to I don't know and I also really bad under-eye bags right now like this is really severe I don't think my under-eye bags used to be as bad back in the day um in the good old days I just cannot get my [ __ ] mascara off for my life ever she's barefaced it's not it's not the cutest but step one complete makeup off now that I'm a barefaced I was singing like okay like how am I gonna turn myself into the old me cuz I still have the same face but like I have a few different traits now I definitely dress differently now I mean my style does change every week but I had like a pretty I was wearing like the same thing over and over again back in the day I like even shopped at different stores like I feel like I shop at different stores now and I just kind of like my style is a little different so I need to go shop it and they need to wait because I used to be blonde and now I'm not let's get out there [Music] our first victim no way no way victim number two [Music] okay I'm back I literally am so scared to put this outfit on right now because like I didn't just do outfit like I did it Oh like this is about to be like exact and I'm like scared to see what I look like as like my old me let's get into it I guess why why waste any more time okay so here's my outfit right now very comfortable but it's not what we want so we need to change I'm gonna do a cool transition and it's gonna be pretty sick so wha oh my god this is crazy accurate I used to just have a uniform every single day I would literally wear a fuzzy jacket exactly like this I used to wear Doc Martens implied pants in this type of jacket every single day I am literally wore this jacket every day I think I still have it I'd like my mom's house somewhere because I like didn't want to throw it away cuz I wore it so much that it like became my thing like I couldn't get rid of it but this isn't enough I used to be blonde okay but it was like kind of a blonde where like my roots were always showing like you could always see the brown it was like not I didn't keep up with my blonde because I'm not a natural blonde I just always had like half grown out blonde hair it was not really a look but whatever I couldn't just do this without getting a wig that was just like that and I had to do some searching but you'll never guess what I found y'all this is the most accurate wig I literally I [ __ ] I almost passed out on the spot this wig is insanely accurate because I always had like roots like this growing out with the blonde event I freaked out when I found this I was so excited although this hair is like a lot prettier than mine ever was like look how nice I swear to god I'm gonna put this on and want to be blonde again which is like kind of a bad thing but whatever oh why is there a lump right there guys it's the old meanie did you miss me [ __ ] you this looks awful did I like put it on wrong it like doesn't look real at all I'm trying okay oh my god I look like [ __ ] okay so now it's time to accessorize thank God I bought a beanie because yeah this wig is like just not really doing its job it's work it's just not doing a good job right now wait that kind of helped oh my god scrunchies yes visco girl oh god that word is triggering for me okay I used to [ __ ] carry around this backpack literally everywhere I went and then I ripped it or something happened to it and then I stopped so rest in peace to that backpack miss you so much thank you for all your service um and last but not least holy [ __ ] thumbnail okay this is the big reveal one two three Oh oh my god no wait I [ __ ] want mean obviously I nailed this this is like me like I'm literally just dressed up as myself wait can I be me for Halloween okay sorry that I'm like setting up my camera on the bathroom I just literally have no space in this hotel room holy [ __ ] doc this is hilarious this was me I don't really have anything else to say like I did it okay I'm gonna do this outro on my toilet because I feel like that's what old Emma would have done so here I am did you miss me I'm back guys you can't comment [ __ ] on this video about we reduced the hold em up [ __ ] she's right here okay [ __ ] that honestly I'm literally on the toilet honestly I wait what the [ __ ] is that well I can't ignore it now and now I have to fix it oh okay I almost just broke my entire camera literally I just can't get the [ __ ] camera angles right today that was fun that was funny and all but I don't miss that [ __ ] okay I have to keep growing and evolving or else I'm gonna get bored of myself I'm kind of glad that I'm I'm who I am now although these pants are actually really cute and I'm really glad I bought them so no regrets there this was fun I yeah um coming down below if you miss her I don't actually I've decided she had her time to shine we loved her and she's dead now also I think my hair looks better Brent hmm I like want to go blonde once a week but I'm not gonna do it anyway I was a literal visco girl when I was like like 2 years ago or whatever like I was a visco girl you know what do I start ranting about this okay well apparently I'm a visco girl according to the internet I would like to correct whoever said that and say that I used to be a visco girl and now I'm in a girl like wait am i an e girl now okay I stated [ __ ] in this video yo [ __ ] that [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-10-20T21:07:13Z,233164,6240038,10572,[Music] [Applause] sorry I'm dreadknot get what is that [Music] this is weird I don't [ __ ] film videos like this where I like to sit in front of a camera like I literally set up a ring light for this it's crazy I went riff shopping a lot recently and like vintage shopping thrift shopping all of that everything I've been doing a lot of that recently and I've been doing such a good job and I felt like I wanted to show you guys okay so now I'm doing a [ __ ] haul I never well I guess I do hauls sometimes but I never ah to make this video like more valuable because I feel like if I just did all you guys would be like are you kidding so I'm also gonna be showing you how I'd wear these out these pieces that I bought because I feel like that's actually useful when people just show what they bought that's like not that useful for developing your own personal style welcome to my TED talk I look like [ __ ] right now but that's fine I basically went thrifting in Europe because I was in Europe recently and I went through f---ing there and then had to bring all of it home which was not okay and then I also recently went through f---ing in LA so I'm gonna be showing you all the things I bought it's a haul and then I'm gonna be showing you how I'd style each piece this videos gonna take me six years to film and that's fine cuz I love you first thing I got first thing I got you I don't know if I can do this look at this thick jacket everything about this is so cool the pockets it's just like it smells awful that's kind of like what you sign up for that when you thrift but whatever I already wore this once although I didn't wear it on Instagram yet which means I didn't wear it because unless you wear it on Instagram you didn't wear it that's my rule it says something on it I don't really know I don't care anyway this is really cool thank you I don't know how to talk about clothes very simple all white top denim shorts so this jacket can be the statement okay because it is so many fun details it's what it deserves it deserves to speak I got this college sweatshirt that says Purdue on it and I literally don't know anything about that college I don't know where it is but I bought this cuz it's a turtleneck hoodie and I like love that when you're thrifting I feel like sometimes you'll just buy random shape because it's like so it's like three dollars so it's like why not do you know what I mean if you go to Purdue let me know comment down below how the school is let me know if I made the right decision by buying this I'm trying to be like a college girl sporty girl here just be so simple with it okay I love wearing like big sweaters like big sweatshirts with biker shorts in Air Force Ones and just being so chill next I got this sweater it's actually Tommy Hilfiger which is a score every sweater like I cannot stand Ichi sweaters and like this is not itchy at all which is why I bought it like I always test by rubbing it on my lip say one else okay I don't know how I would wear this but I'll figure that out before you see me wearing it in the next clip this sweater is kind of like boring um so I couldn't paired it with like jeans and it would have just been like super boring but I was like you know what for the sake of the video I'll wear was something a little bit funky so I have these plaid pants I feel like it kind of spices up the sweater because the sweater is just so grandpa that's what it is you know sometimes you just have to put things together that don't make sense and are probably actually ugly but at least it's unique right okay ugly this is like literally this pattern is so ugly it's so ugly but I had to buy this I feel like it was fun and I honestly I already wore it like I liked it so much I already wore it so like that's how you know this is just such like a frumpy pattern and it's so corny then I was like let me fully transform myself into that time that this would have been worn seriously to try to make it seem normal when I feel like it actually looks kind of normal I wore like these you know and kind of a city wash jeans to compliment that era of time and the Air Force Ones I just don't know whether they're shoe to wear so that's kind of just what I did my goal was to look like I was in high school like 20 40 50 years ago wait like 20 what year is it okay maybe like wait yeah like 20 30 years ago next I got red Levi's okay I don't know how I feel about these but I actually no I I do I like these a lot I just like love jeans like I have a huge jeans thing basically I think these pants are kind of they're kind of bulky and you know your big statement so I wanted to make it a little bit more flirty and fun by wearing a cropped shirt with it got the Doc Martens I like to keep things simple okay I'm a simple gal this is how I wear this I look bad right now sorry also I just like wear these shoes with everything so good luck seeing me not wearing them okay bye okay next I got literally the ugliest shirt I've ever seen why do I do that there's something about thrifting where it's like okay wait this is ugly which is why I like it it's a Carhartt like button three button-down it's so ugly oh my god my dad used to wear Carhartt pants so it's like kind of nostalgic you know um whatever I know I said that I thought I was gonna like hate this shirt because it's like kind of ugly but like with the turtleneck under it it's up it's a vibe the way that I dress like I'm not gonna [ __ ] put together outfits here that are realistic I'm putting together outfits that you could actually wear and be comfortable and next I got this red belt I'm a big wear of a shoelace belt I just like to tie a shoelace around my waist is about because I have a hard time finding belts that I like but I felt like this one was really classic it's just red okay it's not that complicated it's pretty self experience yeah see like that's cute right okay I don't know okay so here's my outfit for this belt I don't actually really like this outfit very much but I thought it kind of was cool it was a cool idea hopefully this maybe gave you belt in SPO these are so skater girl welcome to Emma trying to be a skater girl you know what though I can skateboard I like them because I feel like they remind me of Mac DeMarco this kind of just looks like a school uniform like a middle school school uniform but like a little bit fashioned version cuz this top is like cropped and you know like the red converse are probably not allowed at most schools for school uniform I don't know I don't know I'm just showing you this I don't know what came over me but I saw these and I was like wait I need them like what even type of pants are these I literally don't know why I like them so much we've Isis laid my face I'm so pissed these pants are like great like I don't know what they are because they're just like tight here of a pocket like I don't know what type of pants these are like I don't know what they are I just work with like a simple tube top because I felt like these pants were really puffy and and needed like I wanted my upper body to look smaller so I wear the tube top okay or some chunky you know Doc Martens who would've thunk it they've got another pair these are in like blue they are sick though like there's something fun about them I feel like an old lady would wear them to like a bingo match cheese pants I literally couldn't tell you like what type of pants they are but they're actually really comfortable in there kind of cool-looking so I love getting those shirts and either cropping them or getting ones that are already cropped and have this like little thing in it so that it's like you know more interesting again you could do this yourself - I've seen people on my Instagram Explorer page yeah I think this is very interesting look okay that's why I did it these pants are interesting and they deserve an interesting outfit this looks ugly right now because I am the babbly but you have to imagine this on me or on you more preferably on you when you're fully ready for the day next about brown jeans which like I don't know if that's a good decision so a lot of people will go into detail about like what they bought like you see it I don't need to go into it so basically these brown jeans we're kind of hard to find these to pair with it because even the Browns neutral it was just kind of like hard to find a color that looks good with brown so I just did black and we're good I like it when in doubt wear a mock neck and then I'm wearing these again because these are some of my favorite shoes these are creepers and they're very underrated and you know I wore them on my Instagram once and everybody was like what are those and I was like okay they're interesting okay these are so ugly I got these Asics like they're so ugly I think my style is actually like picking out stuff that I think is actually kind of hug I literally just bought these because I thought that they were like kind of cute I always thought that I'm just gonna wear them like today and like now I'm like wait maybe I'll wear them in public all right be sure it's actually really cute like the little pockets so cute yay don't take fashion advice from me honestly or maybe you know what at your own risk yeah so I got this like grandma's shirt like I actually think my grandma has this shirt like not that that's a bad thing Thanksgiving is gonna be awkward now that's like anything also I like to challenge myself like how can I make this ugly piece of clothing cute like I literally brought bought true religion jeans and like [ __ ] Von Dutch hat if you're wondering like Emma this shirt is already ugly enough why are you wearing it with like kind of borderline ugly shoes also well that's the whole point also am realizing that you like I'm not wearing made any makeup my hair is not done so like these outfits probably look 20 times like more questionable because I'm not ready also have a mirror right here and that's why I'm looking in it to see what this looks like I like the shirt it's frumpy but I like it okay this is so cool this isn't even ugly Oh like can you just like picture like Elvis wearing this I don't know if that's the right person to use for that example but I feel like this could be done differently and I like it better but I just like doing interesting come to me so this is all working when I'm wearing these like white jeans because they feel like the white wigs on the way at the top you know what I mean I tied this shirt although I would actually also tuck it in but I just felt like the time it's it kind of more I don't have an adjective to describe that Doc Martens you'll be seeing these a lot oh okay I also thrifted choose and I normally don't do this but it's actually really nice well it's kind of gross it's nice that these shoes are already worn it because like wearing and shoes takes a while and like they're not usually the most comfortable and I have sensitive skin so I was get like blisters and all that cuz I'm you know I'm human these like Nike skater blazer made sneakers I think they're the Blazer mid ones wait is that right I don't care correct me rows me I don't give a [ __ ] about these shoes I would wear something kind of like this I love me some color coordination okay so this is like that that's like that so matches and then have the denim to like break it up you know what I mean so it's not too matchy but that's how I wear this it's not very complex these would be for a very casual day they kind of make my legs look short though just so short but you know what that's okay next thing out red converse that are already there like at the perfect level of warning they look perfect like do the it's perfect are you kidding me Declan like don't do that I am NOT putting on a full outfit with red converse anything you can wear anything with these moving on somehow they had two pairs of shoes that were my size and that I liked which I've never experienced so that was like whatever I guess that's how it works in Europe I had no idea that like thrifting or vintage shopping in Europe was like that good last few things neither things I got in LA but I wanted to show you anyways because I thought they were fun and they're kind of they're in the same genre of like clothing so like why not burst oh these are so [ __ ] up these are so [ __ ] they're red jeans but look at this [ __ ] detail on this pocket that is seriously next next level I saw these and I was like yeah I'm sorry I don't even care if they don't fit me I'm gonna get them because I'm obsessed with them like those are just like I want to get a [ __ ] frame for Declan I'm serious I might have to lock him out of my room until him done filming he's being so he's trying to rip my clothes off okay sorry I'm like virtually naked but like that's this is the way I'd wear these pants so I'm not going to sugarcoat it again I just like with shoes okay I just like waiting with the shoes I just whatever I actually really like this outfit I feel like it kinda reminds me of like a pirate when you feel like a pirate would wear this like the jeans are kind of like bread you know this top is very much like a pirate Captain Jack Sparrow with like this okay that's like not in a weird way just in like a he would think he was a good outfit okay next I got these there guess look mom jeans like okay great cool now I'm gonna be [ __ ] called like who knows what I'm gonna be called for that so for these jeans um I wanted to give it kind of like a preppy look so I have this cropped sweater that is very fun with the airport whatever you get it I bought this Britney Spears shirt I'm not like the biggest Britney stand that exists but like I just think that she's such a bad [ __ ] so this is an outfit that like shouldn't exist but like it feels so right to me because it's Britney Spears B's the True Religions you know Britney would be proud of me this just feels so right to me okay and like it's so I hate it it's ugly but like it feels right fashion doesn't have to be serious all the time like if you want to wear an outfit that's like kind of funny or like a little bit weird like there's nothing wrong with that that's something I realized recently because before I would be like oh my God if my outfits not super cooled and like and that's bad but it's like no it's actually fun to like kind of wear things that are almost corny in a sense I've like found the art in that recently so okay next thing got this this is kind of like weird I've never bought anything like this before it's like a romper it is a little weird but I actually think it's kind of cool so for this like romper thing listen I'm wearing got worms with you that's not probably how I'd wear it in reality you'd actually probably wear it with something a little bit more dressy because I believe this romper is kind of dressy but I don't have any other shoes right now and I don't know like I don't literally owned anything classy so so we're working with but the main thing I wanted to show is that I tied this with a little shoelace because it needed it okay it was like really just kind of like a box before but once I tied it with the shoelace it looked really cute I wear this oh I got these this is weird - it's like an overall score and then on the back it's shorts I don't know how I feel about this but I just was like hey why not so I paired the overall dress well it's actually a score I'd wrap my hair day with a turtleneck to kind of make it a little bit it's like innocent you know it's innocent it's cute and then I added the dog learns to make it like badass so it's like for a second you like see me knees up and you're like oh she's so cute and innocent and then you see the shoe and you're like but she'll kick yo ass next we just have some light wash Levi's I have like 400 of these but I just keep buying them every time I find them because they're just so comfortable and they make my butt look better than normal although that's hard to do because it's not really there so anyways okay literally you could wear anything with these jeans sorry you can literally wear anything with these jeans they're so versatile they're so comfortable they are just so cute they're just so awesome last but not least I got this shirt that is like satiny or weight silky stop oh no okay I really could not come up with an outfit for this talk this is what I got though I don't hate it because the top is white and like kind of boring so I was leaving a long a pop of color with the green pants and then the air pours it balances out I have been trying on clothes for the past three and a half hours so I'm very I actually don't think my brain works anymore so that's why this is what we're working with I could definitely come up with something better but for some reason my brain is broken it's a lot well say bless me Declan you [ __ ] man acnes no I was about to say my acne is clearing up and then I looked

I was in Paris for Fashion Week and the food here is so good like the muesli granola that they give you is literally it's unbelievable I was like I'm so full Wow this coffee is bangin every time they brought the muesli or the granola it looks different than the last time I was here which worries me but I'm gonna try it anyway mmm yes I took a 10-minute nap well I'm waiting for my room service to show up and I had my hand in such a tight fist that my nail dug into my hand and made a cut is that normal I want to move to Paris only with food oh all right I'm gonna take a nap hi okay good morning it is the next day I'm not sure what I'm doing today I am a free day in Paris today and I don't know what I'm gonna do okay so right now I'm getting ready so I can like feel kind of cute you know

bronzer [ __ ] tomorrow is the show I have a few things I needed you to prepare for the show today but besides that I'm just gonna be super chill I'm breaking out really bad so I need I want to get a face mask so maybe we can find one somewhere here and then the other thing I need to paint my nails because basically I got my nails done with regular polish and I [ __ ] them up I don't know if you can tell but I [ __ ] up the nail polish and like I can't be going to the show tomorrow with with nails that are like ugly so I'm gonna try to get face masks and nail polish right now I'm gonna go get coffee with my dad and we're just gonna go walk around bears a little bit take an Instagram photo oh also I learned this a new move so basically recently I've been watching a lot of tape talk and if you don't know what tick tock is do your own research I don't wanna explain it but I figured out this take top move so let me know comment down below what take talk maybe I should learn next I've learned this one recently it's where you go like and let me know what you talk move to learn next because I am always open-minded in trying to learn you take top moves and I also want to make it to talk well I already have one my user name is Emma Cham B but the problem is that I'm too nervous to use it and every time I post on it I get too nervous and then I delete it I don't look [ __ ] weird I'm literally do you want to know what I do with my hair when I don't want to do it I put in a buff and that's why it's in fun I hate doing mascara because I just get it everywhere also I'm breaking out you know I just like don't look right there's something off about me anyway let's see if my dad is ready yeah take pictures you know it when your dad knows that you just want to go outside only to take in Instagram there's more than I like to do but it's just that I love putting on outfits and taking Instagram photos it's like my new thing also how I just grab something with my saree I am like acne on my back you guys know that it's so cool let's go explore Paris yo what up so my dad said that in the elevator this is a cool shot see the problem is with this elevator is that you can see my acne you see it I mean and like I don't like that but we'll figure it out that's your brand oh my dad just like straight up like wasn't looking at what do you think so like my head's not in these that's like no no that's all of them you cut out my head like Oh somebody's coming okay yeah we're leaving should we do like an artsy Paris montage or now oh my God look how bright out it is today you the Paris montage now [Music] thanks for the Instagram anytime okay good you know it's hard for me because they don't have nice coffee here so I have to drink this espresso that's so wrong it's so wrong like like the class here and like I just did that oh I think your dance montages are so expressive so passionate and do you really think so can I still order breakfast okay great um can I get an iced latte with almond milk can I get the muesli can I get that with a side of almond milk as well and then can I have hard-boiled egg a side of fruit a fruit plate is great amazing thank you yo yeah

okay I'm doing good okay let's see what I got actually I got ten face masks I don't know we'll do those later I don't know how like French skin care is it's probably really good considering I've never seen somebody here like I feel like everybody just as perfect and France so maybe that can help me um nail polish remover nail polish we know what's going on okay Oh a I also got mouthwash just cuz like I could use more lot so I'm gonna beat my nails you know what's so funny I used to be obsessed okay obsessed with doing nails like you have no idea it was like my hobby and passion okay so like I

some reason sorry I'm like capturing him right now I just want his affection you did he fart no what la is just like really sad for me a lot of the times and I would not and I'd rather not be here so ever so I want to go on a trip spontaneously for like two or three days I just wanted no creep today I'm just getting a book a flight somewhere for a few days and we're just gonna like enjoy the experience to get there how's a unit I think I want to go back to New York because I was just in New York I love it there and I want to go there right now I don't want you want to try to go to a new place because they feel like that I've never been before because I feel like that's too risky and I'm only going for a few days and like [ __ ] I want to be more spontaneous ok so this is my first step at being more spontaneous and it's gonna be really fun I'm gonna get on my computer and see if I can book this let's see what we can do okay let's see what we can find online Declan can I help use her it looks like there's a flight at 5:30 a.m. tomorrow so we're going now I need a book of hotel okay this is working out way too well I was expecting this to go bad and it didn't literally there's a perfect plate and there's availability at the hotel I like in New York so I'm gonna book this Wow I'm excited we're so spontaneous we are so spontaneous me and you hid we are so we're crazy do I really want to do this we're going to New York yay I'm here we're back we're back in New York this is so weird cuz I was just here it's really nice being here in like a relaxing way cuz last time I was here I was here for Fashion Week and I had a few days off but it wasn't the most relaxing experience and now I'm here just for me and I'm so excited because I feel like I can actually like relax do my phone just died I wanted to post me something but now I need to charge my phone literally just let me tell you how exhausted I was I have not slept in like three days so I know two nights ago or last night well I did sleep last night actually I didn't sleep three nights ago or last night knowing I didn't [ __ ] it when I the second I got on the plane I just was out the seat that I was in on the plane like I had a bunch of different sit like you could work I'm not gonna go into that that's too complicated of a story and I don't have the energy so we're here we're back this is great I'm so excited and I need to order matcha and coffee so ordered oh my god literally look at this map this is so far away we're literally I could literally go downstairs and [ __ ] get a coffee I just realize how [ __ ] up that is did you just see my face I literally was like oh my god Emma that's bad I'd give you a room tour but there's really nothing to see like there's a bathroom and there's beds so I'm literally covering my legs cuz I haven't shaved them and so long like they are unbelievably area oh my god he didn't give me a straw what the [ __ ] I feel like I'm so irritated right now because I literally am so sleep-deprived I can't stop watching tic TOCs okay and like now I want to make one if you all make a tick-tock video let's try the coffee it's [ __ ] unmatched here's the matcha if you drink matcha after having a sip of that coffee it just doesn't taste as good do it like you like straws like drinking straws okay sorry okay you know okay I guess I'll just drink it with a straw bed like that was rude oh you found the wrong number get over it like yeah I did and I'm [ __ ] stupid learn about it okay I need to take it out like I literally need to sleep hi if you guys thought that I was gonna do anything cool today you would be so wrong and I'm actually kinda sad about it cuz I was like oh I'm gonna get to New York like super nice and early the first day I get there so I'm gonna have a lot of time to do stuff and then I just laid in bed but I'm just really sleep-deprived and I needed this and that's like the whole point of vacation is like catching up on sleep right so I ordered some vegan Froyo it's really good tomato just fruits oh I'm such a creature of habit because literally the last time I was in New York I ate and the popsicle I did the same thing last time I'm such a creature of habit I made a video where I went on a trip by myself to Laguna during the summer and I had an awful time because I was just by myself I don't know what my issue was because now I'm in New York by myself which is even farther away from home and like I'm having a great time I'm an adult now a [ __ ] I really try to have a relaxing self-reflecting trip I can't go shopping because I literally brought such a small suitcase I don't have room for Chet New York is just a great place to eat like there's just so much good [ __ ] food here I'm literally gonna spend the next six hours watching tape talks and then go to bed I will see you guys tomorrow [Music] okay just worked out I look like [ __ ] wait I don't even want to fill myself right now I look so ugly also like vlogging in New York is weird because I am I'm being judged so hard okay I can't talk to the camera anymore but I'm gonna get food and I'm gonna get coffee and maybe matcha right now because I need to and also because I feel y'all will distract me from the fact that I'm being judged so hard right now but I just worked out and it was terrible so actually no it wasn't terrible I don't know I can't decide I don't know where the [ __ ] to go cuz I don't know anything about New York so I need to Yelp a place to eat okay I wanted to get coffee and food and stuff but I just found this matcha place that looks so sick and I've been drinking matcha recently let's see how far away it is oh my god no it's a 10-minute Drive never [ __ ] mind when you're visiting somewhere and year by yourself how are you supposed to know it's good and I normally would just pose me something so I wouldn't have to like make that I wouldn't have to do the research but doing the research okay sorry I'm being a whiny baby I just need my coffee okay or matcha caught here matcha I've now broadened my horizons ah sorry I just think it's fun to do that at times I'm back in my hotel room I only ended up getting coffee because I just couldn't figure out a place to eat okay and I just everything was a mess so I'm now going to order room service I've stayed at this hotel before and I never tried the room service so might as well try I'm not like that hungry hmm I am I'm hungry I don't know what I want I never know how much to order when I'm ordering food like because I don't want to overdo it and then get like really full and like then like feel uncomfortable but then I also don't want to like not order enough food because then I would have to wait so long though can I have two hard-boiled egg and then can I do the avocado iced americano let's do like four shots with salt and pepper and hot sauce on the side thank you so much man yo okay they have whatever thank you ma'am I don't know what that second call was about I need to shower okay this coffee doesn't have ice in it so that's kind of a problem they gave me my room service in a back I don't know oh this looks great fun I think you never know how something like this is gonna be until you eat it so avocado toast review it's like a six out of ten like it's good I don't know what to do today I'm gonna like get ready and try to make myself look cute it's not really possible but I'm gonna do my best maybe I'll Google like what to do in New York also these hard-boiled eggs are literally so out hot out but I don't know why am I here ah so I don't know what it is about New York but I feel like when I'm here I just like want to get ready begin my mouth is burning I just ate a hard-boiled egg with hot sauce in it hurts we're gonna get ready for the day I feel like in LA I just feel like lazy like I don't wanna I don't care what I look like there's no reason for me to get ready for the day but in New York you just feel so productive when you're walking around really yeah in LA I'm like okay I'm just a loser welcome to my get ready with me just kidding I'm not doing and get ready with me I just wanted to talk to you guys I'm not doing you get ready with me because guess what I wouldn't do that to you know there's anything wrong with you get ready with me but like get ready with these are only good to watch when the person like looks really put together at the end like they know what they're doing and then there's like but me like I I don't even know what I'm doing like I'm the one that watches get ready with me it's not the one that makes them okay because I'm the one that needs to learn how the [ __ ] to get ready for the day cuz apparently I don't know what I'm doing in that department okay also one last anecdote is not even the right word let me literally look at what that means cuz I have no [ __ ] idea what that means a short amusing or interesting story about a real incident or person that is actually exactly the word I needed and I didn't even know what it meant and I used it correctly so that's [ __ ] all y'all to say on thus far the anecdote I was gonna go into was that just when I thought that New York wasn't perfect it is because literally my skin is so good when I'm in New York like all of my acne like heals and then I go to LA and then they only [ __ ] can you believe that's my eyebrow routine what you just saw I literally just put gel on and then when I'm like in my mid-20s that's what I'm gonna move to New York and I'm going to okay I'm literally doing this with no technique at all like what am i doing I'm gonna move to New York like when I have like a fiance you know anything like what I'm like planning on getting married soon the lake will I you know ever in between me getting married and having it Chuck whatever do you want you don't care okay I'm leaving so I got ready for the day did my hair did my makeup was feeling so excited for the day and then I like just laid in bed okay for like three hours and so now my makeups like looks like [ __ ] and my hair like looks like [ __ ] and I need to do something with my day because I literally have today and then like a little bit of tomorrow and then I leave I have a few ideas I'm gonna Google things to do in New York and see if I get any ideas I hate on hotels you have to buy Wi-Fi like it should be free go to the Statue of Liberty now Legoland no I'm not doing that oh the Metropolitan the men I heard that's fun oh and their clothes [ __ ] I didn't think about this just go explore yeah wait why not better than what I'm doing now which is being in bed let's go oh no I can't sing because okay yeah beautiful it is though I'm literally not kidding somebody better like stop me from moving here cuz I want to move here I want to move sorry Graham let's go okay like which way do I go okay I'm just gonna like start walking oh my god I feel like [ __ ] Casey nice that I'm literally Casey nice tat [ __ ] the haters I'm vlogging in the street this is embarrassing no I am being stared at but if you really think about it I'm winning because I don't care okay now it's awkward I'm just walking around New York I had to move here like this week I'm moving just kidding I'm not I can't well should I I've got a park I think this could be an interesting thing um but I feel like it's weird that I'm here I can feel like I'm too old to be at a park but I also kind of want to go in the monkey bars but also people are watching me so should I do this now do you know what I'm not because I'm scaring moms because moms think I'm creepy because I have a camera and then I'm filming their children so like I literally just got death stared by a mother like just let me go down the slide I'm a child too I'm literally a child no I'm not I'm 18 but like I am a child I was a child like a week ago I deserve to be able to go on the playground without being judged whatever just walking trying to find coffee [Music] that is actually incredible yep that's good hmm that's good it's so good I've really done anything you forget coffee and like almost go on some monkey bars in a swing set but nothing's really interesting has happened yet so but it's been fun to just walk around and see the sights so it's starting to get dark I might go back soon but for now I'm just like enjoying window shopping and just walking around I can't go shopping because I can't I don't have room my suitcase bring anything home so I'm just window shopping which is fun I Love New York I'm gonna move here I keep saying that I'm not gonna take it back though [Music] I'm a youtuber never mind basically a lot has happened since I last saw you I know I heard back to my room I got Italian food it was [ __ ] unbelievable I got some pesto gnocchi and then after I had dinner I went to one of those New York souvenir shops that they have on literally every corner and I went on a shopping spree and I'm gonna do a haul so as you know last time I was in you boy you might not know but I bought this last time I was in New York and it was overpriced first I got this crewneck and it's so nice so anyway next I bought oh my god I'm so excited I bought Declan my cat if you don't know but come on I bought Declan a [ __ ] New York hoodie next I bought these booty shorts come on this is so fun okay next I bought this I think it's cute I think it'd be cute cropped whatever then I bought this shirt which I also think would be cool cropped just says New York on it okay I also think about keychains so let me see oh wait this is so [ __ ] boring wait this is literally so boring okay and then the last thing I bought I have to do a triumphant haul for because they're just that sick [Music] okay so that's what he bought anyway after I did my shopping spree I went to 7-Eleven I walked ten minutes to 7-eleven to get makeup wipes because I left my makeup wipes at home apparently and it's literally midnight so walking to 7-eleven at this hour is like not ideal and it was so terrifying and then I get to 7-eleven and realized that they don't even sell makeup wipes so then I start walking to Rite Aid which was another ten minutes away at this point I'm so scared then I call an uber I go to Rite Aid I buy makeup wipes then I come home and now here we are that's that I'm going to bed [Music] [Music]

-emma chamberlain",2019-09-26T18:59:54Z,245126,5450462,8708,[Applause] literally geez I'm popular all of a sudden hold on this is literally the dumbest video this is this video just has no point I'm literally about to torture myself for 24 hours for no reason and like I don't know why I'm doing this but like I really want to because I feel like it'd be fun today I'm going to be living in my closet like inside my closet like I'm just gonna try to live in my closet for 24 hours just cuz I did the video where I you know lived on my balcony for 24 hours now it's kind of nice why is this making me want to go camping that was weirdly a fun challenge and I feel like living in my closet for 24 hours would be really fascinating to see how I can entertain myself within like a nine foot by 10 foot know that's generous like a nine by five foot room basically this is gonna test my claustrophobia and see if I can handle it okay let's do it but first we have to set up my closet because my closet is not ready for this event this is so crooked okay that's good enough [ __ ] it here's wait it's so crooked I literally give up I don't care [Music] okay so that's my bed now let's get some pillows okay let's move in okay Jacqueline this is gonna be tough excuse me sir you or not do you want to be in here for 24 hours with me I don't think you do sir you're not gonna like it is there's no letterbox the doors in my closet are shut I am now what the [ __ ] am i doing this is so weird so let me tell you the rules of the game I have my computer I have oh my god Declan is trying to get in I'm doing a closet for 24 hours which means that I get to leave my closet tomorrow morning because it's like morning right now I already had breakfast I had coffee all that basically I just have to spend the whole day in here I have one pass though I get to leave my closet one time and that is to get dinner like from my fridge or from post mates probably post mates I feel like I could entertain myself by going on my phone for the next two hours I'm just on my phone okay I can bored I'm bored of being on my phone like what is there to do like I didn't really think about that I could color-coordinating my closet I love that okay let's do it I feel like this is gonna be easier than living on my balcony because at least I'm inside the color-coordinating starts now this is actually really valuable I feel like maybe this is actually gonna make my life like a lot more enjoyable so I'm not really mad about it but I don't know how to color-coordinate okay hold on let's take everything red out wait five two of the same shirt I'm starting to feel like upset a little bit I've literally been in here for like maybe a half hour and I'm like upset I have so many white shirts like what is it with me in white shirts oh this is starting to look good I'm already getting excited about like what I'm eat for dinner like what's it gonna be also what else should I do in here I was thinking I could like get some [ __ ] done do you know any mean like accomplish something while I'm in here because if I don't accomplish anything while I'm in here like I'm just gonna get sad and like feeling I wasted my whole day so I'm thinking like I get some errands done like get [ __ ] done that I've been like putting off you know for example I have a parking ticket - I have two parking tickets that I haven't paid and I've been like putting off paying them well the time is now okay I'm gonna pay them [ __ ] wait I don't want to organize my closet anymore like this is not fun why am i so whiny that's like a question like why do I just whine about everything being in my closet for the whole day could actually kind of serve as like a self-reflection period like this is a really great chance for me to just kind of think about why I'm such a [ __ ] idiot and like why I'm such a mess I'm like how I can fix it Declan literally misses me I hear him meowing out there first problem it's hot in here okay I didn't fully color-coordinate my closet but I think I think I did good enough like that's like kind of color-coordinated like I put all the whites okay it looks like [ __ ] okay let's talk about my feelings so recently I've been drinking matcha you guys know me as being a very big coffee drinker recently I've been drinking matcha I had two today already along with coffee I woke up got matcha then got matcha again then worked out then I got matcha again wait this is not a joke I've gone matcha three times today from three different places then realize that I wanted coffee went and got coffee do you know how much caffeine coffee like how much how am I suppose a [ __ ] be in this room all day after drinking that much caffeine I don't know this is gonna be a long a long journey hell I get to spend a lot of time just like watching YouTube to pass the time I'm gonna like I'm just gonna try to like meditate and relax in here it's pretty comfortable like I'm not uncomfortable I'm just gonna try to chill in here and and see how it goes alright this is so boring in my closet I kind of feel comfortable and safe in here though I feel like I'm in like a womb I'm feel like I'm in like a like I feel like I'm very cozy in here I feel very safe I feel safe like I feel like nobody could find me in here I feel like nobody could touch me in here I felt very safe which is good okay cuz I'll see you guys mm-hmm I've been in here for a while virtually doing nothing it's been a little while like I managed to pass a lot of time I was like watching tick tock so I was watching youtube videos recently I've been loving watching take chunks okay and not proud of it but I also am because I found some really great take stalkers actually I did not bring enough water in here I brought one cup of water in here there's no way I need to be texting people while I'm in here in starting up conversation because I'm so bored like I'm texting my mom right now about like nothing I got two parking tickets so basically the first one I got was because I parked on my street and it was sweet cleaning which meant that you weren't allowed to park there because they were cleaning the street so I got a $65 ticket and then later that day out later that day I got a ticket because I parked on my street in the red zone on accident how do you do that I don't know now I need to pay those and I'm running out of time I only have like a week left anyway while I'm paying this 2-part ticket let's talk about what I'm gonna eat for dinner I'm thinking like vegan pizza maybe a salad sushi oh I don't know I mean I don't know definitely gonna post meat though because I've been [ __ ] I'm like dying in here what I almost saw that like I was late to paying this ticket and then I was gonna have to pay double but I just read it wrong cuz I'm so stupid I actually don't think that I'm really that dumb like I don't think I'm really that dumb of a person overall like I feel like there's you know it could be worse right but actually I am also super dumb like why why do I do these mindless things like it's really really easy not to park in the red zone they probably one of the easiest things you can do so like what went wrong I've been trying to pay this parking ticket for like 20 minutes but I keep getting distracted oh my god I'm done paying my parking ticket yeah I've been like putting it off for Adler announced tons let's talk so basically I want to eat more nuts I'm hungry like I didn't really plan this out very well because I didn't bring much food I brought like no water which is fine cuz I barely drink water anyway I'm not saying that that's good I'm just saying that that's the truth I hate eating in front of people because I know I eat gross my mouth doesn't look cute when I eat like [ __ ] you if you eat like this hold on oh I only get time to go on my phone again guys listen I'm [ __ ] losing it it's nighttime now I've just been like sitting here like [ __ ] watching movies on my phone like for some reason being in this closet has just sucked all the energy out of me okay I definitely need to eat I'm kind of in the mood for like Thai food wait - my phone just died oh [ __ ] I didn't really think about that one did I my phone's dead I want to pass time basically and I feel like I should nap and then I'll eat later okay is that should I do that why am I like what am i doing listen here's the situation I just woke up from a little nap my phone is dead my laptop is dead I don't have any chargers and I'm starving I think it's about time that I used my one pass being able to leave this closet so that I can nourish my body and also go to the bathroom because I have not done that this is a big moment oh my god yes but I still have to sleep in here so like I don't know oh my god hi okay so I've decided because it's so late it's 2:00 a.m. it's actually almost 3:00 because it's so late I like can't speak like I'm literally a mess like being in that closet just [ __ ] me up we need to make some dinner because I'm hungry and I was going to pose me but it's just gonna take too much time and I really just want to go back to bed so what are we gonna do I could do ot eel I could do a backup I'm gonna do all kind of tests that's what I felt really like safe in the closet and like warm and comfortable but the problem is is like I'm just so bored I ate at a restaurant recently and they gave me avocados toasted and hummus on it me being a really big fan of avocado toast and of hummus this was amazing for me and it was actually so delicious so now I make my avocado toast with hummus that's my point something that I do when I'm waiting for my food to be done cooking is I like to eat almond butter out of the jar and I'm not proud of it but it's so good oh I need that more than I thought mmm I just feel really like really drained and like I don't have much to say all I know though is that this avocado toast is crazy let's bring this down and eat it in the closet this was a really good way for me to force myself to take a day off you know what I mean cuz I just didn't do anything Vedas laid in here I went by quicker than I expected because I was doing stuff on my computer I'm gonna have to go back outside you turn off my light this wasn't that hard like it just went by really quick okay wait really quick is generous it didn't go by really quick it didn't feel as long and drawn-out as I was expecting I need to go turn out my light oh and I need to grab my phone okay be right back okay I can't decide if today has been miserable or not I don't even know okay I'm gonna go to bed I'm gonna try to go to bed it's right now it's about 3:00 a.m. I feel like today was one of the most pointless days of my life Oh guys we're gonna go to sleep I'll let you know if I wait go in the night I hope I don't good night good morning we I'm allowed to open this now oh did you Ruth oh I'm just so happy it's over um you know last night was actually not that bad oh I'm never doing this again okay well you like this pointless ass [ __ ] video let me know I know and if you hated it know I love you guys oh good day keep it real all right follow your dreams bye [Music]

-emma chamberlain",2019-09-22T20:00:12Z,295831,7470904,10056,ow [Music] hi i'm in new york take a look that is definitely not la at all i am in new york for like six days i've been here for like two or three i love new york every time i have a mental breakdown literally one of my family members or friends have to convince me not to move to new york because for some reason i feel like i would like living here although i know better like i know i would hate it but like i kind of want to move here still i don't know i just feel like it's so like artsy and there's like so many good cafes everything's so cute and like so like pretty but yeah i'd probably hate it so anyway i've been to new york a few times but i've never really had free time while i've been here i've always liked been here for a reason and had something i had to do so i'd never been able to like fully experience new york for what it is today's my day off while i'm in new york and i was like okay what am i going to do i want to make the most of the day and do something crazy do something crazy i was thinking about all the things that i wanted to do here and they are as such coffee food and shopping well i already have been getting food and getting coffee so i was like what's left okay shopping but like i shop all the time i'm sorry but the last thing i need to do is go shopping in new york but you know what i could do is go thrifting in new york round of applause i used to make thrifting videos all the time i used to go thrifting all the time and then i just like forgot about it and forgot about how fun it was and i just like gave up on it but recently i've been wanting to thrift and all the stores in la are kind of like not good so today we're going thrifting in new york see what we can find see what we can discover i literally went on yelp last night and looked up vintage thrift whatever i found like 10 thrift stores walking distance from my hotel so i was like all right this sounds like a plan so today we're gonna go thrifting and see what we can find i only really go to like three different like vintage thrift stores in la and maybe i just need to branch out and stop being a little [ __ ] maybe that's what i need to do so let's go oh i was not expecting to make that sound okay wait we need to do a few things before i show you what i got can i have a iced americana i went to three stores three stores is good but like i want to get the full new york thrifting experience and i feel like i didn't let me do a recap and i'll show you what i've gotten so far and then we'll do more shopping but i feel like why not show you what i got because i'm excited about it actually let me take my glasses off you know what let's talk about these you see these you think they're cute well i hope you do because i designed them and i also designed five other pairs with the brand crap eyewear aka my favorite eyeglass brand that exists me and crap work together designed some glasses i'm super excited about them and they will be available on the 27th september 27th if you want to cop them link will be in the description now let me show you what i got okay so the first door i went to was like the most traditional thrift store i've experienced thus far in new york it was like very rough around the edges there was some [ __ ] weird [ __ ] in there so the first few things i got are [ __ ] random like what is this i don't know and i don't know why i bought it either it's a little pin like a little wood pin super like retro-e like i don't know what it is i don't know where i would put it and i don't know why i bought it but i just it was kind of one of those like impulse buys like it was and i also got more things out of impulse one of them being this pointless necklace um it was five dollars i feel like it would look good with the necklaces i have on right now so i want to try that's a little bit much i also got this necklace you know okay wait i used to wear a necklace exactly like this that was a choker oh that's kind of cool okay i'll leave it's too big next i got this leather jacket okay this i was really excited about because i don't really have a leather jacket and the inside is like soft which is like of course survive um and it was only 35 bucks which is actually kind of expensive i don't know something about it i wanted it so i got it that's kind of how shopping works this i don't know why about this and i don't know if i even like it because i haven't tried it on i feel like this could be kind of fun because it looks like it's from like the 90s or like early 2000s just because of the shape of it something about it was appealing to me and i bought it next i got this oh my god there's a pattern on the back what the [ __ ] is on the back i want to crop this hopefully so i think this would look cool cropped yeah this was 25 i feel like again overpriced but whatever i got this ugly ass [ __ ] t-shirt this shirt is literally so ugly it's unbelievable it is so ugly and then last but not least from the first store i got this extremely heavy jacket it's like this brown denim jacket and underneath it has like a hoodie built in which i love that so this is really nice also i didn't i haven't shaved my arm don't look at it i haven't shaved my armpits in like a week because i forgot my razor on this trip what are you gonna do about it second store that i went in i actually didn't buy anything i found this skirt that i like loved but then the zipper was broken and then i also found these pants that i loved but they had a rip in it so like everything in that store was [ __ ] up like everything looked cute but then when you tried on it would be [ __ ] up you see i'm saying so like that didn't go well but everything's really overpriced in big cities no [ __ ] okay i don't know why i said that everybody knows that last but not least i went into round two vintage which is literally the epitome of overpriced first i got this new york shirt as a cute symbol of my trip i spent way too much on this shirt i don't even want to talk about it i get this for like 10 bucks in the airport but i instead spent like 40 bucks on it because i just really like the design and i'm embarrassed so whatever i also got this big nike shirt just because i feel like it looks comfortable also like literally look at my armpit like i'm i know and then last but not least this is the most exciting thing i've gotten thus far hopefully i have more luck later in the day these shorts you're probably like emma those are so ugly yes they are but that's why i like them i think they're so fun i'm so excited to wear these somehow i'm gonna relax for a little bit and then we're gonna go back out okay my coffee just came let's try it actually not bad for like a cup of black coffee you know how like earlier i was like oh um we're gonna do more thrift shopping because like i didn't get the full experience okay i'm tired like i laid around for an hour drank my coffee more like drink like none of it because it was not that good not impressed by that i've just been laying in bed on my phone and i am tired and hungry so instead of doing more thrift shopping i postmated i ordered mediterranean food which is wow if you don't like falafel or if you've never tried falafel get on that [ __ ] also hummus my favorite food really excited about that did i order a salad too probably not going to eat that i always order salads just because like i want to feel good about what i'm eating and i want to feel like i'm eating something healthy but then i don't end up eating the salad and i just end up eating everything else let's order a coffee shall we okay let's see if there's any coffee shops that look good okay i'm literally getting a random [ __ ] drink it's hard because you just you never know like you never know if it's gonna be good you know what i want to try oh this is fun this is fun guys i feel like i always order the same things so why don't we try a new coffee drink okay maybe i'll order a few drinks and i can do like a taste test i'm just bored that's all this is i'm gonna get a nice latte with cashew milk oh my god why is it 11 you know what while i'm at it i'm just gonna order a regular iced almond milk latte just in case i end up hating the cashew milk okay so now this video has turned instead of thrift shopping now we're going to be eating which is honestly more fun my friends are in new york too but why did the fan just turn on oh my god i just turned off what the [ __ ] going on actually i just got anxious and thought about like what if the postmate was outside hello both of my orders are arriving at the same time my coffee and my food which i ordered from separate places so that's actually super exciting and exhilarating for me oh yeah here we are i have another postmate coming up so this is kind of awkward because i don't want to like start eating and then him get here you know it's going to be like chaotic oh wow these falafels have something green on it okay this hummus looks insanely good pita bread and then here's a greek salad that i'm probably not gonna eat because i'm probably gonna well no i'm gonna eat it i'll eat it the texture is not my favorite okay so like overall i'm not that impressed with this food but it's good and i'm gonna eat it it's just not my favorite but whatever now let's try my lattes okay this is the almond milk and this is the cashew milk oh they gave me a [ __ ] plastic straw dang it i don't even want to use it i'm gonna use my old paper one now i'm mad i should have known cashew milk coffee cashew milk might be my new thing if i end up liking cashew milk better than almond milk i know i like oat milk but oh my god it's totally better now let's try this pita bread oh my god it's kind of not soft this hummus sucks and so does the falafel what happened this on the other hand that shit's good my god cashew milk [ __ ] that was the least successful mukbang of all okay i always use the word mukbang and i don't talk i don't like doing mukbangs i hate them i just can't make it work should i try the salad is there dressing on it there's no dressing on it what i learned is that i'm not ordering from this place again i'm still gonna eat this food don't wanna waste it obviously but i would give it a good three out of ten i'm not impressed and i'm pissed this though is a ten out of ten all right i'll let you know if something else cool happens okay one more thing before i finish eating like the best part about this failure of a meal is that i spent 40 minutes on yelp trying to find a good place to eat 40 minutes on yelp i was reading every yelp review i was looking at everything and somehow nobody mentioned that this restaurant was not good i don't know what this video is but you know what that was a scary face we're gonna have fun with it this is now a vlog before it was a thrifting video now it's a vlog who says you can't 360 your video halfway through it who says you can't no one after i'm needing him to nap and then maybe we'll do some fun nighttime activities which i honestly doubt because i literally don't do anything at night like i don't go out past 9 30. okay i'll see you when whenever i do whatever i do okay so listen i just woke up from a nap as you can tell by like those types of situations the thing is i wanted to like do something fun this evening um maybe go shopping a little more maybe go down to dinner like because my other dinner failed as we know the makeup's coming off it's like 10 15 almost i've been taking like insane naps while i've been here even though i've been sleeping like pretty good at night i didn't do too much but i feel like i did but i didn't i ordered um this frozen yogurt that's made out of just fruit and water and a sweetener of some sort and they make frozen yogurt and popsicles out of just fruit and then you can get toppings and stuff like that it's kind of like press juice but a little bit different that's my that's my fun activity okay so i don't care i hate to break it to you guys but i'm really not that interesting i just don't do that much waiting to get that knock on the door i start to like sense when they're gonna knock on the door like it's weird like it's this thing where i start to know like i get a gut feeling like i can sense them coming but then i turn on the camera and then they don't come so i don't know if that's like blocking the energy like the camera being on but i'm like determined to like wait this out with you guys on okay i guys i know it seems like a false alarm i know you guys are starting to lose hope thinking that it's not even coming it is i told you i got two things i got a raspberry popsicle with chocolate and coconut shavings on it and then i got strawberry soft serve with peanut butter and almonds and coconut and all that oh my god my life is so fun me just [ __ ] not doing anything i just napped for four hours and i think i'm gonna go to bed soon the thing that's so fun about sleeping is that you don't really know you're doing it it's just kind of happening so like it's weirdly one of the most fun activities before i say good night to you guys i'm going to talk about an issue that i had last night when i ordered this popsicle because i got these things last night this popsicle has a chocolate coating around it last night i was trying to figure out a way to eat it and the only way i could figure out was to bite it and you know what biting ice cream is something that people look down upon i don't have a choice with this popsicle like i have to bite it i'm a mess i need to go to bed i love you guys i hope you had fun with me today we didn't really do much but we did but we didn't you know that's the story of my life so i hope you guys had fun um watching me eat and shop that's literally all i do i'm going to bed early you should too not to be your mom or anything but go to bed early because it's good for you and you feel good i love you guys thanks for watching don't forget to be yourself have fun and follow your dreams babe babe why do i just call you babe i don't call anyone babe that just isn't a thing in my world but apparently you've changed me i like to end my videos in a funny way but there's like no way to end it funny today so bye [ __ ] [Music] you

-emma chamberlain",2019-09-15T20:29:13Z,240718,4773179,7891,[Music] [Applause] hi [Music] um nope [ __ ] copyrighted if I sing that how are you guys hope you're doing good hope you can't hear my AC it's really loud I don't know why it's so loud I have this consistent issue in my life where I have days then I'm like in the mood to get ready you know and I'm in the mood to like look better than normal and so then I get ready for no reason what I'm done getting ready I realize that I just got ready for no reason and then it bothers me because I'm like okay well what was the point of me getting ready today like somebody needs to know that I got ready today and then I force my friends to take instagram photos of me so that the world knows that I got ready that day here's the problem I'm having one of those days I got ready this morning for no [ __ ] reason like why am i wearing makeup right now I just my friends and was like hey like let's take Instagram photos today cuz like that could be fun right cuz we're all bored well they didn't respond to me and it's been an hour and I'm impatient and I want an Instagram photo that sounds [ __ ] up I like taking Instagram photos because I like wearing fun outfits and getting creative and like whatever that's the main reason why I love in shrim is because it's where I get to like express myself with my fashion or just like post random [ __ ] I mean it's not always fashion it forces me to get too creative with my outfit it forces me to like get ready and like look better than normal like it's fun I think it's like fun I don't really put a lot of pressure on it I just like that fun with it but here's what we're doing today cuz you don't know what we're doing still cuz I'm not gonna YouTube okay today I thought it'd be fun if I try to take Instagram photos of myself but make the photo seem like someone else took it for me does that make sense because I'm not all about that timer cam Leigh my goal today is to take photos of myself that people would not think we're taken on timer cam because I want to pose on Instagram I got [ __ ] ready today for nothing like I want to make it worth it for me I recently bought some new clothes I want to [ __ ] put them to use like let's get Instagram photo out of this I don't want to go in public like I don't want anybody to see me taking photos of myself because there's just like no way I can deal with that type of discomfort basically the challenge of today is I'm gonna try to successfully take Instagram photos of myself that make it look like my friends took them for me this is a challenge video so take your paper sometimes or is this like just me like being stupid I don't know I think this could be fun though I think I have a tripod a phone tripod that we could use for this so that the phone is like a less propped up angle like it'll have a more organic angle I think I have a tripod let me look I might not I do have the tripod I have to go oh [ __ ] I just broke it Jesus Christ let's see if I can't detach this [ __ ] that is one weight I might be on to something guys my Instagram contents about to go crazy oh stop holy [ __ ] ok let's get into it let's change into a fun outfit and then try to get creative I'm outside on my I have two decks in my apartment I shave three oh my god okay I have a lot of options today I'm wearing it outfit I'm really unamused by it I kind of hate it but I was in my closet for like 40 minutes and it hated everything so that was kind of like we didn't have a lot of options this [ __ ] tripod those genius I absolutely give myself credit for this what if I sit on this that's cute okay I'm a new truck oh god I'm embarrassed wait not gonna be cute okay Loki this is actually my new thing I'm embarrassed what am i [ __ ] doing oh I'm cringing I'm cringing cuz I know that like posing for Instagram photos oh yeah let me do a smiling one I feel like I never smiled my Instagram oh [ __ ] dang it oh wow that was a very natural candy let's see how these photos are looking oh my god they're so dark you literally can't see me what the [ __ ] have I just been doing for the past 10 minutes then what if I take like a video and then screenshot from the video is that like too obvious yeah being fake happy for Instagram that's what it is right the quality is terrible [ __ ] I definitely [ __ ] that up Instagram okay wait these are better wait kind of good like that's cute okay wait we might have an Instagram post on our hands I just might have to spend another three hours doing this but like that's fine oh [ __ ] I'm taking a video right now and then I'm gonna screenshot from it if that works although that's kind of unpredictable so we'll see that was fun but let me add it up the photos let's see what we ended up getting this is the most conceited YouTube video ever ever posted la changed me I'm sorry okay we're back I just edited all the photos so basically my general consensus is that number one the quality is bad so that's kind of annoying like if you like the photos don't look as crispy as a normal also the framing is awkward like why am I like sometimes on the bottom of the screen sometimes I'm like just way too like sadness smack Dada smack dab in the middle like I mean I guess I would post one but I feel like I just know too much like I know that I took these myself and I'm embarrassed of that so I would never post these but my goal today is to get a postable Instagram photo this first try didn't work out and I just [ __ ] up they just aren't good well I'm not giving up I'm gonna try two more outfits in two more locations so I'll give myself a chance it would be a lot easier if one of my friends would just [ __ ] hang out with me and take photos so I'm next outfit I'm wearing a turtleneck it actually looks cool but it is also 90 degrees outside so like why am i doing that anyways let me see where the lighting is good nope this lighting shitty okay that Lighting's asked but I'm gonna try to make it work oh you know I'm so cringy I'm sorry I don't want to hear it trying to be happy for Instagram okay let's see if I've gotten anything good okay these actually look a lot more realistic wait these really good oh my god wait this might be went oh my god this worked so good I don't know if you can see this photo but it looks cool as [ __ ] you'll see it later okay I'm gonna take a few more and then we're gonna edit these up I swear to God I might post these do you see me [ __ ] flip around like that that was embarrassing I'm done with that let's go edit them up see how they turn out see if they're opposable I think this might be impossible those are sick dude guys oh it's dark okay just edited these in like these are sick oh my god declan's playing with my microphone okay these are really nice I really like these like I killed this [ __ ] for once I feel like I [ __ ] everything up but this is actually cool like this one okay these are definitely contenders but we have one more outfit Wow that's a good that's like a really like vogue ass photo like vogue taking photos by yourself article I'll shut up now okay one last right although I feel like it's gonna be hard for me to outdo that that photos dramatic I'm kind of like nervous to post that I feel like that's like a it's a bold statement I'm gonna go spend another 45 minutes in my closet trying to pick out another outfit so great because it takes me 40 minutes speaking of it like imagine it taking you 40 minutes to pick out jeans a turtleneck and a sweater but for some reason I am so not quickening outfits takes me an hour so see you guys like six hours I'm in my last outfit we got some white shorts or whatever you guys don't care so I'm gonna go back up on the deck up there because I feel like I could probably make it look like a different location but in the same spot also because the lighting up there apparently sleighs a little bit so I have this like cute little like Ally little way right here if I can get the lighting right this could be a vibe so let's see what happens okay update lighting here is shitty um I'm literally wearing white shorts and I'm on my period this is like playing with fire but okay I feel like I just can't get this right this couldn't work I think I found the spot sorry this angles so shitty I just like whatever yes I stand on my tippy toes cuz I'm five five okay I'm just I don't have a lot to work with I'm not super stoked on this lighting which means that we need to try more options me setting up my [ __ ] camera for 20 minutes be like fake holding the glasses a classic Instagram move ah that's my cue to stop this is like the Instagram Olympics okay these have potential there could be something there but I need to edit them in order to find out so let me edit I'll be back my sorry declan's playing with his toys at a very bad time okay I'm done editing this last round of photos you know what they didn't turn out terrible actually like the lighting was actually pretty good the angles were pretty convincing as well the only issue was I didn't look that good in them cuz I wasn't I just you know sometimes you just don't pose right you know what I mean I just wasn't getting my angles but I actually like a lot of these I feel like these are better like for like an outfit photo like I'll just crop my head out I like to do that sometimes when I don't think my face looks good but I like my outfit I'll just crawl my head out anyways I don't hate these so but okay I'm not gonna post those last ones though because they just didn't feel right um but there actually was a winner and I did succeed during this challenge I the second outfit wins and I'm posting the photos right now okay I'm gonna post these and then we're gonna see if anybody comments and is like Emma who the [ __ ] took these what if I just captured the potato emojis that's like too obvious romaine lettuce baby okay let's read some comments see if anything sticks out okay no one's saying anything yet about me taking this photo using timer cam so I think I'm I think I'm fooling the masses literally no one's saying anything about it oh my god that was good guys timer cam who I don't know her sometimes like it's scary [ __ ] commenting on my photos somebody commented if you want to see a video of a man being then request my man somebody commented are you sweating correct and literally responding to this somebody commented do you wear the same jeans in every photo I'm insulted that's the end of this video I feel me I did the damn thing well that's it that's today's video I hope you guys had fun I did I now know that next time I need an Instagram photo or not need that's a strong word next time I want to take an Instagram photo I like my outfit but I don't have anybody available to take that photo for me I have this bad boy and this thing thing works oh wait somebody commented who took them so somebody actually thought that somebody took them for me y'all I am gonna break I'm gonna wrap this up um number one I love you guys number two you guys are the best number three hope you enjoyed this video timer cam is your friend okay and you know what and Instagram photos don't [ __ ] matter anyway so even if ya just Instagram photos no matter anyway so I will see you guys next week I love you guys follow your dreams that's a good one cam 2 shout out now bye [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-09-01T19:02:27Z,365385,8638376,28040,[Music] [Applause] hi [Music] hey um if you didn't know it's hot girl summer I mean it's been hot girl summer for a few months now but I feel like I haven't really been embodying that as well as I should be I've just been kinda like not really trying very hard which don't you wrong you can be embodying hot girls summer just by existing and breathing but I want to take it to the next level I need a makeover cuz I'm gonna not I just I need it so it's 9 a.m. and we're doing a hot girl summer makeover today I'm probably gonna spend all day doing this and we'll see what happens I'm gonna try to make myself look as good as possible because why not it's hot girl summer I can do what I want if I want to make myself look cute maybe I'll take an Instagram pic I can do that you know we're starting this video out with a bang cuz I'm about to go get my hair dyed I never really know what I want to get done and then I'll send like a few photos for inspo and just say do this and I've made that mistake I've made a few mistakes before we're like I've shown the photo and then they've like you know done exactly what the photo showed but then I didn't end up liking it so I'll show you guys what I'm going for basically like my natural color except with like a little bit of blonde a day and you literally can't see it so that's what I'm going for today I like that look where it's like brown on the table kind of goes to blonde because then when my hair grows out I don't need to get it read I'd if I don't want to and it still looks normal I haven't gotten my hair dyed since April it's now hot girl August my hair is blue knows things where I just like don't really care about it that much and I just kind of put it into a bond of some sort and then just call it a day usually but it's nice to have here that you think looks pretty ok let's go get our hair dye we're gonna be doing hair makeup outfit the whole nine yards [ __ ] why is this shadow in my face the whole nine yards we're gonna do all the fun stuff hair makeup outfit it's gonna be amazing I'm gonna look the hottest girl summer I've ever looked yeah what was that I can't take it back it's do it I look like the girl with the perlier in that book if you know what I'm talking about what the [ __ ] Oh Murch launch I am so excited what are we doing we're going brown a little bit early just picture night no you're good we're going brown a little bit yes which is kind of like a reroute a plan but I'm excited are you excited I'm so sensible yes totally agree very mature very wise I'm growing big eyes this isn't my paper isn't over yeah oh this is what I did and she did an amazing job she did an amazing job making it darker but I do regret my decision I've literally never cried on my channel so much for a hot girl summer makeover I've like never cried on my channel so I just have a mental breakdown for like 15 minutes because it's kind of a big change and I wasn't expecting to go darker today but we tested a bunch of strands in my hair and my hair was too weak to go lighter like I wanted to um and she was super good about testing it to make sure I didn't like self-sabotage and then bleach my hair and then it all fall out and become really unhealthy which was amazing so I'm really grateful that she's educated because she told me that that was not a good idea so spontaneously I was like hey you know what I've been wanting to go darker a little bit so like maybe we should just do that now I was gonna wait till the end of summer to dye my hair darker but I was like you know what let's do it now we're here so now here we are she did an amazing job let me emphasize on that I don't want to make the hair stylist look bad cuz she was amazing and she was so sweet but I did have a mental breakdown just because it's such a big change and because I wasn't like expecting to look at this I don't hate it though now that it's kind of growing on me I FaceTime my mom and my friends and they said it makes me look older which I need cuz I look seven years old I'm gonna take a deep breath let's go inside to my apartment let's do a hair make well my hair is already done we'll do makeup will change into an outfit this is still hot girl summer makeover it's a big commitment okay hot girl summer is a big emotional roller coaster okay this is just part of it I don't hate it you know what I don't hate it I'm sorry that you guys had to see me cry like that although I think that it was about time you guys saw me cry but anyway let me know if you guys like it or not if you don't like it I won't be offended because I made this decision this was my choice um I had hair color like this like a year ago and so here we are I was really sad cuz I feel like it didn't match my personality I feel like I'm not like a dark haired girl but now that I'm like looking at myself in the viewfinder I feel like it's not it's actually cute okay I'm sure I don't know if you want to go follow the girl who did my hair is at Fernandez beauty salon she's really talented and she did exactly what I asked for even though half the time what you asked for in life ends up making you have a mental breakdown I think that's like how life works being a teen girl works so there's that uh but let's go inside and do makeup and stuff let's give ourselves a makeover so that we can feel good in our skin right guys [Music] this is not a very hot girl summer outfit in my opinion so we need to change my hair is like so dark before we do makeup let's change into an outfit and then we'll do makeup and then we'll see if I look better than before okay let's change kind of late summary and fun so I have these cute denim shorts and then I have this cute top I feel like I'm a flowy summery gal isn't p-dog cute speaking of my top my top is from Bromley and actually this video is sponsored by wrong way thank you for all my for sponsoring today's video I used

thank you romwe for sponsoring this video they have everything you need for back-to-school and even if want to do a summer hot girl summer makeover of your own go pick up some stuff from romwe okay to finish off makeover this has been an emotional roller coaster I really am excited right now to just sit down and talk to you guys while I do my makeup shall we talk about my mental breakdown or should we just act like it didn't happen I'm actually really glad it's about time that I showed a mental breakdown on my channel you know what I mean sometimes changing up your look can freak you out and that's what happened to me actually the more I look at my hair the more I actually really like it so I think I was just being impulsively upset because it was just like kind of scary for me to like look in the mirror and see that I was now a brunette you know what hot girl summer is about embracing what you have okay and right now I'm brunette and I'm gonna accept that you know I mean and that's okay today has been a journey I just primed my face now I'm going to add some stuff highlights makes your face look glowy I think I don't really know how to do makeup so we're just gonna kind of wing it today I'm not gonna follow a tutorial or anything cause I feel like that's usually when I [ __ ] myself over whereas if I just wing it then I feel like it turns out better just gonna use random colors this is like a BB cream type of thing I don't really know what that even means but I'm also gonna try to do my makeup as quickly as possible because in my opinion hot girl summer is all about getting ready quick so that you can go out on the town and be yourself I don't even feel like summer [ __ ] happened this year and it's kind of depressing cuz I feel like I didn't do anything why is the lighting so bad flip over to this side that's worse like what do I do like why is the lighting so bad like what the [ __ ] I'm still having a midlife crisis that my hair is dark now so like I'm sorry if I'm acting [ __ ] insane like it's just I don't know how to act because I'm kind of panicking a little bit I think the thing is like at the end of the day I don't really care what other people think like if people hate it's more about if you like it right like so I if I change something about myself as long as I like it then I don't usually care I'm not explaining what I'm doing as I'm getting ready / putting on makeup because there's other YouTube channels for that I mean I'm not good at that so I'm not gonna be explaining what I'm doing gonna do my eyebrows now I literally have never learned how to do my eyebrows properly so I just use brow gel but I don't even know like if I know how to use brow gel properly even though brow gels so easy to use it doesn't even have instructions oh [ __ ] like how do you [ __ ] brow gel up I'm Anna jaddu it everytime I can they adapt in my eyebrow what the [ __ ] when did that happen like am I even doing a good job like I could be [ __ ] this up so bad and I wouldn't even know like this isn't even an eyelid brush and I'm using it on my eyelid like that's a problem maybe I'll put a little bit of glitter in my life I'm doing I look ugly as [ __ ] okay that's not the spirit you know what hot girl summer isn't about how you look on the outside but it's about how you treat others and how you feel on the inside I am so lazy when it comes to contouring like what even am i doing I don't know like it's not even a good job like I don't care I look like a different person oh god I'm having a midlife crisis this is what all the 50 year olds talk about what I'm going through right now Jesus [ __ ] dang it now I look to blush okay whatever one time I was using an eyelash curler this one to be exact actually had mascara on my eyes when I was curling my lashes and so then when I pulled the lash curler off my eye I pulled out like half of my eyelashes into this day my eyelashes have like some scarce areas because of that to finish off this very very brief look I'm gonna be using this Fenty Beauty lip gloss okay you think I look the same as I did before but that's fine guys makeup is done I things done what a [ __ ] journey we had today okay I was just expecting this video to be so chill like Oh Emma just goes and gets her hair done and then comes home and does her makeup and then everything's fine or whatever actually at this point comment down below if you comment down below whether or not you like my hair I expect you to lie to me and tell me you like it cuz I'm Way too fragile right now I'm also not gonna take off that little piece of mascara on my face cuz I don't [ __ ] care now it's time for the final reveal of my hot girl summer makeover 20:19 challenge let's see how I look if I look better than before or if I look worse or if I just looked like a little bit more put together version of me before okay let's see I don't have a mirror near me so I actually don't know and you know and I don't so let me know I probably should have done it before clip showing what I look like before this cuz now like what's the difference I think that's it for today's video that was um an emotional roller coaster and now I'm brunette I hope you guys enjoyed I hope you guys have fun sorry you want to see me cry I promise next week there will be no crying in my video no promises actually I'm emotionally unstable I need to hear not the camera or else things are gonna get crazy okay I love you guys thank you so much for watching there's more to you and who you are than your hair you have more going for you than your hair so you get a hair style that you feel like doesn't match your personality or maybe you accidentally shave up your eyebrow remember that it doesn't really matter at the end of the day because as long as you're a good person in here that's all that matters and that's what hawkgirl's summer is being yourself and being your best self and not having a mental

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-08-25T22:41:43Z,320668,7242648,13733,[Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm having a really bad hair day let's like address the elephant in the room here don't ask me what's going on I tried to braid my hair I tried to put it in a bun I tried to put it in a ponytail I like wanted to basically shave it off my head but I decided that was a bad idea and so now we have this situation going on it's not good and I know that but we're gonna continue the video anyways okay so recently I've been cooking for myself like every day which is crazy round of applause I never used to cook for myself I would literally order pose mates for every meal for like a year but recently I realized that was bad for my health and also cooking's fun so I've been doing a lot of cooking recently but I don't tend to cook things that are very complicated I feel like I always just cook easy stuff so I wanted to challenge myself today to cook like a fun a fun dinner that's like more than two steps to cook like something a little bit more complex we're making a nice balanced meal we're gonna make some Brussels sprouts even though for some reason everyone hates Brussels sprouts I don't really see the issue I don't know why they're so bad but we're gonna make Brussels sprouts and we're gonna make roasted chickpeas because I also love chickpeas they're kind of underrated and then we're gonna make some ruts happy I feel like when I cook for myself I tend to cook healthier because it's like easier not like it's not easier but it's like I might as well you know what I mean I'm putting the Morgan to it might as well we get healthy so we're gonna cook I'm not gonna do the first u-haul but I am gonna show you that I got more plums tryi one Wow I didn't even wash it that's not good okay let's get cooking I'm gonna start with the Brussels sprouts okay don't use knives like I do I'm not like very you know safe oh my God my biggest pet peeve is when I have to walk oh god this is gonna be a problem Declan update she's doing I'm amazing okay that's a [ __ ] ton of Brussels sprouts holy [ __ ] I've been really enjoying cooking recently and it's been like fun or whatever but the problem is is that I don't think I'm very good at it and what makes me think that is that like every time I cook it always like comes out tasting like not as good as I wanted it to I usually end up kind of disappointed so I'm hoping that today is gonna be good because I'm like following a recipe becoming an adult becoming a woman I mean I am a mother now cuz I'm Declan you know while I'm doing this I want to have a drink cuz I'm a little thirsty so I bought this young coconut I look like a schoolboy right now I see it a lot of things I still do but I used to hate coconut and I am obsessed with them now oh my oh my god I'm gonna start buying these that is delicious I probably should have planned better with these Brussels sprouts and I probably shouldn't have chosen to make Brussels sprouts at all because I'm having to cut them all into tiny pieces and clean them up and it is a whole ordeal but my mom used to make this for me she's leaving Brussels sprouts every week and then I'd like eat them all week food breath and she would like peel every single Brussels sprout for me every single week she's too good of a woman honey mom one of the reasons why I like cooking on camera is because I used to love cooking shows you name it anything on Food Network I was watching diners drive-ins and dives I loved Cupcake Wars I loved chopped I hope people know these shows or else I'm just [ __ ] talking about something nobody knows about they made me relaxed weirdly like there's certain like TV shows that make me anxious for example oh my god my strange addiction on TLC that show gave me anxiety whereas anything on Food Network made me feel happy calm collected there's a lot of things I think I shouldn't been watching when I was younger like I literally I watched like Alfred Hitchcock movies when I was like 7 what I've learned from this experience is that once you kind of get in the rhythm of like cutting up veggies we can be kind of meditative I mean it would be nice if like you could get Brussels sprouts pre-cut like this maybe you can if you can't I'm going to start that confident company do not take the idea please now that these oh wait I need to preheat the oven I've never made this recipe before but my mom sent it to me so if mom likes it then it's probably good set the oven don't [ __ ] literally Declan is sitting on the floor right by my feet it's like he wants me to step on and I gotta go move him so that he can't you know cooking is dangerous when you have pets I feel like he's gonna like get into something I'll start mixing this up oh my god he's crazy you know I did some lemon pepper that might be too much or too little I don't know get out and olive oil I'm just gonna do a lot you're gonna do some lemon juice okay that was a lot I don't know if that was too much I'm starting to lose hope I need more olive oil oh that was also doing why is he being crazy what is that oh my god what is that you're crazy maybe a spoon these look great look at that [ __ ] look at those Brussels now we need to make our chickpeas this is gonna be a little bit easier the Brussels sprouts is kind of like the Brussels sprouts is the hard part the chickpeas is easy let me remind you you could make these recipes even though I'm not telling you how to make anything so you can't really do the recipe but you could make this meal for your significant others parents because this is a classy meal alright I'll shut up now let's get to work while I'm cooking though before I start my chickpeas I want it I did I did a thing on I bought a bunch of like healthy chips and salsa so that I could eat chips and salsa while I cook because in my family for some reason everybody likes to eat chips and salsa while they cook is that just me I don't know it's weird got some salsa here don't know if it's good never gonna try did don't care these ones aren't coconut flour tortilla chips my expectations are low I don't hate it okay actually about two types of salsa and I want to try both I give the comb enough power once I get 4 out of 10 on a good day what about these cauliflower tortilla chips old foods is crazy the [ __ ] that you can find in there oh so what is my hair doing like what's this hair doing Kyle our tips are good and I give these an 8 out of 10 no that's no good ok [ __ ] those coconut flour chips these suck last but last but not least these are the these are the siete lime chips great free whatever I've actually had these before I know that they're good these ones way okay but back to come again chick me time this is so easy it's really easy I've never known how to properly use a can opener ever definitely not one of my strong suits yeah I'm washing off my beans cuz I'm supposed to do that I guess beans full oh my god see I'm not even gonna be hungry once I'm done cooking cuz I meet so many chips I don't know why I always put so many my mouth at once that's what she said olive oil salt pepper I'm not measuring I'm so sorry I'm literally so sorry I know I'm supposed to be measuring but I'm just not cuz like I really don't care that looks great let's mix it around where's my why are you losing things it's so crazy how like being a parent means you have to kind of know how to cook you know what I mean like if you're a parent and you don't know how to cook you are gonna get roasted at the PTA meetings I fix my hair like this is so ugly what is this okay I'm changing my hair I have bad hair days like once every two days then we're left with this could I just give up my god is that great oh look at that I'll pop this in the oven whoo what's holding me back I was so intimidated by the idea of cooking and this really isn't that hard it's actually really good and nice and fun look at the eggs it's [ __ ] amazing pop in the oven okay originally I was gonna make rice with this I even bought my favorite rice from my childhood this is the whole-grain Spanish rice this was like my favorite food like this I don't know why and I haven't eaten it since I was like literally seven but we'll do this in another episode of making dinner if this ever happens again who knows probably not so now we wait let's take a look at my kitchen looks I mean it's not too messy these are gonna be a [ __ ] to clean but whatever before I go lay in my bed while this stuff cooks I bought this honeycomb and I've always wanted to eat honeycomb so let's try and see if it's good I've always wanted to try it I mean it tastes good it's just like way too sweet for me lesson learned this was fun though I'll see you guys when it's done I'm gonna be eating my chips and salsa it's ready [Music] everybody there's ready look at my masterpiece yummy let's try it out I'll be the judge maybe Chitty oh those are good oh my god they're really good definitely try these a great form and source of protein for us vegetarians out there this meal is vegan I'm proud it's like the first time I've ever cooked for myself and it's worked out I'm turning into a woman now it's time to dry the Brussels sprouts smells good actually no way these are good tips Wow guys I can look this is crazy not to mention I eyeballed everything question is what am i a never desert well you dis let's talk what's going on in my life uh ok literally nothing to talk about but let me just talk about these Brussels sprouts actually I did not expect them to be good cuz like Brussels sprouts take forever to cook and usually like they don't end up being that good but I did a good ass job maybe I'm not so bad after all those are making this [ __ ] every week I'm gonna be so healthy I'm gonna like live til I'm 90 this was a necessary part of my development though because if I want to be a mom one day I need to at least know how to make something like how am I supposed to host dinner parties you know anything that's like the whole point of like being an adult this dinner doesn't look as good as it tastes though it's good for what it is like Brussels sprouts don't taste like macaroni and cheese I wish they did but they don't I don't look good when I eat like some people look good when they eat I'm not one of those what is that anyway let's get dessert I deserve it I work hard tonight Oh milk ice cream this stuff shouldn't be legal this is what keeps me going it's so good there's like chunks of like oatmeal cookie literally midnight right now I'm gonna do go to bed hope you guys have a great day I hope I hope life's treating you alright thank you guys for watching this I hope you had fun I did I mean now I have like leftovers for at least 3 days this is like amazing catch me on Food Network just kidding actually that would be really fun Food Network if you're watching this put me on chopped as a contestant thank you guys for watching I love you guys have an amazing day be yourself follow your dreams and keep it real oh yes my oh no let me get that man to say goodbye I'm obsessed with him I can't stop like talking about him let me have him wave is do you know what I'm not gonna force him to do that he's he's too cute bye guys [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-08-18T22:00:09Z,364147,8455904,17509,[Music] [Applause] hi [Music] apparently the trendy team girl thing to do these days is to make summer bucket lists they look like this they're like hand drawn their handwriting is perfect there's colors and stuff and because I'm a team and you know a lot of people like to say that I'm actually a quirky teen and I am I'm a team and so it just makes sense that I would also come up with this summer bucket list and I check that [ __ ] off as summer goes along and I would have the best summer ever right because I see everyone else doing it and now I want to do it here's the plan okay game plan tonight I'm going to make a very cute and colorful summer bucket list and I'm gonna get some ideas from people in line because there's no way I can come up with a [ __ ] on my own tomorrow I'm gonna spend the whole day trying to do every activity on my summer bucket list in one day because guess what I don't have time to waste summer is almost over so I'm going to just do all of the activities in one day that's all my summer bucket list okay first thing we need we need to get we have a lot to do I have my art supplies I have been kind of feeling like this whole summer that it hasn't really been summer it's been making me really [ __ ] sad I feel like doing this is gonna help me feel better about the fact that I haven't done [ __ ] this summer because I'm just gonna do a bunch of it tomorrow and it will help me make up for lost time the people who make these summer bucket list wait I'm focusing hold on yo I [ __ ] it up that bucket looks like [ __ ] doesn't look that bad okay I'm Way too good at this hello I look like all of the all of wow I'm killing it okay okay before I get inspiration from online because there's no way I'm to be able to come up with these activities myself I'm gonna write a few down that I know that I'm gonna want to do you know first one I'm gonna write okay why do I have no ideas okay we need to go we need to do research I actually can't come up with this [ __ ] on my own drive-in movie go-karting trip to the zoo paddleboarding photoshoot beach volleyball um strawberry picking grow a garden host a large bonfire fly a kite I think you get the idea but that's actually fun I'm always like really judgmental I'm like I don't like corny stuff but sometimes doing corny stuff is fun first thing on my summer Regulus I want to make popsicles I used to do this when I was younger it was really fun so let's bring it back Oh somebody said roast marshmallows that's kind of fun oh my god should I make s'mores that is so summer I don't know if I want it mmm no okay you know what going on a hike could be good oh my god tie-dye oh that's fun maybe I could paint something I'm not to do a lot of shopping for this water balloon fight now that's fun how the [ __ ] do you fill up water balloons I don't know but - I'll figure that out tomorrow I'll hit oh my god I'm already reading this and I do not want to go in a Heidi okay do you want I'm you stop being negative it's good for me to do things like that make a pillow for that could be that could be fun doing yoga I'm taking polaroid photos that could be fun to add to the list I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do all this in one day but that's the goal making a garden that'd be good I will never water the plants though whatever the [ __ ] that even means like making a garden like I live in an apartment oh you know what could be cute if I try a new coffee shop I know I literally just made a video called trying all the coffee shops in LA but I don't care I have not tried all the coffee shops that exist so maybe tomorrow we'll try a new my summer buggy lanes I'm gonna get an early night's rest so that tomorrow I can accomplish everything that I'm trying to accomplish see you tomorrow I just found parking right in front of the establishment this never happens in LA this is good luck I think we're gonna have a great day I think this is great luck I just cracked my phone look at this [ __ ] I was getting out of my car and my phone fell on the ground and it crashed so I'm gonna add to the bucket list to get a new phone [ __ ] okay this place is good okay good I usually don't find good coffee when I try new coffee shops but you know why this place is great gotta check off the bucket list where's my pen let's talk about this crack your phone check let's go home and get started does a killer transition I'm already in workout clothes and doing yoga is one of the activities on your so why don't we do some yoga I don't even have a yoga mat I don't think I need a yoga mat okay let's do yoga lift the back of your [Music] say the arms forward now we're gonna move our hips back it was enough Yoga for me that was about five minutes of yoga I think we're good with that Yoga [ __ ] ooh you know we should do next we should make popsicles because those are gonna take like four hours to freeze okay so I had a little issue at the store today I was at Target and I was like yo do you guys have popsicle makers I asked like three different staff members and all of them told me different answers and long search where I didn't find any so we're gonna have to kind of DIY this situation today but that's kind of fun right I'm thinking we do a little strawberry banana popsicle that could spice up the flavor that's [ __ ] sticky I'm sorry let's see if it even tastes good delicious yes I love what I got [ __ ] things up okay so I was thinking I could use these coffee cups hello this is gonna double as a tutorial this is how you make homemade popsicles although this might actually go bad once you have your smoothie in the bowl tap out all the air this is where the DIY hack comes in take tinfoil put tinfoil over each one I'm a cooking channel now I'll take some wooden forks don't ask me why I have these there oh my god this is stuck these are gonna be such great popsicle we're gonna have to come back to these because obviously you have to put them in the freezer but like later we're gonna eat these it's gonna be our vibe okay so excited about that you know what see if this is why making corny ass [ __ ] lists is good because it inspired me to do something I wouldn't normally done I'm gonna have to check off make popsicles like I'm not gonna do a fall checkmark I'm just gonna half check it so that I still feel like I accomplished something just now cuz if not I'm gonna feel bad about myself I haven't here make a garden I bought this succulent making kit so that I can make myself a succulent so that I can have cool house decoration first step okay that was easy oh this is too easy we won't have instant results that's kind of sad but whatever yeah I place the moss on top wait and now I just put it in a window and it's gonna grow guys okay let's find a window where would this look cute right here kind of looks awkward in this window right here it's just like right there but I think it's cute okay success make a garden check make a pillow fort okay ah this is working too well holy [ __ ] whoa I love this wait we need snacks this might be my favorite activity yet I need some nuts that's what she said okay let's have a debate what are the best type of nuts I think almonds might be the best cashews are pretty good too though you know I think the best nut is all them in your mouth combined I just put a handful of random-ass and nuts in my mouth I think that she's better than any not individually that's just my opinion I think I've spent enough time in this for let's get out of here although when I'm done filming this I will be coming back in here okay oh my god that's childbirth that's what childbirth looks like you just crossed off make a pillow for it so that's good paint a picture okay my dad is an artist in case you guys didn't know that doesn't really matter because I'm still really shitty at painting drawing all of the above I mean I'm not the worst but I'm definitely not as good as I should be spoiler alert I'm painting I'm painting a plum because you know what these things are too damn good okay plums are so good this year plums have been killing it that kind of looks like a plum what if I turn the plum into a super heat and stupid ooh that looks nice Wow okay guys ready for the big reveal now I can check off paint a picture check I'm gonna go take a nap and then we'll finish the rest of these later today how does that sound you don't have a choice okay okay I'm away came to keep going okay I'm sorry I look a little bit I look like I took a nap okay let's see what we need to do next I wrote go on a hike on here but I really I'm not gonna do that so start a Polaroid wall okay this is great I can do this I think I have a Polaroid okay okay wait I definitely didn't lose my okay we'll use this one you know most people don't one they like make it Polaroid walls they take a bunch of photos with their friends or take a bunch of photos of their friends the problem is I am alone so I'm just gonna take Polaroids of myself maybe all the sequin of just my plums cuz they're just so beautiful it's what they deserve I could take some photos in my fort oh maybe I could do a one flipping off the camera cuz I'm a savage hold on let's find some cool backgrounds let's spice things up maybe like in front of my fridge I definitely just took enough Polaroids to feel like seven walls so look at all this now let's go hang them up hold the ride wall time where am I gonna put this you're the front door and there's a blank wall right here so I think this needs a little bit of spice anyway so now I'm gonna lie the photos didn't turn out the best like some of them were good and then some of them kind of turned out dark like this but you know what I had fun so I'm just gonna use them anyway [Music] okay here's my Polaroid wall that's not cute okay I've already decided that I don't want to go for a hike so I'm just gonna check it off as if I did it that defeats the whole purpose of a bucket-list if you don't want to do it then why'd you put it on your bucket list and that's the question I'm asking myself another thing I put tie-dye on here I don't really want to do that again so we are just gonna check that off and act like it happened even though it didn't actually I wanted to tardive but they didn't have tired eye stuff I'm at Target and that's the only store I went to so that's not happening I live in an apartment so roasting marshmallows for me means roasting them on a stove which is a little bit worrisome because I have a gas stove so I don't know if that's unsafe should I not do that I'll try it one poisonous marshmallow won't kill you right everything's ready let's get let's do this oh [ __ ] I'm never patient enough to fully Rose my marshmallows so I just like burn it on accident oh my god it's summer look at that s'more oh wow that was great would have been cooler if I had like a bonfire of some sort but you know what we were below we have house 1 roasting marshmallows check water balloon fight how am I gonna do a water balloon fight by myself umm we'll find out let's do it [ __ ] okay June 1 don't do that don't do a water balloon fight with yourself it's just disappointing and you're just gonna be embarrassed to finish off this video and to complete our last bucket list item we're gonna eat my popsicle oh it's not fully frozen open it's falling off the stick no oh wait okay that's better you have to check off our last item make it popsicles check Wow although making a summer bucket list is a little bit corny I don't hate it if you take anything from this video it's that number one you need to make this smoothie almond milk peanut butter banana strawberry so good oh and definitely make a [ __ ] fort in your living room I'm gonna chill in here for the rest of the day I literally feel so relaxed in here anyway I'll shut up now okay well thank you for watching I hope you guys are having a great summer and if you live in like Australia where it's like winter I hope you're having a great winter all right I love you guys see you later okay bye [Music]

-emma chamberlain",2019-08-11T20:28:14Z,475784,8583161,52688,[Music] [Applause] oh [ __ ] too far too far okay hi [Music] i live alone um living alone is great it's pretty much the only way to do it in my opinion um until i get married i'm probably gonna live alone and that's fine i like that but you know it does get a little bit lonely around here i feel like it would be nice if i had a pet one time i called an energy reader don't ask i was like what do you what should i what what do you think would be good for me to do in my life like what give me some advice the energy reader told me i should get a pet i called my parents and both of them were like absolutely not well they told me not to get a dog there's just like no way i can have a dog because it's just it's a lot of work there's a lot of training that goes into it there's a lot of like maintenance whatever and i'm a busy gal even though i'm home a lot i'm still kind of busy whatever it's just not a good idea for me to get a dog but a cat is not is a little bit less high maintenance right i was always anti getting a cat because cats can be really moody and like unpredictable and [ __ ] and it's like hard to find a good cat you know what i mean but recently i was on this adoption website and i saw this cat this photo of a cat that looks exactly like my cat from home named oliver i immediately was like i need to meet this kitten like i need to he was like my best friend like i loved him more than i even loved my dogs but don't tell my dogs that but like i love that cat but when i moved to la the cat oliver couldn't come with me because he kind of had was all settled in at my mom's apartment like i didn't want to rip him out of his life you know what i mean i'm gonna go potentially adopt a cat right now um i have this weird like emotional spiritual calling to this cat that i found on the adoption website and it's a rescue cat which is awesome because there's so many cats and dogs but especially cats that are in these shelters that don't have homes so it's really good to rescue if you're gonna ever get an animal rescue i always rescue my animals anyways i don't know if we're gonna get along but today we're gonna go see maybe i'll end up finding a different cat that i bond with who knows but i weirdly have a calling to this cat and i just called a few minutes ago and asked if the cat was still available and he was his name is baby boy currently uh we will definitely be renaming him if i adopt him but anyway we might literally go and i meet the cat and we don't get along and then this whole video will just be scrapped but if we do get along then we're in for a [ __ ] treat today because [Music] [Applause] this is a big commitment but i think i'm ready it's like having a child like it gives you something to nurture and take care of and love and it's always there for you and it will never stab you in the back anyway let's go to the adoption center hopefully we get along it's like trying to find your soulmate on match.com very unpredictable but could work out no one knows about this so it's kind of like i feel like i'm going undercover it's gonna be kind of weird if my friends come over later and they're like so what's this [ __ ] cat and i'm gonna be like well it's mine i mean i don't want to jinx anything but it's kind of nerve-wracking because like you don't know if you're going to get along with the animal that's why i don't understand how people can like like or like they can order animals online okay that kind of sounds sucks but like you know when people they buy the dog before they even meet the dog like i don't know if people do that i would be nervous that me and that animal wouldn't get along it's like chemistry it's like being in a relationship with like another human being except as an animal so it's not a interrelate it's not the same but it's like kind of the same like you have to click with the animal you know but either way i'm i'm excited like even if i just meet the cat and even if it's not a good experience at least i got to pet a cat right okay see you at the adoption center i am here the adoption center is right here um i'm gonna film with my iphone when i'm in there because i don't want them to get scared by my big camera because sometimes i feel like establishments don't like youtubers um as they [Music] shouldn't i can't believe i'm doing this right now oh my god look at what we have here meat fettuccine oh my god what did i just do his name is fettuccine but i want to rename him because fettuccine is not a good name originally i was saying i wanted to get a gray cat because it looked like my cat from home named oliver but i end with this little guy because i felt like we bonded really well i feel like i now have a child i feel like we're really connected as one we're kind of like a unit look at his cute little face sorry i hate baby talk i will stop now literally like what do i name him what's it called gave him the name fettuccine so what if i name him [Music] something italian to go along with the fact that his name is fettuccine mario no i could name him luigi nope okay keep trying comment down below and i should name him because i like genuinely don't know he kind of looks like a simon but i don't really like that name so hey i'm gonna have to leave you in the cage for now okay buddy boy ew why am i talking to this cat so weird to just see buckled him in time to bring him home and see how it goes i can't believe i just did that i'm [ __ ] crazy that was literally one of the most spontaneous things i've literally ever done okay time to go home um yeah okay i'm home i'm in my guest bathroom right now and we're gonna let little guy out don't have a name for him yet what do you think okay so i need to get some supplies for him i have a few things um like some like a litter box and some food balls hi hi okay get some water okay let's set up this litter box just so he doesn't [ __ ] you know what's crazy about cats that i didn't know is that cats don't need to be potty trained which is [ __ ] amazing so that's good um excited about that um i'm also allergic to cats a tiny bit you're probably like emma why did you get a cat if you're allergic to them because i'm [ __ ] lonely i grew up with a cat and it was not a problem as long as i was taking my allergy meds so it's just a little life adjustment it's whatever i am already having allergies though which is a slight issue cat litter my favorite food all right so we're pretty set up here as you can see we got all the things we're gonna need you like your new home the lighting in here is shitty but here's me and bae oh i need allergy medicine holy [ __ ] we need to go to the pet store okay the cat wasn't gonna be part of the family unless my friends met the cat right [Music] i'm choosing between the name riley and the name declan i think declan guys bring declan riley over here what do we like better one two three declan okay you guys are gonna scare him declan now we have a name declan is in the bathroom uh eating dinner and while i have him contained i thought i would do a little haul of everything i bought at petco my friends were nice enough to go with me to the pet store so that i could buy [ __ ] for him because i needed moral support okay kitty beds um don't know where i'm gonna put these yet to be determined poop bags litter box mat i got two new litter box that is very technologically advanced okay i got a [ __ ] ton of toys favorite thing i got a collar it has little ducks on it also i'm sorry he's crying in the bathroom right now because i left him in there to eat so that he wasn't roaming around my apartment because he's not fully equipped to be doing so yet so anyway i got this magnet for my fridge that says catitude this was an impulse buy i don't have any regrets i'm gonna go put it on my fridge more toys and more toys oh my god these cute marble balls come on more toys more toys more toys like hello can we like cool it on the toys oh i got in this thing you hang on the door so they can scratch fun and then i bought him food but you guys don't care about that so let's go check up on him let's see how he's doing how you doing come here cute let's see he didn't eat any of his food yet so that's bad but okay wow do you hear that purr one of my main concerns with this little guy was that he wasn't gonna like me um because if you think about it when you get a cat like you know you guys can have chemistry in the kitty store but you never know if like it's gonna be a good vibe when you get home but so far i think he likes me did he pee on the floor my question is like do i let him sleep in my bed tonight or not he wants to come out and explore my apartment i'm kind of nervous oh my god he's my new bestie come over here okay he doesn't care about me now it's hard being a new mom like do i just let him run around my apartment or is that like a bad idea sorry okay it is late it's like midnight i look um [ __ ] like a mess so far vibes have been really good with declan uh we're chilling everything's good like i don't know what he's doing right now i'm letting him sleep in my room tonight i set up as you can see we got a little you know litter box water food the whole nine yards we got a little toy mouse rat thing right there um i don't know where he is where is he oh there he is cookie we are together oh my god okay he hates me um okay look how cute his little collar is wait can you see it okay that was a terrible angle of my armpit that i don't know if i should he ate a little bit of his dinner i mean he's been so loving and affectionate with me which is amazing as you can see look at him he's very adventurous as you can see he's like walking all over me okay well i'm gonna go to bed i don't know how it's gonna go with him like i don't know if he's gonna want to play when i want to sleep like aren't cats nocturnal nocturnal like do they even sleep so i'm gonna go to bed um and i'll let you know how it goes hopefully he sleeps and it's not a problem and if it is a problem i will keep you guys updated it's like having a newborn um good night oh i forgot to turn off my bathroom light [ __ ] okay now good night good morning declan i almost forgot his name again for the 100th time first night went amazing literally like great i slept the whole night he didn't bother me at all i did wake up and my water bottle was spilled over like he probably tried to climb on my nightstand one of my plants fell over overall um i think he's doing really great so far and i think we're gonna be besties for life so welcome declan to the family i hope you guys like them that was kind of an adventure that i wasn't expecting i think i'm getting sick but i also might just be allergic to declan that's it for today's video i hope you guys had fun this inspires you to go get a little pet rescuing is really good so i recommend it well more more collabs with declan are coming so get excited also if you hate his name or if you like it comment down below i would like to know your opinion even if you hate it i won't get offended but it's too late now i already named him so okay bye guys okay have a good day guys have a good day bye [Music] bye you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-08-04T23:35:47Z,320734,6711732,15322,[Music] [Applause] [Applause] hi [Music] good morning I have to fart I'm not going to do it though I've been farting too much of my videos and then people have been commenting that I have bad manners but I don't have bad manners I just have gas it's summer oh my god no summer is like almost over which is terrifying because I feel like I haven't been living it up this summer like I did the summers in the past I've gone on no trips I've barely gone to the beach like I've barely done anything summery and it's making me so sad because I was looking forward to summer for months then it came around and then I was like booop I don't want to do anything everyone in my life has busy lives okay which is great for them but it's kind of sad for me because if I want to like do summer activities you know everyone's busy and [ __ ] I'm taking it upon myself to have a fun summer day by myself I think it's really important to be able to have fun days by yourself when I used to live at home I used to be really great at that I could literally go [ __ ] hang out by myself I can hang out by myself for a week straight and not be sad whereas now I'm like I'm more reliant on other people okay this is this like therapy session why am I like just talking about my feelings right now since I've moved to LA I feel like I've been more like dependent on other people like I don't like to do things by myself as much and I'm trying to become more independent again because I was more independent when I was like 15 now I'm like always like oh little people I don't want to be running so [ __ ] that we're having a [ __ ] summarize data and it's gonna be amazing so I just got back from SoulCycle as you can tell by my [ __ ] ass leggings that literally say la on them if you guys didn't think la changed me before look at these [ __ ] leggings today we're gonna go to the beach but first I need a snack recently I've been obsessed with plums I don't know what it is but plums are so good not all these are plums there are some other fruits in here as well like this is like the nectarine maybe it's actually going bad I think but plums dude they're in season in there [ __ ] wait I need a napkin they are so good these are crazy oh why are they so good the only problem is I can eat like 40 of these in one sitting like I once they start I cannot stop with healthy food it's never like I want to be eating it like I've never like excited about eating it but like with plums Wow Wow I ate my snack I have my coffee now let's go to the beach before we go to the beach let me tell you about one thing I got a GoPro so that I could record myself while at the beach I'm gonna be like this in the ocean it's gonna be amazing okay let's go to the beach [Music] we are on our way to the beach it is [ __ ] it's a hundred degrees sitting fun little thing that I'm mentioning I'm gonna mention the more I'm in the Sun the better my skin gets okay it's not a myth it's not a joke it's the truth like if I go to the beach multiple times in a week which never happens when it does happen my skin gets so good I feel at home now I cannot stop wearing huge glasses I was just driving and then I drove past this place they had this like stand that said coffee and avocado toast I was like oh I'm going cuz I'm actually hungry I didn't eat enough food and I'm gonna be in the ocean for a while so I needed I need a solid meal before we go out into the ocean so let's go I also need more coffee [Music] I'm gonna this so good I'm back in the cars and I can actually speech because I couldn't speak when I was at that little cafe because um there was people around and they were all like older women and I felt like I was being judged so number one that avocado toast was easily the best abakan it has I've ever had in my entire life that [ __ ] was so good the whole cafe itself was inside of like a steel van and it was so [ __ ] cute so that's my new favorite place anyway I need to get in the water it's way too [ __ ] hot today it's so hot I can't stop sweating ah okay that was really nice you know it--and a little bit I'd be boarded a little bit going to the beach by yourself it's fun because you know you gotta get to like do your own thing and relax and like talk to random people you don't know and [ __ ] like that's fun right I was a little bit nervous being on the beach by myself like I just felt nervous I felt like I was being judged and to be completely honest I was I didn't wear my shoes out to the beach because I'm wearing tennis shoes so I didn't wear shoes on to the beach and the sand was literally 400 degrees it was so hot I was burning my feet really bad so as I was running down the beach every like a few seconds I'd have to throw my boogie board onto the ground and jump on doing I looked really [ __ ] stupid in a whole group of teens were staring at me and laughing at me as I was doing this I immediately felt not welcome at the beach but the water felt amazing overall good day good day good summer day I feel tan not really I look the exact same I feel like I need to stop drinking coffee as much during the day cuz it's like bad for my health umm and it's making me sleep like [ __ ] but I really want to get another fills right now and there's a fills kind of near me do I go or not I don't know or maybe I try a new place although I think we've learned that branching out doesn't work for me I think we're gonna go to okay we'll go we'll get okay we're gonna get caught recently I've been a really bad ever and I thought I would tell you guys about what that's been like for me so the other day I was at a stoplight and I was behind a Dodge car I was behind a car okay we were at the stoplight for so long that I put down this thing and I started popping my blackheads in the little mirror thing on the on whatever this thing is called so I accidentally rolled into the car in front of me and tapped their bumper I felt terrible honestly because I'm just an idiot and I like didn't realize I mean it was like not bad I mean no one was hurt or anything but it was just me being stupid my foot wasn't fully on the brakes so I'm an idiot and then yesterday I'm driving and the cop just pulls me over out of nowhere and it's just like you're not being at the driver I was like why he was like you're in the middle of two lanes at once and I was like this cop shouldn't have pulled me over I wasn't doing anything wrong there was like a car in my way so I couldn't like fully like being in the lane I needed to be in like it wasn't my phone told me quote unquote you're driving like you don't know how to drive it hurt my feelings well the story is I've been a bad driver recently I thought I would just share that with you guys okay let's get coffee now third of the day not stopping anytime soon if I ever like go missing or die it's probably because of like some sort of caffeine induced overdose I just saw on Twitter that its national self-care day and if anyone is doing that today it's me I think I want to raise my kids by a beach when I'm older so that they can be good at surfing and be like really tans coffee time around 7:00 [Music] okay I'm going home I'm home I'm gonna make myself some tea I took a shower I took a little nap it's time to like start winding down I am kind of turning into a grandma so I've been going to bed early I went to bed 11:30 last night I'm drinking tea I don't know what my issue is I also can't stop eating plums like when I got home I ate literally ten more plums like I'm running out I want to eat more but I think that it's making my stomach hurt I'm only gonna let myself be ten per day recently I've been eating like 20 plums knowing that I'm getting a visa coconut guys it's summer this is this is summer right here oh [ __ ] it's still hot yeah I give up I don't even like do I even like tea I don't know why I keep drinking what better way to end the day a summer day than with a little bit of skateboarding I'm so cool you know I wanted to kind of call it a night I was like you know it's 8:45 I'm tired I want to kind of just start winding down but [ __ ] that we're gonna go skate why does that always happen when I film [ __ ] I thought I wasn't gonna fart in this fear okay tanned off the day we're gonna skateboard on this roof that I just found I've never heat farting okay I've never been up here before and I just found it and it's like really a nice roof and no one's up here and hopefully I'm allowed to be up here okay you know what I fun skating was fun I guess but I'm going to go to bed because you know what it's nine o'clock yeah I'm kind of done with the day I've been going to bed early recently I'm gonna go have another cup of tea hit the hay do it all again tomorrow thank you guys for watching I hope you had a fun time I definitely did that was a good day for me I had a great day and yeah here's the summer [ __ ] I love you guys peace out [Music]

-emma chamberlain",2019-07-28T19:01:08Z,319299,7479087,16215,[Music] welcome to this summer all-nighter [Music] I am so tired right now okay it's 221 in the morning before I start this video is sponsored by ha mr. I love Foster I always love working with them because when I was younger holster was my favorite store and I could tell my 13 year old self that I was working with holster they would be very excited so it's always a pleasure these jeans are from there this whole outfits actually from there so yeah thank you also for sponsoring today's video link in the description to shop their jean Kollection and all their other fun stuff i think the cameras crooked it's 2:30 a.m. I'm exhausted but we're just getting started alright we are just getting started I used to frequently pull all-nighters I'm talking about like once a week minimum when I used to pull all-nighters it was always for either school or work of some sort like I was always trying to finish a task and that's why I was pulling an all-nighter but he was like never fun but I wanted to have a fun all-nighter today we're gonna be pulling an all-nighter but we're gonna be doing the most fun and epic all-nighter day has ever happened and it's happening right now now that I sleep a good eight hours well let's not let's that's generous now that I sleep a nice 16 hours a night I know you don't pull all-nighters anymore I have no tolerance for saying it like it's 2:00 a.m. and I'm I've lost my personality I don't even know who I am anymore and this is gonna be tough but it's not this is supposed to be fun saving the Turtles let's talk like I consider myself a night owl I don't really think I'm like a morning person I am a morning person when I wake up but like usually I don't wake up so I Zoomers of marine business i like nighttime i like the vibe of nighttime I like how nobody's around I like how the world feels like it feels like a different world you feel I give the world to yourself at night do you know what I mean and I like that my goal is I want to stay awake until the Sun comes up there's a lot of things that are open 24 hours so like I'm gonna check all that [ __ ] out tonight hopefully I explained that well because if I didn't that's all the explaining guys are getting for today me you all-nighter summer 2019 not to mention I haven't done [ __ ] this summer it has not felt like summer for one [ __ ] second this entire summer but silly I'm ready to feel some summer vibes okay okay where are we off to you know I kind of want to check some things off the bucket list there's like a few places I've always wanted to go but I've like never had a reason to go to them one of them is this doughnut slash coffee shop called Winchell's I don't know why I'm so infatuated by this doughnut shop but I Drive past it all the time it's open 24 hours and I never have a reason to in there because there's just no reason to go in there I'm not really the biggest fan of doughnuts but they probably have something in there I get to eat like oh maybe I'll get a doughnut [ __ ] it being in stores or restaurants that are open 24 hours at night it's like a whole new level of what am i [ __ ] talking about I'm literally losing my mind restaurants and stores that are open 24 hours have one of the most unique vibes and feelings that exists and I love it's insane to me how vacant the roads are right now like you will never see this in LA at any other time there's one car one human being Oh okay I actually really like the energy in there it was really calm really relaxed I got my donut and I got myself a nice hot black coffee let's try out the coffee see if it's any good burn my tongue way too bad not bad you know I wanted to sit in there and kind of enjoy myself you know and enjoy the environment but there's a few people in there having some sort of meeting and I'm not gonna lie it kind of intimidated me because I was like okay it's 3:00 and why are these people having a meeting inside of this donut shop at 3:00 I'm like something about it felt weird so I wanted to get out I want to go to a few tourist stops in LA that I normally don't get to go to because they're normally too busy one of them being the legendary pink wall now if you don't know what the legendary pink wall is basically in Los Angeles there is this wall called the pink wall a lot of tourists take photos in front of it when they're in LA because it has good lighting and it's like cute cuz it's like a pink mural so it's very popular getting from one place to another at this hour is too easy I want to hate this I want to hate it but it tastes so good [ __ ] well would you look at where we are it's the pink wall baby okay so I'm here and I don't really know what to do now that I'm here also I can hear the crickets listen well now they were at the pink wall let's let's party I don't even know like I might literally get the police called on me I don't think I'm supposed to have a skateboard out here I don't care pink wall we had fun I do love being outside alone right now they're like wow okay the pink wall was very fun and very exciting because you know I got to see the pink wall in a rare form I want to do more activities like that so guess what we're going next Rodeo Drive Rodeo Drive is where all of the high-end stores are in Los Angeles like there's like they're all on one row I tend to avoid the area but it is 3:30 a.m. and I have nothing to lose so we're going it would be so convenient if half the world was awake only at night and half the earth and half the population was only allowed to be awake during the day if I run for president that will be my selling Quinn and I probably won't get elected how does Rodeo Drive literally look so beautiful at night let's get out of the car this is weirdly so serene like okay it's 3:00 a.m. but it's like super bright out it like this is something I like this is such a weird feeling like I'm really enjoying this you know next time I'm having a mental breakdown I'm going to bring a friend here and I'm going to talk it out with them while walking around on Rodeo Drive why am I like having the best time okay I don't know what the point of that was I did it because I can so every time I burp it tastes like donut I'm not complaining I think I get used to this this is gonna be my new nighttime hangout spot oh my god not to mention the weather is so amazing right now it's like a perfect 70 degrees beautiful we're off to our next place okay I need a few things I need water and I need chapstick I'm pretty sure Rite Aid is open 24 hours so we could go run into a Rite Aid one of my favorite things to do this is very off-topic but one of my favorite things to do while on vacation is go to either Rite Aid or Target or Walmart or one of those places and just go shopping for [ __ ] I don't need I haven't been on vacation in a while though and let me tell you do I need a drink comment down below where I should go we're on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles I don't know why I keep saying we're in Los Angeles obviously we're in [ __ ] Los Angeles I'm definitely being wary right now of my surroundings okay to say the least what am I in here for again I need water and I need chapstick water and chapstick hey guys six cents right at all I got a smart water oh I got the wait they literally forgot to take off the [ __ ] what am I supposed to do with these I got two chopsticks oh nice this one's very vanilla cocoa butter flavor that could be yummy oh that is a nice smell this one's great too I actually like both of those chopsticks equally so holy [ __ ] I'm tired okay I only have like an hour and a half left until the Sun comes up I've done a lot of [ __ ] this whole thing has actually been pretty fun I'm definitely ready to go to sleep I mean as I should be I'm glad that I'm tired because it means that my all-nighter days are over cause like I used to be able to pull an all-nighter with ease and now I can't so that's good okay so I'm actually at the grocery store right now because here's the thing grocery shopping is a [ __ ] pain in the ass in LA the lines are way too long it's so much it's so exhausting it's literally 4:30 a.m. right now if people are grocery shopping right now that's insane although I'm exhausted and like grocery shopping doesn't really sound too appealing for me right now I feel like it would be a productive thing to do let's just get it over with okay I'm actually really glad I got to do this because I'd rather do this one it's not busy than when it is busy so I would do it again for sure I really did have a fun time I'm not gonna lie I enjoyed myself I had a great time I thought it was AI think that this whole experience has been absolutely awesome and I've had a lot of fun but I can taste my bed raisins have been really getting into tea like drinking tea which is weird cuz I'm like the coffee you know like everybody knows me for like coffee but recently I've been really liking tea so I didn't to make myself some tea right now while I wait for the Sun to come up I use this detox tea because I think it helps me poop so yeah it's good I think it's good also I like to put lemon juice in it I think putting lemon in your tea makes it taste way better as you can see it's 5:35 the Sun is gonna start coming up in 15-20 minutes and I'm literally just gonna stand here until it does so I [ __ ] did it sadly there's not a beautiful sunrise right now because it's [ __ ] foggy it's 6:00 a.m. we did it I got to spend some quality time with myself which I've been needing recently actually I've been kind of lonely recently but it was still nice I got to check out some fun [ __ ] cross some things off my bucket list I'd recommend you try it out if you want if it seems fun to you pull it on later with your friends for you know that's good summer activity I need to go to bed really bad so thank you for watching cheers to you thank you to Hollister for sponsoring this video in creating these jeans I love them and they are a great color try to make sure you're drinking water and sleeping seven hours is the golden spot right there and I love you very much thank you for hanging out with me 6 a.m. I love you guys alright peace I'm gonna go the [ __ ] to bed [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-07-22T19:04:28Z,430967,10887171,26692,[Music] [Applause] hi I just spent the last few hours going through every single piece of clothing that I own and deciding whether or not I should keep it I have not done this in a few years and it was very very much needed I'm literally getting rid of half of my closet and if you don't believe me come look at this giddyup okay I'm getting rid of this I'm getting rid of this I'm getting rid of this I'm getting rid of this I'm getting rid of all of this I'm getting rid of these and all of this and this I'm getting rid of like basically half of my closet now you might be like holy [ __ ] Emma that's a lot that's because I've had most of these clothing pieces since eighth grade I have had these brandy melville sweats okay they're just basic writing out of those sweats since eighth grade and they have stains all over them there's a hole in the butt this [ __ ] needs to get here's the thing now that I've cleaned out my closet and I've made a bunch of room in my closet I want to go shopping so tomorrow I'm gonna go shopping and we're gonna basically revamp my closet because I just got rid of so much [ __ ] by the way I'm donating it if you guys have any ideas as to where I should donate all of the clothes that's like a good cause let me know I really like wait oh my gosh farted like I didn't get rid of everything I own but I got rid of a decent portion so tomorrow we're gonna go shopping gonna try to get some cool [ __ ] sorry I'm I'm just not okay hi okay I'm on my way to the mall and so let me tell you kind of what my goal is here today I think my main goal today with shopping is I want to get some pieces that will take me out of my comfort zone a little bit because I already have enough basics in my closet and I need some new stuff that'll spice up my my closet and make it interesting again we're going to a huge mall in Los Angeles and it's kind of far away from where I live but I'm literally driving like an hour to get there so that I will have a lot of options for stores and I can go [ __ ] crazy right now I've only had one coffee today and kind of due for another one ok wait how the [ __ ] this is wait a second oh my god there's literally a [ __ ] Fell's right across the street there's a Phil's right here you literally can't see it because this camera is terrible zoom but might have to get some of that it's shopping time a little bit nervous I get buyer's remorse really bad like when I after I go shopping I always feel like super guilty so like really excited about that oh my god I cried earlier can you tell I'm actually pulling it off really well kind of like sociopathic like you would never know that I was crying like 20 minutes ago actually I was crying like my 10 minutes ago for no reason I love being a woman I love being a teen girl I think I was crying because I was like subconsciously so excited to go shopping I just like got emotional that wasn't actually I'm just a [ __ ] mask shopping I have like 700 tops that look like this but I like one another one no I'm not gonna do that that defeats the whole purpose of today this is this is great Oh what the [ __ ] my these belong okay I'm gonna get this and then we're leaving the store next door I'm gonna go crazy mark my words how does gonna go more crazy but I kind of think it's cuz I already like own the whole store okay we're in Urban Outfitters now let's see if we can do better this time is this cute but I hate how this is a circle these are kind of interesting but it's summer so I can't well he might like I'm the worst shopper ever I just realized because I talked myself out of buying everything welcome to summer camp wait Loki I'm into it oh my god I used to love The Twilight Zone mouth yogurt I will never work this shirt no this actually cute like tucked into like jeans like it could be oh I know oh my god actually with this outfit right now like with work with like hiding this okay this is a vibe I love those colors I'm lucky I'm not mad at these all of these remind me of um LMFAO party rock anthem' insert right here please thank you not the audio that were also get coffee right oh my God look at the little [ __ ] squirrel that's so cute I love him but I feel like everybody was like she's trying too hard to be quirky if I buy that so I think so too soars down Nordstrom where is it like you know what it wouldn't hurt to good okay we're gonna go to Lou lemon then Nordstrom let's let's get it this is a super chill store I think workout clothes it's like an important thing for me to stock up on just because I wear it 90% of the time cuz I'm too lazy to read real clothes and I'd rather just looked like I worked out when I like did in just like because like it's more comfortable do you see I'm saying it's cheating oh these are comfortable wait why is there no there's no it's just there's no seat you know Nate man no no this color oh my god this is where things get good they have such great stock in did it maybe life isn't so bad after all wait these are nice yeah these are nice oh maybe I get sock sweet I do need a new song I love getting new songs it's like my life [Music] right she's so low why am I so excited about thank you by Nordstrom time oh my god shop energy is tiring I wish it would have done someone you're having good film secretly and nordstrom because they hate us they hate me Ellie Goulding's gonna get all my absence everybody was mean to me this is like I mean you're so negative in your videos so I'm gonna try to start collecting more positive I'm not really feeling Nordstrom so let's get the [ __ ] out it I need to have like one more store where I like score in it okay I feel like I didn't look hard enough in brandy melville so I think I'm gonna go back in there because I feel like I could do better in there like I bought one thing you know what I mean I'm gonna work a little bit harder this time and see what happens trying this again what are these oh really it's summer and you know what you need summer oh wait sweats it's always about wait I want more sweats I don't need more sweats no clue is very unique lure gray guys I like this too good facing I already have enough basics in my closet and I need some new stuff that'll spice up my my closet and make it interesting again I like this a good facing that's actually not that long I think this could work should I get this coat or should I get the green one over there or wait or look at that like gray one oh my god I think that's cute I think that's really cute okay I just finished shopping all of the bags are here can you even see that there was some source I couldn't film in so sorry but now I'm gonna go do some damage do you see that pills actually do I even want to go to Phil's right now wait Who am I kidding there's a Phil's across the street from me and I'm asking the question whether or not I should go am i stupid okay [ __ ] now let's go home and let's do a haul I bought a bunch it's like basic [ __ ] like that defeats the whole purpose of literally everything I was doing today I was like I'm in it branch down it's that holy [ __ ] this is gonna take me such a long time to film so let's see what I bought first thing I bought I literally didn't even mean I bought the most boring gray sweatpants the world has ever seen I'm excited about these though because they're very comfortable and I know I'm gonna wear them literally everything I'm not mad about it but it definitely was not necessary the worst part is that I also bought them in blue and I didn't need to do that is there a stain on them what the [ __ ] [ __ ] this is this is huge ok I'm actually I like this even though I mean another thing that's very not interesting but I mean I like it I also thought this in white which like you would think would be like stupid but it's actually not because I don't know any zip ups so this is actually really nice I actually want to need this I love turtlenecks so this was just well this is actually a monk neck sorry I love this and I have no regrets even though I already have like 7 things like it wait do you want to wait hold on this is the same thing I did not need to buy this but they're different materials ok so like it's fine oh my god this is so cute it says cowgirl awning I like it it's simple like whenever I want but I just think it's cute so no regrets also I think of myself as a cowgirl because I went to horse camp when I was younger and I think that makes it so that I can wear this shirt I love this I know that I said I wasn't going to get any more basic pieces but that's kind of all I got so no regrets I know what you're thinking guys Emma this is such a dynamic and interesting haul and I would say you're right I just like buy basic shirts like in pants did I even buy pants I know you're thinking guys this haul just keeps getting more interesting well just when you thought that it couldn't get better look at what I'm about to show you next yay why did I buy so many ladies hip up I promise that's my last tip up I hope it's there holy [ __ ] this top is so cute look how cute it is when I bought this I was like okay I'm probably not gonna like it um but I actually love it Wow you can't go wrong with a good old holter top in the summer I love halter tops because it's great for showing off my back meaning I take everything back I did buy this this is very weird so I think that this actually makes up for all of the pieces I bought that we're basic as [ __ ] okay I got this skirt if I think it's a little bit long so I'm gonna cut it sorry after I cut it be cute so I don't hate it okay the green one benefits better but it's still a little long maybe I'm more likely to wear shorts but I will wear a skirt I got these two things as a combination deal could also be worn separate I've like seen every episode of The Twilight Zone and I am rule I only allow myself to buy like merch first stuff that I'm actually a fan of and so I actually have a Twilight Zone fan so [ __ ] all you guys have got a fake I know it's summer but I love the colors on this Wow okay I almost forgot that I also bought these this might be my best purchase it's just cute okay I love turtlenecks can you not tell it's just very simple come into this this is actually a vintage Mickey Mouse crewneck I love all the letters are different and I think it's so cute I really didn't need a hoodie though because it is summer but do you know what I didn't need this but I'm obsessed with Andersen I walked into a vintage store and they had really good vintage hoodies which is why this happens even though it's summer and this will still these will come in handy at some point I'm literally running out of words to say about these clothing pieces waiting time you know I actually got a [ __ ] ton of white tops and I've been dreading trying them on I'm just gonna bang through them right now they're trying all that white tops I'm not even gonna [ __ ] talk about each one I'm just gonna try all of them on [Music] okay this one's actually pink but I thought I just throw it in there so you guys wouldn't get bored those were all the white tops I bought I have a few things left but I'm almost done I promise I'm almost done sorry these leggings are kind of fabulous I really like that these leggings are also fabulous I also got socks I also got fits it's very cool because it's like a flannel but it has a denim neck on it so that's it for the haul okay I'm done with the haul is that it did I show everything oh wait now I find this is the last thing I bought oh wait this is actually my merch if you're interested go to shop Emma Chamberland calm I have everything you think you could ever imagine on there everything on the shop ever Chamberlain comm is even better than what I bought today so today I'm gonna check that [ __ ] out okay so the problem is I cleaned out my closet I worked so hard doing that I spent hours cleaning out my closet just for me to go shopping one time I just farted [ __ ] I basically just refilled my entire closet with one shopping trip there's half of the pile there's like the other half of the pile I mean my closets probably full again but at least I had a good time and they save some new cool pieces aka just a bunch of basic [ __ ] that I'm going to wear everyday interchangeably which is actually probably even better than buying a bunch of like statement pieces cuz I would never wear it so that's it for today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did let me know what seems like the people that don't enjoy my videos let me know that so I'm not too worried about you guys letting me know I love you all thank you guys so much for watching and let me know down below if you guys have any good places to donate all the clothes that I'm not going to be wearing anymore because I'd love to do something and give back in anyway so if you guys know how I can do that or have any good places or resources let me know you guys are awesome and I'll see you guys next time [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-07-14T19:58:47Z,342624,8755503,16384,[Music] [Applause] holy [ __ ] I'm sweating I need attorneys yep [Music] what's up um happy Monday it's not gonna be a Monday when you're watching this but it's a Monday when I'm filming it so happy day getting straight the [ __ ] into it when I moved to LA one of the things that was most excited about was all of the cool coffee shops I was going to get to try the sad thing is is that I've literally been to probably five coffee shops out of the hundreds that are here I know that I like the coffee shops that I like okay so why the [ __ ] would I try a new one do you see what I'm saying it's 2:00 p.m. I have nothing to do and I was like you know what I'm gonna spend my entire day going to all of the coffee shops that I've always wanted to try out and I'm gonna try it all of them and I'm just gonna do this all day I'm just gonna go from one to the next to the next to the next the next and I'm just gonna try all of them out I don't know where we're going first actually so let me go and yell okay this one looks cute so the first place I'm going to is called coffee commissary it looks good I'm a [ __ ] now I don't really care actually I do care and the reason why I'm doing this is that I want to find some new coffee spots that I like because you know I have the few that I like and that's great but I want to try to find another faith I actually have not been looking at my Maps so I actually don't know if I'm going the right way let's see how it goes [Music] oh wait before I try this hold on okay so guys I have some big news I have new Air Force One there's nothing better than a clean and new Air Force One but gentleman I've been struggling finding our first ones recently because they are always sold out I'm not kidding always sold out every single time I try to buy them and so the only place I've been able to buy Air Force Ones is go goat is the most trusted sneaker marketplace that you can get shoes that you know are real because goat authenticates every pair of shoes that they sell on the app make sure that you don't get scammed and you get real good shoes that make your outfits look fire you know not to mention goat has amazing prices like I'm not kidding the prices are great if you want a new pair of Air Force Ones or you want any pair of shoes that literally exists there's a link in my description and you can go check out go okay I also almost forgot there's another great thing about go I know it's crazy everything about it's great you can pay with after pay on go after pay allows you to pay in installments rather than all at once when you check out on a website which is great for basically anyone so yeah check out goat use after pay do the damn thing get a new pair of shoes do what you got to do link is in the description go check it out freak yeah okay now let's try this huh you know what this place is good coffee commissary I'm gonna give it like a 7 out of 10 it tastes good I mean it's not the best coffee I've ever had like the espresso itself is not very robust that was fun now let's go to the next place the next place we're going to is called coffee dose it looks cute by the end of this video I'm going to be freaking out oh my god this caramels hit me oh I'm gonna have so much caffeine in my system I'm gonna try not to drink there's no way I'm gonna drink all the coffee I drink today like I'm not gonna finish every single one if I did that I would be damaged permanently I kind of deep down hope that like one of the coffee's I drink like sucks because I think that'd be kind of funny and entertaining I've had some shitty coffee in LA so it's definitely fathomable we'll see [Music] my is a sliding shitty hello first impression is that this is so cute look at this whole thing anti [ __ ] Irama alright okay let's try it oh it has a really good aftertaste but it's just so watery this is like a six out of ten oh my god some guys staring at me he thinks I'm psycho let me act like I'm facetiming yeah no I know yeah I've been to two coffee jobs that I've been filming for like an hour okay my goal is to get to ten coffee shops today I can do this next place we're going to is called Carrera I think I've gone pee in this place before but I've never actually had their coffee so not to mention I really have to pee because I have no ideas - I have to pee I'm also gonna look around like as I'm driving like if I see a cute coffee shop I'm just gonna go in you know what I mean because I have nothing to lose today oh my god I see one right there okay I can't stop in the middle of the road though sorry I love when there's parking and it's right by the infamous Melrose pink wall are you guys ready for this as you can see we're by the pink wall there's a bunch of tourists taking photos I don't know why the pink wall is such a big deal okay let's try coffee number three let's check it out come on guys let's come on I guess let's get going come on guys okay sorry I'll shut up three coffees in it may be time to make some movements okay because my body my body's confused he's in pain I can't tell if I have to poop or pee so let's get out thank you guys okay so okay this next cafe I went in there and I was like planning on just getting an iced latte per usual but then I saw that they do monogram lattes you see it it has a Louie Vuitton on it come on come on oh my god I need to take a snapshot of these two things together holy [ __ ] this is hilarious oh wait maybe it's Niall Aires might be an [ __ ] oh my god I have never been that shallow can you see that's as bad as it gets okay let's try coffee number three is it is it three I don't know oh no no okay note the coffee itself it tastes like soap a little bit and I also hate hot coffee anyway so this drink is not really my thing I am gonna give it a decent rating though because the fact that they do this cool monogram on the foam thing as you can see I don't know can you see can you see that zoom in on that you see that I'm gonna give them a 10 out of 10 for each degree mobility I'm gonna give them a four no I'm gonna give him a three out of ten per taste because that [ __ ] was not yummy at all let's see where we're going next oh my god this person's trying to back up into my car so next coffee place I've decided on it's called paramount coffee project literally I'm not kidding like I hate LA right now it's it's summer everyone is outside and everyone's driving around I'm just trying to film video I get it okay do you know I have not the only person that exists even though I'm not I do feel like I am and I do wish I was this is just coffee place number four it's really crazy to me how so many people just aren't really that picky about coffee like so many people will just drink shitty coffee and they're like okay with it there's actually like three coffee shops near paramount place I'm going to you right now so that's sick because I don't have to drive around I've literally to deal with four separate parking meters today we'll see you at the next place okay so I think I'm gonna pull some power moves and I'm gonna get my third fourth and fifth coffee in one scoop scoop scoop what [ __ ] it just says coffee so we're just gonna call this place coffee again we're going to get our fourth and fifth and then we're gonna try them in the car okay bye okay coffee number four and number five or is it number five and number six I need to take my beanie off but before I take it off fully let me remind you that this is for sale on shop atma Chamberlin dot-com it has a coffee splatter on it please buy it so I can buy more coffee okay but let me take that [ __ ] off because it's literally 70 degrees oh my god and my hair is like touching my neck I need it off my neck look at read my face is holy [ __ ] first let's try the coffee from paramount this was this is coffee number four see if it's any good this one tastes exactly the same as the first coffee I drank today like literally exactly the same like I don't think there's anything different no actually this might be my favorite so far so this one's really good paramount coffee okay I'm gonna give this one a seven and a half out of ten I don't eat it okay now let's try coffee number five this is from the coffee place that just had coffee on the outside they're literally all starting to just taste the same to me this one's like it's six and a half out of ten it's good I mean I'm kind of like running out of adjectives like it's good when I get it again like sure but like I wouldn't seek it out you know what I mean like I wouldn't like drive specifically to get this you know that's been the problem with all these places so far none of the coffee has been very unique so none of its been anything that I would go out of my way to get I've been filming this for like two hours and I've only gone to five places my goal was to go to ten but I'm so sorry but I don't want to go to ten maybe like seven yeah like maybe let's see like two more like coffee shops are gonna start closing coffee shops coffee shops are gonna start closing are you kidding me coffee shops are gonna start closing soon so I don't really have much time anyway but I'm having fun though this has been fun even though I haven't found anything really that that worthwhile I'm still having fun so keep that in mind I don't know where I'm going next actually let me figure that out why did I steam into my face there was no reason for that okay you know what do you think I'm gonna do to spice things up a little bit I'm just gonna drive around until I find a coffee place that looks good and then I'm gonna stop and then I'm gonna go in and then I'm gonna try it instead of going on Yelp and premeditating where I'm gonna go I'm gonna [ __ ] wing it and see what happens because that's part of life okay sometimes you wing it ways that a place ok wait maybe this is a danger hazard because I'm not [ __ ] looking at the road at all I'm literally just looking at at the stores [Laughter] wait literally why is there no coffee on the street what the [ __ ] I might need to go back on yells wait is that one oh my god I found one I found one I found one it's called Sunday morning it's today Sunday no it's Monday [ __ ] cause in sales like wow that's so fitting Coffee number six let's go drinking [Music] Coffee number six six this one DS the same as all the other ones it's not strong enough for me they don't have strong enough US president this one's like it's exam under tension none of these are willing me but none of them are really disappointing me and that's the problem with this video is that I'm under stimulated okay we're going to one more coffee shop we're going to one more one more I don't know what it's gonna be yet though okay I know where I'm going I know where I'm going it's a surprise get ready to be surprised in three two one sorry I got sales because you know what I wanted to drink something that would excite me and it would make me love my life again because you know the coffee today didn't really pack a punch for me so let's taste it ten out of ten all right this [ __ ] hit also look how big it is it's literally the size of my head today I learned that I'm just gonna stick to the coffee places I've been going to because apparently branching out didn't really work out for me so that's alright Cheers bye guys have an amazing week have a great day hope you had fun watching the video bye dude what's on my face oh that's just agony okay alright bye [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-07-08T19:58:14Z,432101,10416167,32496,[Music] [Music] it took me some time to want to get on here and tell you guys that I'm pregnant there is no dad it just that's didn't happen it was like an immaculate conception type of situation I woke up this morning and I had this if this has been really hard for me to tell you guys it's actually fake as you guys know I'm not [ __ ] pregnant I'm seven years old but you know one day I am going to be pregnant and I don't know when that day is gonna be probably in like ten years maybe more like you know like they doesn't come around I don't know I've been nervous my whole life to have children it's just very foreign to me and it seems really scary to me and it seems really uncomfortable to me and it like everything about pregnancy is terrified me since I was born I want to add baby fever because I'm 18 and I'm supposed to but I'm not so is that babies yet but I'm suppose that baby fever that's like what I'm supposed to have but I don't because I'm too scared of pregnancy so today I'm practicing being pregnant to prove to myself that it's not that scary so that you know so I'm just gonna be living my day as a pregnant woman so far it's been really easy because I look so [ __ ] cute pregnant sorry like I'm really sorry but like I did not think I was gonna be this cute while pregnant belly look so if you like the outfit looks cute like the leggings I mean these [ __ ] glasses are you kidding me wait hello I literally stepped outside of my apartment and immediately I was anxious and nervous so we're going to fill I always see people I know at film I know every I know all of the staff we'll see what happens [ __ ] no no I pre-ordered my coffee so that I wouldn't have to like wait in line and like I have four interactions comment down below who who the baby daddy would be also comment down below is it a girl or a boy I don't know we're close we're getting really close hello oh my god oh my god I literally can't do this big guy who I see every day here is in here the staff that I see every day oh my god I have something to tell you I'm pregnant that was quick right you remember the baby shower that just shook me up a little bit okay but that was fun those are all people I knew to like I know everybody who works there so like oh my god wait let me think you're allowed to drink caffeine when you're pregnant I don't care okay so we're gonna get some baby clothes and some groceries at Target let's go [Applause] being pregnant is making me drive so good as you can see we're on the we're on the line [ __ ] you didn't even do better no that's good enough I literally don't care I'm pregnant okay I'm pregnant we actually feel bad like I know that this is literally just silicone like this is a silicone ball but like I feel like a shitty person like you like because I feel like there's something in there even though there isn't this is kind of the test see how people react to me that don't know me at all like let's see if I get any stairs or anything while we're at Target I'm waiting to see if anyone asked me like how many weeks are you what am I going to say like every mom's favorite place to go Target okay so what am I getting pregnancy brain is making me a little Spacey I'm getting oh baby clothes and then I need to get pregnant mom snacks okay we're going to resent Sonya everyone says oh my god mini denim okay but that's like for like a four-year-old oh [ __ ] I love that No get a load of this get a [ __ ] load of this mini little fuzzy socks fold over this shit's cute I don't even I'm buying and then I'm gonna return it tomorrow when I'm done filming this video so waste my time this is for winter and then this is for spring this is for summer and then this is for fall and then this is for this is for when mommy's being hormonal oh my god have a pig underway is for when baby grows out of her diapers or his diapers holy [ __ ] look at this detail like with this little thing sitting out of the pocket yo yo you know I want my kid to grow up in the athletic so I'm gonna get this wrestling suit for them and it's American because I just like love America happy fourth of July so here's the thing like when you're pregnant like you're feeding not only yourself but you're also feeding your child because of that I need to be eating a lot so we're gonna get some snacks oh my god I'm totally I'm the judge and everyone just please straight up just with broccoli and cheese nuggets that's random baby hasn't popped up yet so I don't need to get cute little baby snacks yeah actually yeah I do [ __ ] you know I like want to go shopping for me like I'm seeing things that like I want to eat like not like once the video is over - I need to go back to Target later oh I should eat yoga right Nik women love yogurt oh my god I'm pregnant and that means I like pickles right oh my god Oh team just looked at me and that hurts the worst these are going on like what adults look at me I'm like whatever like they're like less judgmental but like teens teens will judge the [ __ ] out of me socially this is a challenge but at least it's look like a bad [ __ ] pregnant I mean come on look at this now we're gonna check out I understand why pregnant women cry a lot though also like I know it's hormones but also because like you know when you get like super overwhelmed and like you're like it's like you're like sweating and then you're like and there's something like your clothes are tight and you're trying to pick something up or something and then you just feel like really overwhelmed all at once you want to cry I don't know if that's a feeling anyone else feels I feel that feeling oh all the time okay let's go home and cook up a little some okay now we're home and we're gonna need some pregnant lady snacks I read online that pregnant women love strawberry yogurt with hot cheetos is that true I don't know wait it's kind of gross but like I can't stop a straight-up just chug this yogurt pregnancy craving number one strawberry yogurt with hot cheetos I actually approve weirdly enough I don't know next want pickles with peanut butter this one I'm worried about pickle and peanut butter down the hatch [ __ ] that oh that's just like not right in I like pickles though verdict eating as a pregnant woman is pretty fun so for today I did my morning coffee run I went to the store and I ate as a pregnant woman and I'm trying to think about what other things I normally do in a day you know maybe we should exercise I'm already wearing leggings sorry what if we just like what if we try I mean exercising as a pregnant woman there's no way it's easy okay let's do it that could be fun you know hi guys so right now I'm going to do a workout video a workout video for pregnant women so pregnant woman workout [ __ ] wait there's no way someone's here why like right now there's no it someone's at my door and I'm [ __ ] pregnant who the [ __ ] Oh somebody left me a package I'm sweating on my neck right now like that just gave me so much anxiety Jesus Christ now we are at the second set of exercises the next set of exercises is for women in their 4th to 6 month of pregnancy and involves stretching of body muscles how do these exercises benefit women at this stage of pregnancy and your body down to a 45 degree what is this this videos [ __ ] weird I'm just gonna do my own workout yes what a sit-up would be like Oh yep that's not good oh oh [ __ ] it's really unhealthy for the baby you could do like a plank do you want okay if you're pregnant you're working out enough on a daily basis carrying around this [ __ ] thing you do not need to work out [ __ ] that I'm not happy you know what this video sucks because I didn't go to SoulCycle with this thing I want to went to SoulCycle with this this would have been the ultimate video I [ __ ] up sorry is get comfortable in bed as a pregnant woman I feel like this would be hard especially considering that I in a stomach sleeper personally like I like to sleep on my stomach and it when you're pregnant you can't do that so let's see if I can get comfortable in my bed also if you're wondering why the pillows don't match my bed it's because I just got a new comforter and my old pillows don't match so nobody throws me on that in the comments I'm

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-07-02T19:06:52Z,302544,6430245,9970,[Applause] oh hi hey guys welcome back to my sewing channel if you guys are new I do sewing tutorials just kidding I dumped that was a lie but I am sewing today here's what's going on so today I'm gonna be sewing my clothes so I'm excited um I don't think it's gonna go very well Oh earlier I went to jo-ann fabrics and I bought some fabric and and it went fine oh my god I'm gonna be late but oh my god no I'm so [ __ ] stressed out I'm ready to go the fabric store only issue is that I have no gasps [ __ ] I'm so down but literally jo-ann fabrics closes in less than an hour oh okay whatever it's fine this is just my luck you know it's okay so I just saw a gas station and I was about to pull into it but if you want to pull into it you have to like kind of make an illegal turn and there's a [ __ ] cop right there should I just like drive to jo-ann fabrics and risk running out of gas in the middle of the street like what's the worst that could happen you know okay well you know what we'll figure this out later I'm gonna be the fabric store in two miles could run out of gas before that point like any minute now and you know what funny story I have ran out of gas in this car before I was on the freeway and IA ran out of gas and my car stopped on the freeway with everyone going 70 miles per hour and I had to slowly like inch my car over to the side of the road and it was [ __ ] terrible not to mention I was on my way to a meeting which made everything worse because I was late to the meeting so I'm kind of having PTSD from that oh my god huge okay so basically what I'm thinking is I want to do a plaid skirt I don't even know if they sell plaid at fabric stores but they probably do I mean like right like where else would they sell it and I want to do a tube top I feel like a tube top would be easy because it's just like a strip of fabric around your body so I don't know I mean I want to challenge myself a little bit don't get me wrong but like I don't want to challenge myself that much I used to gonna jo-ann fabrics with my mom all the time because she was huge into sewing and so I would go in there with her sometimes I would pick out a few pieces of fabric myself and then I go home and I would sew it and it was it wouldn't always turn out really bad at least it was a good hobby for me for maybe a few years I actually do know how to sew I think I went to sewing camp when I was very young I think I was like maybe in fifth grade I could always call my mom for help but then again is she gonna want to help me probably not also it's really dark out right now and that sucks because now the Lighting's bad and the angle of this camp of the cameras bad basically everything's going wrong but you know what things aren't really that bad because let me tell you about what happened to me earlier today I post made it a vegan meatball pizza and you'd think you that would be disgusting it was so [ __ ] good I'm seven minutes away oh my god I have a really sharp burp in my chest oh my god how do you guys feel about that let's do this [ __ ] it literally was running through jo-ann fabrics like a madman first thing I noticed was that I just spent $65 and I feel like I could buy a top and a skirt already pre-made for $65 like to feel like sewing is not good for me I'm sorry do you feel like I'm not really into it starting to feel like it's not good you know another issue is that I don't have a sewing machine so I'm gonna have to hand sew everything oh I also have no gasps I've literally no gasps no gasps so this is bad um I need to get gas and then I need to go home and then I need to start sewing you know I'm starting to realize that I think it really just like buying clothes like I love buying clubs but making clothes you know what I mean I don't know if I'm that into that first I got this fabric I'll actually really [ __ ] with this fabric a lot I think it's really cool I also got this simple white fabric for my tube top wait is this [ __ ] velvet [Music] No okay well that's [ __ ] disappointing I got some buttons I got fabric glue just in case the whole sewing thing goes badly and I just want to use fabric glue instead there's a 90% chance that I will be using this instead of actually sewing the clothes because I don't think it's gonna go well because I don't have a [ __ ] sewing machine I also got needle and thread everything you need got a bunch of different colors of thread I are really only needed white but shucks oh my god wait why am I excited okay I'm gonna start out with the tube top um how oh [ __ ] I don't have a [ __ ] ruler so how am I gonna know how what I saw holy [ __ ] someone who's screaming what am i doing what this is like the easiest [ __ ] partner can do it oh I have an idea okay so here's a tube top that fits me what if I like measure based off this so okay if I do like one and then okay easy step one um what's step one I don't want to so I don't want to I'm just gonna use that glue I'm giving up I want to do with that right now I really don't and I don't have to you can say [ __ ] [ __ ] oh man our eyes are leaking why delay the first step to success is learning about damage control so we're not gonna be selling much to weave fabric glue might actually be worse than actual selling it's so messy sorry I'm being really negative you know I feel like I'm negative a lot and I'm worried about it I don't know this [ __ ] talk to be too long or else I'm going to look [ __ ] stupid so the reason why I'm really bad at crafts is because I'm not very patient fabric gluing it's tough for me because I hate it okay you see I'm saying I mean I like doing crafts I like getting D up doing crafts you know that classic old quote talking about how you are how people a might okay usually people are just in love with the idea of somebody and not who someone actually is that is me but with crafts okay every time I burp it tastes like the pizza I ate earlier and the pizza was so good so I'm like not even mad about my burps tasting like pizza cuz like pizza was so it was so [ __ ] it was so good and like oh my god this is not gonna fit around me huh oh my god you're kidding me this doesn't fit around me [Music] okay I have an idea late-night craps [ __ ] that [ __ ] this [ __ ] all of this [ __ ] this ah there's gonna be permanent levels of fabric glue on my floor when I move out of this apartment I will not be getting back my security deposit I [ __ ] destroyed the place honestly my landlord if you're watching this I'm just kidding I really haven't destroyed the place I think my tube top is completed I mean I don't think I did that bad of a job but I also did do a bad job so at this point I'm basically recreating clothes I already have because there's no way I could come up with this [ __ ] in my brain we are going to be recreating this skirt and I love this skirt so why not I just [ __ ] Tracey right is that cheating I don't know hold on let me do it let me focus for a second leave me alone for a second sorry we're back not bad not bad oh you're kidding me look how cute this is wait wait [ __ ] okay hold on this is not bad at all I'm flipping my [ __ ] right now might like wear this skirt in public okay but I'm not done with it yet so let's not get too excited actually okay so I actually do have to sew something right now a little bit nervous this could go so good open it potentially really bad threading the needle is the hardest part I remember this from sewing camp when I was like seven come on come on come on yes now I just [ __ ] poked myself with a needle that was so irritating so this is gonna take me like nine years go eat what did I do something wrong no no what okay what I [ __ ] up I [ __ ] up the whole thing okay I [ __ ] up I made big boo-boo I'm sorry sorry I'm really focused right now but I'm like kind of emotionally invested into this skirt because I really [ __ ] wanted to work so just let me have this you're kidding me oh my god yes wait wait wait that's [ __ ] cute hello oh my god I'm so excited tube top was a fail because in her past I'm gonna let these clothing pieces dry a little bit and then we're gonna try them on okay oh wait I need my hold on there we go this is what happens when you film at night you'll need to use a ring right oh [ __ ] here it is not too bad honest okay well it's probably bad let's see oh no [ __ ] way oh my god holy [ __ ] it's perfectly oh my god okay there's no way I'm gonna be that lucky with this tube top though this tube top looks shitty okay though I am ready to see my outfit three two one you can literally see my nipples um so I'm gonna cover my nipples this skirt literally fits [ __ ] perfect I'm not kidding I would literally wear this skirt it's so cute it fits so good I'm actually like I'm actually I can't believe that I did I didn't show it I mentally fabric glue it and it looks so amazing but let's talk about the tube top oh yeah it's huge and the back looks really bad and it's falling off and now this skirt is [ __ ] amazing are you kidding me okay I need to cover up my nipples like I swear to God if I move my hands right now this table will fall off so I'm not gonna move my hands wait can I put on a different shirt with this real quick oh okay sorry this skirt is amazing this skirt is literally revolutionary I did not believe in myself I was being negative this whole time and this skirt [ __ ] slaves everyone hello [Music] I'm in awe that's it for today's video what I learned today is to believe in yourself and not to be so negative because things might turn out or right in the end and they did for me if you just look at this [ __ ] skirt now I can wear this I would not put it in the washing machine though because we'd probably break I feel like if I wore it in public like something with pearl it would probably rip somewhere but it would be cute in an Instagram photo so if you see this on Instagram you know what happened so that's it I hope you guys have an amazing day I hope you guys have an amazing week Pope you guys have an amazing year and I hope you guys have an amazing leg and I hope you guys follow your dreams and keep all that in mind so my skirt says goodbye to you ok guys peace peace of love [ __ ] ass yeah I'm so proud of myself damn [Music]

-emma chamberlain",2019-06-19T18:58:18Z,331814,8043831,16526,[Applause] oh I really don't know why I'm doing this Oh [Music] this is not gonna be [ __ ] fun you don't even know what we're doing okay this is probably the most extreme thing I've ever done why am I like nervous like I'm like sweating on my neck actually I might just be sweating because it's 80 degrees outside today I'm gonna be living on my balcony for 24 hours no I had this idea a while ago and I put it off because like why the [ __ ] would I want to do this but I like the idea because I think it would be fun the weather has been really good recently almost too good it's like hot out and so I thought it'd be perfect for me to get outdoors and live on my balcony for 24 hours I don't really know what I'm gonna do up here so this is probably gonna be like really boring for me I fully prepared myself for this experience I have snacks I have water I have a tent I have a sleeping bag I have a change of clothes I have a toothbrush I've everything I'm gonna need even sunscreen like I'm ready for this [ __ ] okay I guess the first order of business would be to set up my living space which would be my tent so oh my god I have a rash in my armpit and it's it's pretty uncomfortable I'm not gonna lie ah to be completely honest I have no idea what it is in it probably is ringworm so let's do this oh my god I have no idea I have no idea what I'm doing should I be reading the directions oh my god this is so complicated holy [ __ ] [Music] [ __ ] it [Applause] that was so [ __ ] irritating there's no way I can figure out how to set that up the directions made no sense I don't have [ __ ] throwing that [ __ ] in the trash that is the worst tent that I've ever seen [ __ ] that tent I hate that tent and it's so hot out that I can't lie away are you having a mental breakdown uh this is like off to a rough start why are there so many sirens whatever oh my god literally there's like a whole [ __ ] crime scene going on I guess that's what living in LA is like I'm actually like really upset that I'm out here right now sorry I'm not I'm gonna try not to be negative this is great I love this let me try to turn this thing around okay because right now I'm having a shitty time I think I'm gonna get a tan I brought out a towel and a bathing suit knowing that it would be hot out today and knowing that I could pass some time by tanning out on my balcony because do you know why I do that anyways so might as well do it right now because why not oh my god you know what sucks though after I'm done tanning I can't go shower off my sweat that I formed while tanning so that's how it's hot oh I kind of like surrendered to the fact that like I'm just gonna be in pain and I'm not gonna be able to do anything for the next probably six hours until the Sun Goes Down so I'm probably gonna tan for at least an hour of that I can't do anything because I'm so uncomfortable it's so hot out guys I'm not even kidding I might forfeit this challenge forfeit is that the right word is it even worth it I just want to go back inside I'm really gonna try to stay out here because I want to like prove to myself that I can you know I will not give up I can't want to cry a little bit like I'm really having a hard time I've literally been outside for less than an hour and I already want to I'm already like almost crying I think I'm just really sensitive oh my god what did I just do I fell asleep in the Sun for a little bit I woke up for a second and I was like hey I can't be doing this because I'm gonna burn my skin really bad so then I moved my towel into the shade and then slept for another hour and a half so the problem is that whenever I take naps I can't fall asleep at night so now I'm gonna be awake all night but with the flip hello on the roof [ __ ] awful no like literally like almost cried like once I don't even think I got a good tan out of tan I mean yeah I don't think I got much color cuz I think I kind of gave up I slept in the Sun for like two seconds and then moved into the shades so now that I took a nap though kind of in better spirits also the temperatures going down it's around 70 something now but I think I need to change out of my bathing suit because I'm actually getting a little cold and maybe we can eat a snack because I'm getting a little hungry so let me assess some things and I'll be back okay let's see what kind of snacks I brought out here I kind of just threw random things from my pantry in here chickpea puffs I went to Whole Foods okay cranberry and almond delight Trail Mix that I bought one time in the airport and then didn't ever eat it so then I brought it home I have some almond butter packets and then have some of these are x-bar things this honestly sounds the most appealing to me right now so I think I'm just gonna eat it I really want like a full meal right now but the problem is like I didn't really plan ahead food wise [Music] there's my tent I'm not sleeping in a tent tonight what could I do up here there's kind of nothing to do cheers okay now that it's not as hot out I'm doing better in the beginning I thought I was gonna have to throw in the towel and not do this challenge at all because I was like there's just no way but now that it's not as hot I feel like this is something that I can do I feel like this is pretty doable I am a little bit nervous about sleeping without a tent because I'm kind of worrying about bugs I also worry about if it's gonna start raining the weather report says it won't but what if it does while I'm sleeping and I wake up and get all my things wet I'm gonna try to go to bed early tonight so that I can get this over with I don't know if it's possible but if I try hard enough anything is possible right [Applause] I actually brought out one activity that I could do when I was out here because I knew I was gonna get bored sorry maybe I could bring those things out now okay so I brought out some art supplies because there's literally not one thing to do on this balcony it's like 50 feet by 50 feet or something or like 50 feet by like 30 feet or something I don't know math maybe that's like 20 feet maybe like 20 feet by like 35 feet I don't know no one ever told me when I moved in but this could be kind of fun this could pass a few hours okay so the first thing I'm gonna be drawing is a self-portrait I think it would be fun and it's probably not gonna be very good so let's scare it into it off to a bad start oh god this is terrible my lips are not that big ever so oh god I'm doing bad I'm actually really trying right now I know I don't have a bun in my hair right now but this is what I normally look like what do you guys think did I do good okay I didn't think I did good either I'm glad we're on the same page next let's draw this shoot we'll see how it goes oh no that's actually too hard I really don't want to draw that I'm gonna draw a pig next so stay tuned you above just [ __ ] landed on my paper [ __ ] that okay I don't think I did a very good job on this pig sorry about that one let's do one more drawing I'm actually getting really [ __ ] bored and it's only been like five minutes but I just don't want to do this anymore I'm gonna draw an alien so scare it into it okay so here's my alien I just drew this might be my best one yet it's also my last one because I don't like drawing that much and I don't really know why I started to do this it was a cute idea in theory oh my god it's flying away in reality I didn't have that much fun and I think I'm just gonna lay down and go on my phone for the next few hours because to be completely honest I just want to go to bed I'm out of activities straight up it's not my fault that I didn't plan this out properly I mean what did we expect you know how I just stepped on something I think I got a splinter this is what happens when I go outside did I not bring out a blanket oh my god I did it [ __ ] okay well I'm probably gonna be doing this for the next few hours so I'll put you out of your misery and I'll see you maybe when it gets dark [Music] look at what the sky looks like right now I'm starting to get scared literally just fog oh my god okay [Music] why are there so many helicopters I'm gonna open up my suitcase I mean my I'm gonna open up my sleeping bag and get in it I didn't bring out a jacket with me when I came out here so this is what we have to do it's 8 p.m. I've been out here for seven hours I really haven't been doing much I mean I'm just kind of like doing what I would do if I was inside except outside which basically means just going on my phone for hours on end oh this suitcase I mean that is not a [ __ ] suitcase wow this is really nice actually well now I feel nice and cozy where's my phone that's important I feel a lot better now that I'm warm this material I'm a really big sucker for blankets like this just completely lifted my mood I'm not gonna lie to you this video has been really tough for me to film because I'm not normally outside very often I am a little bit worried because I feel like it might start raining not to mention I have not gone to the bathroom one time since I've started this I don't know if that's good or bad I bring chapstick out here please God tell me that's oh my god I didn't bring chapstick out here no is that real I thought I did oh my god I'm gonna lose my marbles oh my god I did bring it yes [Applause] maybe I'll just get ready for bed right now okay I don't know how I'm gonna do this ooh ooh okay that was pretty successful though this is about the time of day where I wish I had my suitcase wait why do I keep saying Sookie I wish I had my tent but okay now I'm gonna put on my face stuff I don't have a mirror so I'm just gonna wing it nighttime routine oh my god there's a [ __ ] bug oh no this is gonna be if there's gonna be a bug issue ready for bed now that didn't take very long but it's still literally light out I mean the sun's going down and the moon is out I'm just gonna chill for the next like hour - until it's time to go to bed so let's see how comfortable I can get out here whoops actually isn't so bad Wow it's got a nice why is this making me want to go camping it's actually really relaxing laying out here the sleeping bag makes his experience very easy so kind of having the best time in my life okay my phone's at 23% I'm gonna run this thing till it dies when it dies I'll go to sleep I'm just gonna layer and enjoy my phone and enjoy the ambience of the outdoors guys trying to set a home but maybe use a tent instead just an idea it's getting later it's almost 10:00 p.m. I've now been out here for what like nine hours I'm starting to like lose count I'm actually getting really tired right before I turn on the camera and the reason why I turned on the camera was because I was just kind of laying here and shutting my eyes because my phone was on its last five percent and I was like I don't wanna waste this and I just closed my eyes and I started to get really really relaxed it's actually really nice laying out here I'm really comfortable I am a little bit concerned about bugs but I mean like I feel pretty good like this is weirdly the easiest part I thought actually sleeping out here would be like a challenge but in reality this really isn't that bad I am a little bit hungry though but I'll just eat a really big feast tomorrow I might try to go to sleep it's only like 10:00 I'm really sleep-deprived so I feel like I could go to sleep now it's really nice out here I can't see any stars because I'm in LA where the smog covers all the stars so I just looking up at fog which is kind of like sad but it's still really like serene I'm here pretty quiet there hasn't been a helicopter in a few minutes I wouldn't do this again you know but you know actually sleeping I here with my friends during the summer could be a vibe we're never gonna do it but it's a really fun thought I don't know if I'm gonna have a good night's sleep I'm also worried it's gonna rain still because it's a little bit moist feeling out here like I feel like it's a little bit moist I feel some moisture in the air so I am a little bit concerned but at this point [ __ ] it okay well I'm gonna try to go to sleep honestly hopefully the next time I see you it's the morning sweet dreams I have no [ __ ] idea what time it is it's so dark it's a little bit damp out here my back [ __ ] hurts I want to go as I was sleeping for a while and then I will go and now I'm awake it's not that cold so that's good I think I can make it until the morning I'm just having like back pain because I'm laying straight up on the cement that's uncomfortable for anyone also my lips are really chapped but I don't really want to get my chapstick I wish I knew what time it was I should have brought out a [ __ ] watch or something but this sleeping bag is [ __ ] really working I don't even feel like I'm outside because the sleeping bag just insulates all my body heat and then I used to like a little baby in a cocoon also I'm sorry that was dark but I don't want my flashlight because my phone is dead I have no idea what time it is and I know I need to just go to sleep so that I can just wake up and [ __ ] in this video so huh I love you guys wait why did I say I'm literally delirious okay okay goodnight I guess I hopefully I'll see you in the morning if I survive oh my god I have to fart mmm did you guys hear that I really hope you heard that you oh my god I'm traumatized by that I wish I had a bed out here now that would be amazing if I had a bed out here we're like a really long couch because I just have like a short couch I would [ __ ] sleep out here all the time okay I'm gonna go to bed wish me luck I guess [Music] I did it it really wasn't that hard it just wasn't that hard my body hurts a little bit it's not that I'm not that [ __ ] prime D pretty good right now [ __ ] I'm just gonna go inside I think I've earned it I'm excited oh my god why did I do this oh yeah Oh why does my skin look so awful I thought he didn't have acne anymore okay guys I'm probably gonna actually take another nap I've just been sleeping for the past 24 hours because this bed just feels too good I miss being inside I hope you enjoyed try this at home for a fun summer activity if you live somewhere where there's mosquitoes enjoy your mosquito bites if you try this out and yes that's about it okay I love you guys have a good day and yeah okay [Music]

-emma chamberlain",2019-06-11T20:53:27Z,461651,12617016,17673,[Music] [Applause] [Music] road trip [Music] you guys didn't know I recently turned 18 I mention it in every video for me it's a big deal because everybody was always like and was the baby ooh baby Emma she is so young in 17 and now I'm 18 and so I'm just like really riding this wave of finally being an adult and finally being respected by my peers and acquaintances oh my god I'm gonna hit my garage I do this every day I literally tent my car on my garage and once a day oh my god this is a big moment [ __ ] oh my god that was one of my best performances I've ever done so basically I turned 18 and now I have a lot more privileges there's a lot more things I'm allowed to do that I wasn't allowed to do before one of them being traveled by myself my main issue was always that I could never book a hotel by myself now I don't really know why I'd want to book hotel by myself but now that I'm 18 and I can but go hotel by myself I thought it'd be fun if I went on a trip by myself recently I've been kind of craving like a trip a relaxing nice relaxing trip okay but I feel like I'm gonna be bored at first I thought oh my god going on a trip by myself that's gonna be so relaxing and nice but now I'm like thinking about it more and I'm like you know what it kind of might be shitty because I'm gonna be so [ __ ] bored I was thinking of the things I normally do when I'm on vacation with my friends and I was like okay so we go to the pool we go shopping we get food the order room service and out of all those things the only thing that sounds like it'd be fun to do by yourself is getting room service this might be really terrible this might actually be a really terrible time but it also might be really fun I mean I'm going to Laguna oh I didn't even say that I'm going to look go to Beach California it's a two-hour drive away from me it's not that far away from me I did that because I didn't want to go anywhere too far away just in case hit a mental breakdown it's called damage control I'm just making sure no I actually really could have gone somewhere cooler but here's the thing I just found out two days ago that every friend I have in LA is going on a trip at the same time leaving me home in LA by myself and when I found out this news I was like no this is not [ __ ] happening so who's honking at me I can't do anything here's another issue there's issues there's lots of them why did I forget what the issue is I forgot what the issue is I started talking about it and then I forgot I had a rough morning last night I booked the hotel to come to Laguna super exciting my plan was that I was gonna wake up this morning and go to SoulCycle at 10:45 and then I was going to go to Laguna after as I was like oh wow that didn't happen because I woke up at noon I was slept through my alarm and I was so [ __ ] upset about that I hate when I sleep through things it's the worst feeling it's like you sleep through something and you look at your brother you're like ah it sucks so bad but at the same time what can you do I'll be there probably by 2:45 we're gonna get a coffee we're gonna [ __ ] swim in the pool maybe although that sounds really socially awkward for me I feel like I'd be really uncomfortable about that going to a pool by myself with other people around all of them are with their friends and I'm just by myself floating in the pool that sounds like a nightmare but maybe I'll do it order room service maybe y'all get some snacks we're gonna have a good time a good little day trip I'm only gonna be here for one day because I'm [ __ ] to do okay another activity I was thinking about doing was to get a massage slash facial so tell them saying it has a really amazing spa and when I found this out I was like okay I need to act on this last night I called them and I was on hold for two hours okay no it was only like 30 minutes but still it felt like two hours so I'm gonna call them again today and see if they answer and see if I can book something if not then maybe I'll try to book it when I get there and if that doesn't work then I'm just gonna [ __ ] freak out I swear to God if they don't answer well I wanted to see if there was any like massage or facial like today like around maybe like four or five I'm at two o'clock or it looks like massage the latest time we could do would be 230 I don't know if you would like to do and do 30 Misbah swings okay um I'll do a facial at 4:45 that sounds great or prevent perfect you go ahead and secure this for you great thank you so much bye yeah ah I'm so excited that's amazing I need to raise this out on my calendar girls I forget was that about me tell me something it might be like you're going to Laguna why are you not gonna go to the beach and my question would be how did you know I wasn't gonna go to the beach because I haven't said that yet and then my response would I just missed my left turn [ __ ] the problem is that it's not that hot out it's literally like sixty degrees out so like why would I go to the beach you know anyway this is a 20-minute clip so I'm just gonna see you guys when I feel like it I'm like 13 minutes away and look at this fog it's pretty [ __ ] funny so so much for going to the beach even though I wasn't gonna really do that anyways bye I have arrived first order of business I need coffee even though I haven't even finished my first one I don't think I care and I think I'm going to get another one and then we're gonna go get food because I need to feed my body so that I'm ready to get a facial is that how that works I also feel like I get facials like quite frequently in my videos like I got a facial and like my preparing for Coachella video like why do I keep getting facials and why do I film it every time but okay look at the weather outside so I come to Laguna Beach you know Laguna Beach you know so sunny and stuff ya know do you know I really don't care I'm trying to just be positive here my shoes here's my fingers all my acrylics fell off I don't want to talk about it let me copy now [Music] [Applause] [Music] pretty good oh my god this is kind of off to a rough start so I just ate and got coffee by myself listen listen I'm uncomfortable because I'm by myself and so like I'm having to like do things by myself and that's cool but did I just get all that I didn't move my car eating in that restaurant by myself made me beyond uncomfortable I felt so weird everyone else was like with their friends I was like sitting by myself at this table I feel like everybody felt bad for me and thought I was like lonely and sad I mean and I I'm not I mean maybe a little bit but like not sad just a little lonely I am a little bit lonely I'm not gonna lie but I'm still enjoying myself like I'm not having a shitty time because I'm by myself you know I'm self-sufficient I can handle my damn self if I feel uncomfortable going to eat at a restaurant by myself I don't even know what's gonna happen when I want to go down to the pool later and swim like that's just not even gonna happen I'm going to my hotel right now to check in and then I'm gonna get a facial getting a facial is gonna be so easy I'm just gonna lay there for an hour while they [ __ ] massage my face and put like creams on it so like that'll be easy that won't be awkward you know this isn't so bad I'm here so I thought it would be fun if we did a room tour so why don't we do a little room tour shall we so here as you can see is the front door and as you turn to the right you have the bathroom with a very very nice bathtub where's the shower what the [ __ ] is there even a shower in this place what oh okay and if you look on the right side of the bathroom you have the shower the very nice toilet as well as a very nice double sink vanity which I only need one sink because I'm [ __ ] by myself anyways we have some nice products I will be stealing all of those and there's a button what does this do Oh what the [ __ ] that's nice as you can see on my sweatshirt I have a bear ass I only know I bought this sweatshirt and knows videos probably get to monetize we have the coffee machine and we have some things that I cannot touch because I am still very young walking into this area we have the nice king bed that I will be having all to myself and we have mice things that are my stuff that I brought we have a desk for when I'm gonna be working non-stop while I'm here just kidding I will be working on nothing and last but not least we have my deck which I will be

facial was actually really nice though I enjoyed it very much my skin feels very moist in supple she also popped a lot of my blackheads which hurt really bad and I was like trying to relax and then she just starts like [ __ ] tearing my face apart with her fingers and I was like boom but it was much needed because I had a lot of blackheads so I'm not gonna be mad at her and I'm like really born it's like 7:00 p.m. I'm so lonely I've literally just been on the phone and I'm on for the past hour just talking here about how [ __ ] lonely I am look I need to be doing something fun or I mean I guess I could go down to the concierge desk and just start making friends with the concierge because I'm just [ __ ] lonely what if I just walk down there and be like hey guys now like oh what can we help you with and I'm like no I just want chill no I'm just trying chill you guys I don't know I don't need any I'm stirring show of y'all because I'm chill should I look up the things to do in Laguna Beach California on Google honestly at this point I don't have anything better to do whale-watching not gonna do that wine tasting can't do that whale and dolphin cruise don't have time to plan that each is too cold for that hiking too cold for that museums and galleries no art festivals no chopping okay maybe but like it's already 7 o'clock I doubt any stores are open right now I'll update you once they [ __ ] figure out what to do with myself because for now or just [ __ ] laying in bed and that's what it's gonna be but at least my skin looks kind of glowy thank you to the facialist yeah but I can't film that because I don't get copyrighted so you're telling me I should make a paper airplane out of the [ __ ] menu around the carpet god I think I'm gonna go to the [ __ ] the hot tub I've just been doing nothing for the past hour and I'm starting to feel like a [ __ ] loser I'm in Laguna Beach by myself I need to enjoy this experience why don't we go to the [ __ ] hot tub okay that seems like a fun activity as of now no one's at the hot tub so I think I have a few minutes of alone time in the hot tub before people start showing up let's just go to the [ __ ] hot tub it's right down there as you can see it is right there I really don't even want to be doing this but for some reason I feel like I should because I feel like if I don't then I'm gonna regret it and so oh wait that is not the hot tub that is the kiddie pool so I found the hot tub but there's an event going on behind me [Music] so it's like do I get into this hot tub in front of these people right now I guess I'll do it [Music] this is so sad [Music] you know I'm gonna get out just a side of hummus and pita you guys do that and then can I do the chickpea chili and then I also have a question about your guys's smoothies or any of them vegan [Music] banana peanut butter smoothie with almond milk if that's possible that is it thank you so much I'm dehydrated so let's get some water I'm vlogging every single move that I make at this point because I feel like this videos gonna be boring because haven't done anything and the reason why I haven't done anything is because I'm [ __ ] lonely do I also need ice I want to get ice okay let's do that it's up here oh oh you're kidding look what I just found I found the [ __ ] snacks let's see if any of this looks good [ __ ] this is Trail Mix Trail Mix okay gummy bears I hate gummy bears unpopular opinion jumbo cashews now okay none of the snacks are really like hating the spot for me so we'll just wait for the room-service it's probably better that way anyways let's go see if we can find the ice this is a project that we need to take on together as a family I also have a phobia of leaving my hotel room so the fact that I have to leave my hotel room right now to get ice is like extremely nauseating okay we're gonna go this way starting to get scared [Music] now where the [ __ ] is it why is this so difficult like it can't be that hard to find I'm going to another floor to try to find it oh my god yes thank [ __ ] dog you guys don't even know what I just went through to get this ice Oh [Music] some [ __ ] let's try the hummus I'm a hummus connoisseur I do love me some hummus so let's see if it's any good mmm only complaint is that the pita isn't toasted I hate when they do that but whatever the peanut butter banana smoothie this is [ __ ] up I love that okay now let's try it soup um oh sure this is good Wow I'm not even fun this is the best part of the day I'm really not that hungry I don't know why I ordered so much food if anyone watching this doesn't like hummus what's wrong okay now I'm four I ate too fast we solve this though I dream that you've asked it's only 9:20 but I think we're gonna bang goodnight okay [Music] good morning well that concludes my trip by myself I think you guys already know how I feel um lonely would I do it again maybe no as much as I like to complain because that's just my personality I really did have a really nice and relaxing time and my facial really came in clutch I mean look I only have a [ __ ] baby face right now I'm gonna go home I have a doctor's appointment today nothing fun going on just gonna [ __ ] do that I need to rally up the troops more often the troops being my friends and have us all go on some trips some more because they think it's really good and fun for us as young people to be doing things like that and expanding our knowledge on other locations then exists I'm gonna wrap this up so I don't [ __ ] bore you guys for another second I love you guys hey we have an amazing day go treat yourself today maybe go get a coffee for yourself or maybe just don't [ __ ] do anything alright he's out ah [Music]

thing what does he ever come up with an idea that we've used before I'm not gonna lose Erica what are we live in common we all draw that in high school years no we actually all graduated I left physical beginning of junior year so I have a little bit more high school experience in high school than they do million high school for months that's it and then after that we did tangibly your high school we did it on something you only touch going to tangible high school yeah tangible going exploded you can touch obviously as you walk how you can feel the walls other classmates now people think that we're dropouts because we don't go to school when everybody else is going to school that's arranged so when I went to like actual physical I guess I had to buff up dude is a really important city you learning objective I salute you had something to say I'm really saying something important i when I went to school like it's tangible school I was very serious about I took it very seriously honestly for a little bit becomes a straight A's you know shut the [ __ ] up it was that scuffle taught me work ethic this homework once in my life over did it teach you like oh I have social skills in that time people often talking now that's not bad so my classrooms on the third floor I threw my friends bag bag out the window the teacher said this is nothing to diminish you walk that you will be dozing the consequences tomorrow in that [ __ ] picture you can insert in the video to stuff me thing believe me alright sure if we were all in school right now we would all be taking finals but we don't go to school anymore so we thought it'd be fun if we took finals again for those of you that are going through finals I just want to say it may be very stressful today if it feels like you're being weighed down bowels just waited oh wait I don't think you're being weighed down who's being weighed down oh all right oh wait I don't think I just want to tell you you're gonna get through you can do it you're gonna do just fine if you make it through this time doing finals you put all the hard work you can do do all the stress you'll know later I like when you you know fix a stressful situation that you can get through it because you got the class and that's so basically what we're doing so we're gonna have a full mini simulation of finals we're starting out with study session math science English history almost like what I remember from one of these to take vitals I would just drink coffee and study all night so we're do that and then we have our test and then I've got coffee for education correct I heard I'm bullying you [ __ ] go back yeah so I had a few Chinese say this I had a fear of going to the bathroom in school and I'm gonna say it for only people who don't say at school I would go to the bathroom and I would look study was the bathroom and I always like squeezed it that last side of study squeeze out that last I did not begin creative yeah I've had just shitty years every year that's a good thing to look forward to you know I look forward to my thirties my daughter or son preferably Thunder why do you [ __ ] like Amazon that Dad bro it's just the cutest [ __ ] I have ever and if you want to be my daughter Ward suck and then I wanted to take you them in a wagon to the beach on 4th of July and they're wary of red Sun really peaked in eighth grade step one we have to know you want it what's going on I should be making four lattes oh my god that sucks you don't I actually do like that really what are you yeah okay so now [Music] cause really nice it's really nice that's great no it's really good it's not only good angle I don't [ __ ] care no but he's our son has to get studying never coffee cheers to finals are we studying yes right now you know so to study for English we used vocabulary flashcards to freshen up on our vocabulary skills and there prepare for the vocabulary tests that we would be taking not only that but studying vocabulary helps your essay writing which will also be a part of the English test that we will be taking for our first subject that we're studying for was studying for English burning this test we're doing a vocabulary section and we're doing an essay writing section now there's obviously no way we can study them as they writing something you just have to be smart that day so section says but we do have both have flashcards that my friend Amanda made Humana why'd you do that for me I'll go first adversary's Dylan says adversary yeah indifferent difficult and opponent enemy okay was it wrong no you don't you just wanna have fun but you can't cuz you have to be doing final with your friends I'm also freezing but they ever want the most flavor that's so true if I was we exist summer would it be as flawed get that the pain to have to the different games so next word do support I know it I know this gourd means to like to [ __ ] something off it doesn't become blood something does it I think the court out this core makes it box a little it's actually disagreement is this prodigal or prodigal rhodesia protocol there's no [ __ ] way that's pro deagle I think if you're like really good at talking as we see them as someone who is is so I think it's like an excellent performance kind of but he's almost a flawless person extravagant wasteful Amanda do you write some [ __ ] down wrong then does not feel right to me John this company's woodworking lazuli yeah alright guys come on please get this advocate faculty no advocate I don't know sipping our advocated slight push to get what you want advocate used to stand up for something are you joking that occasionally is like the influence it's like you read it it's like it's like it's like you don't even like do this to someone to do it oh really [ __ ] favor of support so my dad stand up support no for something so really nice thing nice Mandela quickly up is it knowledgeable is it'd be like no it's really deep it's like really profound is really deeply to the on top breakdown of prefixing the suffix pro fat pro means good at down means to find deep insightful I think we're good let's take a test down whatever what is problem problem problem so firstly place into you to like just be like a green so basically need yeah high resolution obviously [ __ ] doing drizzle your final starts in 30 seconds and if you don't give me your cards you get it automatically this is like I know Sonny with your friends and coffee and it'll be fun that's so true this is actually fun because I had no friends to study with boy who's my brother who you can see we argue a lot you should to study for math we're gonna be brushing up on our multiplication tables so we're gonna do a timed mini quiz that looks a little something like this you probably remember it from third grade to see how much multiplication we remember off the top of our head and this will prepare us for a much more complex math test I thought that it would be cool if we just kind of like brushed up on the multiplication skills no grades in my class and I was very upset he's like [ __ ] sneeze they were self-weight it was a one-minute quiz and I sneeze dirty yeah I just learned that thank you guys stop okay yeah a little anxious when I see other people testing next me so gonna get look at the wider know this mmm okay we get like you know I'd if you're really sensitive oh how about oh we're doing a practice test I honestly think is most ways to study me gives it again which i think is the best way to study I mean one minute deep breath that's all what did he go [ __ ] what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] oh my god I did not finish that I do great that class and I definitely had a lot of wrong out of 60 I ain't for me 22 I ran for the same problem like a couple times at it but a different answer for each side because it wasn't sure if that's the right in sometimes you get it I got 39 I had 27 to the [ __ ] ones that I was getting caught up on I did it no the ones that go above 5 you didn't answer that's not true I did a lot of nines ok I didn't keep I can keep going I forgot 9 times e but it's easily 56,000 these 70 something it's 71 or 72 Jimmy I would have been friends if we went to school together I don't think so I think no I think you would avoid me what you guys want to pick up to study for history we're going to be analyzing the US map because for our history tests we're gonna be taking a timed test to see if we remember where all the states are on the map I couldn't think of a better way to study for history so we're just gonna be staring at the map for the next like two minutes let's just like talk about it let's talk about things that we need to remember alright so if you look for Minnesota to Iowa to Missouri Arkansas Louisiana it's a shitty [ __ ] do you want to I remember Florida cuz it's like Flo Rida and he was the rapper because it's huge at the bottom of the East Coast and it sticks out into the ocean for Vermont if you look up here they're looking at me that's a little trick I remember Texas because its biggest fault I didn't know New Mexico until just now I you talk looks like a foam finger Oh have I even learned anything from this serie this no okay well I'm gonna [ __ ] fail this test I think the race is gonna do really well on the stairs I think we're I'm assessed look at for yourself I didn't even know Marilyn existed there's like a lot of states that I just like forgot existed for example like I definitely forgot about North Dakota L to go to what is that all right but you don't even memorizing yes you're studying time is over sorry no you drink too much coffee he's gonna go make poopy so for our science test we're doing a group laugh a very simple one for kids where you mix baking soda vinegar and water in a water bottle and put a balloon on the top of the water bottle and see if the balloon inflates we're gonna have to memorize the lab procedures and see if we can do the lab as a group without the instructions in front of us so in order to study we're gonna be analyzing the lab procedures and hopefully remember them we're really final tired we're [ __ ] tired this is this is becoming a real seal and we still have one more test to study for wait [ __ ] get out of here wait ready Thomas over the top end really fast no you don't get it I've never seen anything like that listen listen we have science which is awesome I love science this is my worst subject in high school bio was the last science class I did and that [ __ ] made no sense than the other okay well we're not doing that we're doing chemistry okay so this is what we need to study basically the test for science is that we have a group lab we're doing a group lab which means that we're all gonna work together on a lab in a group grade but there's a twist it would be too easy if we could just follow the instructions for the final test for the test when we do the lab we have to have the procedures memorized that exempts follows we have all directions no we can't vote erections you have to have but memorize our head as a group there's six steps here in this three of us that means we should each remember to stick I just did Matt I'm doing the last two I'm gonna call what steps are you doing no come on I don't [ __ ] took I don't trust you anymore I'm doing the last two steps I'm doing first two steps all right I think the second tier then one of my steps is just watches your blue blows up that's it well that step doesn't happen then that's on you it's also when you [ __ ] you're starting it all right let's done I'm done raising okay okay [Music] we've studied for all of our classes are you guys feeling it's look like dark out now we started to feel me when it was light out it's not dark out for these people studying for so long anymore he's already a gym well also because Emma doesn't have a battery for your cameras we wait for the charge late hour [Music] I do an entire it's like I'm really hungry I feel kind of funny we're gonna need to do the beds me I think you're gonna do good at the history and I'm not gonna do good at that but everything else I'm any good at so I think I'm gonna win history I think Emma I'll give it to her she's probably gonna win mathematics you think no wouldn't [ __ ] and I'm running English I gotta win something else I'm just good for nothing really for me it's like more funny really for the English test we have an essay writing section where we have two prompts that we have to write about and we also have a vocabulary section or we have to see if we can match the definitions of the vocabulary words to the vocabulary words we have two prompts all right so first prompt a group of legislators in your state have proposed a new law that would require all children under the age of 12 to wear helmets while cycling has someone with siblings or neighbors of that egg write an editorial for your local newspaper encouraging other legislators to support or oppose the law second prompt it is often said that experience is a great tool the purse was persuasive the second one is expository yeah expository you're like exposing your emotions your robbed when you like kind of like it's a gasser type of pill you take when you have to go to face the second prong it is often said the experience is a great teacher but experience isn't the only way to learn write a brief essay to a person younger than yourself comparing and contrasting learning Mike's games to learning by studying a subject you excrete read a little bit yeah I is because I feel like the mag drums nothing picking up I was like yeah that's nice begin in your head please [ __ ] peek at my [ __ ] you know [Music] Handa before us yeah we cut the camera because we're taking too long I looked over it even and I just saw two lines I was like dot I started automata peels crash clunk and then stop crash clunk black you know we out we are we're all that was the horrifying unsavory sound hurt on plane think Wall Street yesterday afternoon after Jerry fully and nine-year-old child from rib city was rushed to the hospital after flipping over the handlebars of his Schwinn mountain bike and rushed to the local hospital paramedics say young Jerry wasn't wearing a helmet his brains may have stuck to the sidewalk like chewed pieces of gum we already have an uncontainable issue with gum litter in the cities is pretty interesting it's definitely persuasive for the legislators let's prevent it from going further 12 year olds are too young to know how to ride a bicycle properly or they have not had enough time to hone their two wheeler skills past helmet enforcement laws for 12 year olds to keep the city clean mine is so not as funny as that and I'm [ __ ] pissed why was it funny once mine was persuasion okay what you look stupid without grow up you'd rather get a king touching than looks this stuff I only like the first two lines there is no reason not in all caps I know you can do that to be safe try to argue it you can't you can't what look you look stupid with that helmet on girl what you'd rather get a concussion then look stupid on your stupid bike put your ego in the dumpster you are an [ __ ] okay this is is this a script I know this is appropriate you are an [ __ ] if you don't wear a helmet or you don't put one on she's calling told me all these now that I'm an 18 year old you can't be doing that and you should go to jail I [ __ ] hate you and also helmets can look sick if you have the right one obviously I recommend the ones from Target okay way better than that I like getting [ __ ] done quick knowing the teachers not actually gonna read it so like [ __ ] your legislators I need your help are you a tree it's kind of a call to action all right did you know the leading cause of injury to those aged 12 and under is due to cycling accidents this is a statistic you've made us nobody looking false bro helmets are statistically proven to prevent traumatic head injuries from cycling accidents where'd you get the [ __ ] information keep children safe and hard-working busy mothers minds at peace by supporting this event we're not just enforcing a law we're creating a safer community keep more offspring protected put people are off to be protected put helmets on make [ __ ] I know I think mean graces at the Bentson Avenue I definitely did the work on that if I tried I would have done the best they did not try it all that was my fault there is an infamous quote experience is the best teacher but that shouldn't be misconceived for being the only way to learn throughout my life throughout my life experience has been my main source of collecting wisdom I am grateful for the about the valuable lessons that life itself has taught me but there is knowledge that I have missed out on by not attending school and practicing a studious life such as long as [ __ ] the right to seek a studious lifestyle I will forever be deeply saddened by the pure and simple fact that I was disputed from learning how to graph amazing mathematic functions blending its excluded yeah I said that these are discluded ok [ __ ] learning how to grab an amazing mathematical functions like a parabola I'm often troubled and haunted by the thought of being humored by a group of young studious adolescents because I have not established the proper skill set to locate the hippocampus on a detailed animation of a brain study and forever be grateful my son be ravenous for knowledge and keep your mind open to wisdom that may forever change your life and then to just be relatable to a younger version of me ever has Grayson packs days we have a great summer hag say you know what I really respect is your work ethic in you also you take it really you have been really seriously to a person I didn't take it seriously can you just [ __ ] we can you read yours yes experience is the best way to learn because the experience you had was personal therefore many more have you been trying to learn by empathizing with someone else's life experience for example if I see someone else get burned by the fight by the fire that didn't happen if I see someone else get burned by a fire versus if I get burned by a fire I'm gonna learn much better when I burn myself because that [ __ ] hurted me yeah but I wanted to add a little bit of personality to say I almost feel like it's about stuff it's all about personality inside learning by reading about something is equivalent to not learning because I don't retain anything when I read not a damn thing no but you're supposed to say oh she [ __ ] said one more thing business the whole entire yeah the whole purpose of the promise did you're supposed to say why experience isn't the only way to learn you said it is the only way to learn all right my turn learning is the world's greatest gift to humans exposed to things so that we can constantly grow progress throughout our years of existence look around the other one there is so much to absorb never limit yourself you can learn how to replace the car tire once you break down to the side or you could be talked beforehand and get yourself off the highway quickly without having to figure it out and accidentally getting pasted by a vehicle traveling at a high velocity although you will never know how does it really do something before you do it is important to have pyro knowledge so you can possibly save your own life I mean it's been hard he's got a name he got a C and I got it holy [ __ ] I really want to do it should we use [ __ ] digit yeah yeah happy finals we're just not gonna take a test we just didn't even show up for our math test we're gonna be doing a very complex algebra to test guys time for math this is no practice this is an algebra to test we studied third grade math this is a very vital to protest and I know as I learned all this [ __ ] he's ready for math test this is two one go [Music] I'll arrange it why do you need to know this in life you don't I haven't used it no offense I'm just looking at a bunch of numbers and seeing if they can go into each other yeah it's not exactly what I'm doing also guessing a lot this is really stressing out you know I don't remember any of this I thought it was gonna do good in the naked so like you're actually writing on that Romero how to do this so this is such a hard test this heart this test is [ __ ] up there's no [ __ ] phones in class closing class you cheat on your final no I'm talking done can you stop cooking your foot I'll try to focus sorry Matt is we learn about this let's all pass them around and then we can all grade each other's tests boop Emma's do battery okay sorrow is so are you so [ __ ] you Emma you're going suffering I thought you didn't do this you have not gotten any right it's gonna kill the [ __ ] up I don't trust Grayson reading my paper he's gonna sabotage my score well I actually started guessing out ten questions in and started guessing everything Eggen look we don't do better when he started to do that I'm gonna say the last page three one two three okay feel good about yourself because you did better than reading for our history test we're gonna be seeing if we remember where all the states are located on the US map now we only have two minutes to complete this if you don't finish you don't finish and that's your problem history test okay one two three go [Applause] I would not cheat on you today I really would but why am i doing better than I'm expecting I'm like really confused there's so much to do oh my remain stressed out we keep going no pencils down oh you didn't so [ __ ] good why is smart okay so let's count how many we got 21 out of 48 so I got that again you got 38 in my defense I was writing out the full names of each state because I just like like doing that better as you're full for the science test we're gonna be doing a group lab let's do it oh my god remember the exact measurements I remember the exact measurements No are you [ __ ] are you serious people want to see science do the worst my step is done forever please are you serious I'm gonna I'm gonna get yelled at I was so [ __ ] gonna chemistry so like I don't know what's going on here okay ready guys this has to work go hold it no see on this we didn't say hello and I guarantee that well should we try warm instructions you [ __ ] up because I won this for 2 to 3 teaspoons of vinegar into the water using the bottle funnel Emma quickly tip the vinegar so it mixes with the science project don't do this again well I'm showing them how it [ __ ] you want a new row in the horse video so thank you guys so much for watching this video I hope that finals went alright for you we had actually a lot of fun doing this so maybe if you guys study with your friends try to make finals fun give this video a thumbs up what is this we also made a video on their channel that's super fun those bottles really stressful and I know they're not new these festivals your so if you're going here if you're doing your bottles right now see

-emma chamberlain",2019-05-30T19:57:43Z,292519,5590263,17371,"*slurp* I'm ready, hah. (intro music) (twinkle) Hi guys. Last time I saw you guys I was seventeen. I am now eighteen. I just wanted to get that out of the way. That has nothing to do with today's video, I just wanted to get it out of the way. So now that that's over, let's talk about what we're doing today. I sound like I'm talking to a class. Okay guys, so today we're gonna be learning about shapes. Anyway... So I've been a little bit M.I.A. for like the past seven days or so. No like, two weeks almost, because I was sick. I had one of the worst sicknesses I've ever had this past week. I could not do shit. I couldn't leave my house, I couldn't cook for myself, I couldn't fucking get up... *burps* ...and go to the bathroom. I felt so shitty. *burps again* Luckily I'm good now. But anyway, I was sick as fuck for seven days. And as you might imagine, I was BORED. I was really bored because I was just laying on my couch, watching my TV, for seven days. As you can imagine, as the seven days passed, I started watching weird shit on the internet. You can only spend so many hours on YouTube, watching shit, before you just accidentally start watching weird shit. Like it just happens. I stumbled upon some weird stuff, some satisfying stuff, some cool stuff-- like I stumbled upon a bunch of stuff. So in today's video I decided, in honor of me no longer being sick, in honor of all of the amazing content creators that created the content that kept me entertained while I was sick In today's video, I'm going to recreate all of the weird fucking videos that I watched while I was sick. I'm gonna recreate all of the types of videos I watched... ...while I was sick. I hope that makes sense. So let's get started. I need to explain to you the types of videos that I was watching so that you're not just completely confused cause like, we have to have some sort of structure in this video or else... (transition music) The first type of video I stumbled upon was frozen food reviews. Hello food fans, today I'm going to make something that's relatively easy to prepare. I get to lick the spoon so that is good. Everything is cooked very nicely, it's ready to eat. This might seem a little bit confusing, like wh--why? Well, there's a backstory. In my explore page, I saw this video called ""Eating Watermelon with my Clone."" So naturally I clicked on that. And I watched that video. It was a great video. I liked the video so much that I clicked on this man's channel. And while I was scrolling through his channel, another video caught my eye. It was a video about a frozen dinner and him reviewing it. So I clicked on that. Next thing I know, I have watched literally thirty videos, straight, of this man reviewing frozen dinners. And I couldn't stop. Hello food lovers! Today we're gonna be eating this veggie... ...veggie loaf frozen dinner. This was only a few bucks from the store. Never tried this one before, so I'm pretty excited, a little bit nervous. So, it just says to cook for four minutes. So let's do that. Alrighty. Well, on the instructions it says that you're supposed to take it out after microwaving for four minutes and mix around the potaters so I'm just gonna do that real quick and then put it back into the paper. Or maybe that's not what I'm supposed to do, hold on let me look it up. Ooh, does that look scrumptious. Alright we're gonna plop this back in the oven for one more minute. Alright. Well, I cooked it for another minute, and then I let it sit and it's time to eat, so let's try these veggies. Mhmm. Not too bad. Sauce from over here kinda seeped over here. Tastes pretty good to me, and I'm not gonna lie, think I kinda like that. Let's try the potaters. Also good. Lacking in the salt department. Nothing you couldn't fix at home. Now let's try the loaf. Ohhh... Ehh... What's in there? Okay. The flavors are good, texture's a little bit mushy, but what do you expect with a loaf? I think overall I'm gonna give this a four out of ten. Uhh, I wouldn't eat it again but I don't hate it. Alright. Well I hope you enjoyed, and uh, thank you so much for watching. Alright. (transition music) The next type of video that I was binge watching was these videos from the channel Hollywood Fix. [Man filming] Hey what's up Dr. Phil? How are you today? [Man filming] Good, how are you? I don't know, I can't think of that. [Man filming] Have a good day. You too. [Man filming] Okay, I will. Now, Hollywood Fix is like this... How do I explain this? They're like these, almost paparazzi videos, where this guy goes to popular locations in L.A. and waits for celebrities to come and show up so he that can interview them, kind of without asking. He just shows up and is like ""HEY."" They've interviewed a bunch of people that we know and love, like YouTubers, people like Justin Bieber. Like they interview everyone. *burps* And they're pretty fucking entertaining to watch. [Amanda] Yo yo, so uh, standing outside of Alfred on this fine Wednesday morning and I uh-- Pretty sure that's Emma Chamberlain in that white car right there but not, not for sure. She might be going to get some Alfred, pretty sure that's a popular spot for her. I guess uh, guess uh we'll find out if she uh, she makes movements. Oh oh oh, I think she's getting out. Yeah that's, that's Emma Chamberlain. That's Emma Chamberlain. That's Emma Chamberlain. Yeah. Yeah. Yooo. Oh, she looks like she's running. Alright we'll catch up with her later. [Amanda] Yo yo yo Emma. Emma Chamberlain. - [Amanda] Emma Chamberlain.
- Yooo. [Amanda] Yo how are you today? I'm alright. [Amanda] Yeah? I'm alright. - [Amanda] Y-y-yeah?
- Yeah. [Amanda] What are you doing on this fine morning? How you been? Umm, ya know, umm... Just got my coffee... [Amanda] Yeah, what'd you get? Uhh, I forgot. Cold brew with espresso in it. It's pretty good. Try it sometime. [Amanda] Yeah yeah yeah. So uh Emma, the word on the block is that uh, is that you don't shower but uh here at the Hollywood Six we like to believe that uh that you shower, so what's your favorite shower product, Emma Chamberlain? Alright yeah, I mean I'm really into the back scrub brush. I think that shit really helps, I do have bacne. So, maybe cut that part out. Alright. [Amanda] Uh so uh, so uh, so uh, uh Emma, Emma, Emma... Yeah yeah. [Amanda] Um, so uh, is is is uh, is uh... *laughs* [Amanda] Yo, so uh, Emma, you uh, you been working on a podcast recently called uh, ""Stupid Genius,"" right? That's true. [Amanda] Yeah yeah, so uh, how do you determine if someone is a stupid genius, or if they're just stupid or just genius? I ask them a quick little question about, usually something like--I don't know, like-- *laughs* Bro you good? You just tripped a little bit. [Amanda] Yeah no no no Emma Emma, I'm out in the field a lot. *laughs again* Yeah you know I usually just ask them a little question, maybe like about politics or something, see what they say... And then I go from there. [Amanda] Yeah yeah, but you've been looking pretty fresh recently. You've been rocking a lot more designer than usual, leading people to believe that L.A.'s changed you. Do you feel like L.A.'s changed you, Emma? You know, I think it's helped me evolve as a person. I wouldn't say it's changed me, though. I think I'm still the same old me. - [Amanda] Yeah y-y-yeah?
- Yeah. [Amanda] Well uh, well uh, what's your favorite designer brand right now Emma? You know, after going to a few Louis Vuitton shows, I'm gonna have to say Louis Vuitton. I don't know, they're just a classic... Classic... *rawrs like t-rex* [Amanda] Y-y-yeah, so Emma, so uh, I-I-I've heard that you're a frequent uh, customer of Alfred coffee, is that true? That's true. [Amanda] Are they the best coffee in town, Emma? You know, Phil's might have to be a close second, I'm not gonna lie to you bro. [Amanda] And uh, do you feel like the amount of coffee that you ingest-- Sorry I'm yelling, cause there's a truck. Do you feel like the amount of coffee that you ingest affects your bowel movements? *laughs* - Absolutely. On a daily basis.
- [Amanda] Yeah yeah. I mean, I haven't had a solid shit in months, so, yeah. [Amanda] So uh, so uh, uh, what do-- Wha--if you could say one thing to your fans right now Emma, what would you say? I'd say ""hey, be yourself..."" *awkwardly passing people* ""...diarrhea is normal."" *more awkwardness* ""And be yourself, alright? Don't forget about that."" [Amanda] Y-yeah Emma. So uh, so uh, so uh-- *gags* [Amanda] There's rumors on the block that uh, that uh... *laughs* (mocking Amanda) THAT UH [Amanda] Yo yo yo Emma, so uh, there's been a big debate recently around these parts about whether or not wearing socks without tennis shoes--or tennis shoes without socks is a-- - Oh! *laughs* --is a non-necessary tactic. Alright. What's your opinion on people who like to wear their tennis shoes without socks? You think that's gross or you think they're doing the most? *laughs* Yo, Imma be real with you. If you don't want your socks to show, wear no-show socks. It's not 1975, alright? This shit exists. [Amanda] Y-y-yeah. Wearing sneakers without socks is a recipe for a bad smell, alright? And I know about bad smells, cause I don't shower, alright? - [Amanda] For sure, for sure.
- Yeah. [Amanda] So uh, my last question for you Emma... You're gonna fall in a pot hole, right now. *laughs* [Amanda] Thanks man, you really look out for your fans. That leads me to my final question, or maybe my second-to-final question, I feel like I have a few more. Alright. [Amanda] Um, wha--how's your relationship with the people who watch you? Yo, we're homies, all of us. Everybody who watches my videos is my best friend. We're all just a big squad of homies. Yeah, those are my bros, dude. [Amanda] Yeah y-yeah, so Emma, how do you see out of those glasses, though, Emma? Yo, I can't see shit right now. *laughs* [Amanda] Okay, cool. And uh, and uh maybe my final question is: would you mind ending this off with like an interpretation of your favorite Vine (R.I.P.)? *laughs* *cringes* ""My name is Jeff."" - [Amanda] Oh, funny.
- Alright, fuck off. [Amanda] No no no, maybe one more question, maybe just one more question Emma, since we're not at your car yet. Alright, let's do it. [Amanda] Umm umm... So I hear that you been taking SoulCycle a lot recently... Yes. [Amanda] Well uh, my question for you is: does the bike ever hurt your... ...ass? Well, I'm not gonna lie to you. I've had a few ass bruises from SoulCycle. But that's why I keep coming back, cause I think that's a little fun. You are getting---no you can't walk backwards in this area! You just--you can't! *laughs* [Amanda] Lookin really fresh recently, I just wanna say thank you for taking the time to talk to Hollywood Six-- Oh oh oh, big jump Emma, big jump! Nice! Thank you so much for talking to us Emma. You the realest of the real. We'll be sure to catch up with you later, and have a good day Emma. Yo, she was so nice. That was the Emma Chamberlain interview, Wednesday, October 96th. Having the best day of the summer, Yea--BYE EMMA! Peace out. [Amanda] Yo yo yo, Emma Emma Emma, how are you today? I'm good, how are you? [Amanda] Good, killing it, crushing it. You look great, you look good. Thank you. [Amanda] Yeah so I just have one question for you really quick Emma. Alright. [Amanda] Um um, so people recently have been concerned about the fact that you possibly switched from coffee to tea and I was just curious--I mean based on your uh, your car it doesn't look like that's the case--but I'm just curious if that's the truth. What caused that transition for you, Emma? Yeah, no--well you see, I was sick for... - [Amanda] Oh man Emma, I'm so sorry.
- ...for some weeks. I'm, I'm alright now, but... [Amanda] Yeah, that's not cool, though. Yeah, it wasn't. [Amanda] Like that post-coachella sickness, yeah? No, I had another one... - [Amanda] Oh wow, wow, wow!
- ...after that. - Yeah, and I was not okay.
- [Amanda] Wow Emma, you're so frickin brave and strong. I know. [Amanda] You fought your way through that, man. I know, I did. [Amanda] I'm proud of you. Thank you. And, and then uh, you know, and I went and I got, got some breakfast and um... And I just--and I was like ""coffee might get me fucked up so I need to like tone it down and drink some tea."" [Amanda] Yeah yeah, where'd you get breakfast at, Emma? Yo, I don't fuckin know what the name of it was. [Amanda] Yeah, cool c-c-cool cool. Well looks like you're tryna get outta here so I'll let you go. Thank you so much for talking to the Hollywood Six today, Emma. Yeah thank you, thank you. Yeah have a good one Emma, have a good one. Yo, that was Emma Chamberlain, sweetest girl in the world. She's so nice. She talks to us all the time. Really really really cool. So that's that, that's this interview for January 5th, 2090. [Amanda] Yo so Emma Emma Emma... ...yo you've had a pretty insane year, and uh, and uh, it's clear to see that you're frickin killing it man. Like everyone's so prou--woah woah woah, Emma, Emma. Is this your car Emma? [Emma] It is. [Amanda] What'd you do there Emma? How'd you do that? Aww, bro... - [Amanda] How'd you do that Emma?
- Shit. [Amanda] You haven't--you have an accident? - No...
- [Amanda] Are you okay, Emma? - Yeah...
- [Amanda] Is your neck okay, Emma? [Amanda] What happened, Emma? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you emotional. Is this something hard that you've gone through that you wanna talk about with your fans Emma? Do you want the people to know about your accident? I've been tryna keep this from you guys, but... I was driving into my garage and... - I was having a rough day.
- [Amanda] Yeah yeah I drive into my garage too, Emma. [Amanda] That's something we have in common. *coughs* Ehh Umm, yeah, and like, I just... ...fucking like, turned too fast, and like I dented--hey! *laughs* Don't fucking look there. [Amanda] Yo Emma is that a dog in there? [Emma] Yeah. [Amanda] Yo yo yo, what's up little man? - [Amanda] Yo Emma your dog looks pretty wack.
- [Emma] It's a girl. [Amanda] Your--your dog looks pretty wack. It's not even my dog. - [Amanda] How long you had a dog, Emma?
- It's not even my fucking dog. [Amanda] Oh yo yo yo yo what's up Mr. Scruffins? - It's a girl.
- [Amanda] Sorry about your accident... ...and uh, I wish you the best this year Emma. I know you're gonna keep killin it. - Thank you.
- [Amanda] You look fresh... ...you look fine, like the world isn't ready for you Emma. All right have a good one. See you later. Bye. That's Emma Chamberlain, getting into her car. Looks like she's gonna exit now. BYE EMMA! [Emma] Bye! [Amanda] Looks like she's having some trouble getting in the car. Those things can be difficult when you're under the stress of a recent accident, and a dog. She's gonna start the vehicle soon. (car engine starts) Yo that was uncalled for man. Hey! [Amanda] Yo Emma that was rude as fuck! I'm comin in Emma! (transition music) You cannot judge me for this one, please. My friend Amanda and I were sitting on my couch, we were watching YouTube on the TV and we stumbled upon boyfriend ASMR. (whispering) Does your head hurt? Yeah? What about your stomach, are you feeling a little bit 
nau--nauseous? Oh, okay. Don't worry, babe, we can check. I don't know if I've ever told you this, but... ...whenever I was sick I used to be really scared of thermometers. (normal volume) Boyfriend ASMR is like, well... How do I even describe it? It's pretty fucking weird. It's basically where these teen boys act like they're your boyfriend, and do it in ASMR. And me and Amanda were fucking crying, sitting on my couch watching this shit, cause it's so funny. And I'm actually so excited to recreate this. Let's do it. (whispering) Good morning, babe. *cringe intensifies* How'd you sleep last night? Good? Same. Are you feeling better after y-- --because you were just sick? Oh no, you're not feeling good? When I get up I'll get you a water. We need to get you hydrated, okay babe? Me and you didn't really get to catch up last night because I got home late from work. How was your day yesterday? That's amazing. I hope you and Shelby had fun. 'Kay well what are you up to today? That's amazing. Babe, have I ever told you that you look so beautiful in the morning? I tell you that a lot? It's cause it's true. Babe, I've been thinking. I know we're just seventeen, but I think we should get married soon. No, I'm serious. We could run away, you know. Me and you, and... ...go run away to fuckin... ..um.. ...uh R--Russia or something. Nobody could find us. Not even Mom and Dad. I don't know it's just a thought. (wait Emma is this couple incestuous??) Why aren't you down for it? Babe?!? wE'rE nOt ToO yOuNg! Babe... You're telling me you wanna finish high school? And live a normal life? And you don't wanna elope to Russia? Babe... No, babe! *awkward tap* Hey! Stop crying. *pokes your eye out* I'm sorry I scared you with my ambitious ideas. Let's just act like that didn't happen. I'm sorry. My love for you got the best of me. I just wanna be with you forever. Cause you're my baby. *laughs* (normal) Can't do this anymore! (whispering) You know... ...it's weird, like, we've been dating for like... ...two months. I mean... ...we're really like, getting close, you know? Like me and you, like... ...I feel like I know--I feel like I've known you forever, you know? But like I still don't know that much about you. So like why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself? I'll ask you some questions if you want. Alright. What's your favorite color? (wow, deep Emma) Mhm, magenta's my favorite, too. Actually it's not, I just said that cause I wanted to agree with you. But... ...it's okay. *laughs* What's your favorite food? *mouth noises* Split pea soup? That's fucking weird. People don't usually really like that, but, whatever. Where do you like to... ...go on the weekends? Trampoline parks? That's kinda weird too. You know what babe, I don't really like this game. I don't-- I think that there's some things that, it's probably better if I don't know about-- Anyway, I forgot you were feeling sick... earlier... ...when I asked you that, if you were feeling sick. You know... ...you said you were feeling sick.... ...cause you woke up feeling sick. Do you want me to go get you a glass of water? No, it's totally fine, I can. It's not a big deal. No I'm serious, I'll go get you a glass of water. But first let me give you a little kiss. *smooch* Ugh, that sound was disgusting I have to do that again. *better smooch* How was that? I've been working on that. Alright, fine. I'll go get you a glass of water. You stay here, alright? Don't leave, okay? Just stay right here. Be right back. For you. I'll come back for you, okay? Get you a glass of water. Alright. See you in a sec, babe. Stay safe in here. Don't go running off or anything. Love you. (door closes) (transition music) This is very obvious. This is like not even weird, this is like not even unusual, this is not rare. There's nothing unique about this type of video, and it's soap cutting ASMR. *satisfying* *more satisfying* *most satisfying* But I'm not kidding you though. I watched HOURS worth of soap cutting on my tv. I would look up ""soap cutting ASMR compilation"" and I would just watch the whole hour. And it never got old. So that happened. OOOH. Oh man. Dats nice. OOO! Okay, I swear to god if this doesn't work I'm gonna be pissed. Oh my god it's not gonna work, huh. NOO!! That is not the result I wanted! Dang it. Okay it's still kinda cool though I guess. Nooooooo. Unghhhh. Okay that was fucking annoying. Oooo. Why does soap cutting take talent? What did we learn from this? And also these soaps smell so bad. Why do these soaps all smell bad? Do not buy this soap it smells bad. Oh my god I almost just cut my fucking finger off. Don't try this at home kids! Eww the soap smells bad, okay I'm done with this soap, it's--it's too--it smells too bad. *gasp* Wow, this is kinda fun. Okay, that was, kinda fun I guess. This is just not working out. I'm not doing this right, now I'm just getting mad. Fuck this shit, I don't know how to do it. That's it for today's video. I hope you guys had fun. I had fun. You know, it's weird like when you see people do things on the internet, it makes you wanna try it. So this video was very satisfying for me because I feel like it was like something I wanted do and then I got to do it. So I'm really glad we got to do this together. I'm also just grateful I'm not sick anymore. I was not okay. At all. Glad we're doing better now. Okay, well I love you guys a lot, and uh you're awesome, hope you guys are happy and healthy. Don't get sick. Swear to god. I have new merch, so go buy that if you want. Okay bye, heh. Byyeeee. Buy my merch please. Isn't it kinda fun? Okay bye. Link in bio. Link in bio! That kinda seemed like weirdly sexual. Okay bye. (outro music)"

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-05-16T18:58:46Z,329777,6671325,12764,"You guys, kind of fucking sad. I'm bored, all my friends are busy. I have been doing boring stuff all day. Like going to the doctor and running errands and shit You know when you are like in the mood to just do something fun you know. But there's like nothing to do cause there just isn't,  that's kinda how I'm feeling right now. I just feel like there's nothing fucking fun to do. I feel like I'm just stuck in my house, and it's Sunday night perfect time to get crazy and I have nothing to do and I'm by myself and it's 10 o'clock. What do I do? You know what let me think for a second... Oh my god, you know what? I'm gonna go out on the town. Me and you we're going out on the town We're gonna go fuckin rage. We're gonna go party. We're gonna go fucking rage. I think that's a perfect idea. I don't see anything wrong with it. Okay. Well, it's ten o'clock. So I need to start getting ready right now. Okay. First we need to fix, uh, this mess. So I just showered, ooh. Ugh, that tasted bad. I need to blow-dry this. Oh wait, hold on. I have not even brushed my hair yet. Okay, let's not, let's take it one step at a time. We're gonna be doing a get ready with me okay, we're getting ready with me to go fucking rage. Hair, makeup, outfit the whole nine fucking yards because guess what? I'm bored. I hate doing this can you tell I don't know how to blow-dry my hair I don't think I am doing a good job It's done. If I'm going to be in public, I think it's really important that I brush my teeth. That's not a, that's not a look. The thing about going out, alright, is that you never know who you're going to talk to and you never know how close you're going to be talking to em. Not only that but I might kiss someone. That's not happening. Oh Oh shit. You can't be going out on the town looking like this. I don't think anyone would talk to me like this. Is the lighting good? I don't know I don't really know how to use my camera. So we're nice and close up What a nightmare. So let's do our makeup. Recently I've actually been getting a little bit more into makeup because I got my new makeup routine going and I think it's working for me. So I'm gonna be using a moisturizer k Let's talk. Um. Ugh, god. This is just the worst part of the video is when I have to figure out what to talk about. Cause it's like okay I have the concept down for the video, but then it's like how do I fill the gaps? Next I'm using this. You know I use these products and I really don't know what they do, but I just use them anyway because I think that it's what I'm supposed to be doing. Oh my god, my teeth are so yellow How do you get rid of that? Is it possible? Help. Next I'm using this product, thank you. Makeup, like getting your makeup done/doing it yourself is similar to coffee. Now let me explain this metaphor to you. When you get a coffee from a coffee shop, It's always better than the coffee that you made yourself Similarly to how when you do your makeup at home, it's never as good as when you get it done. Let me take a next step on this. I have gotten my makeup done four times within the past like week. I can guarantee you that I looked way better than normal all of those times and what I'm about to do right now I'm gonna look fine and I'm gonna look better than before but I'm not gonna look that great But what I'm wondering is what are they doing that I'm not doing? What am I doing wrong? Oh my god I never held up this product. I could literally never be a beauty guru. Okay, I feel attacked because I feel like I could never do what they're doing. This already looks wrong. You know, the funny thing is is that I'm not actually going to the club So I'm kind of just doing my makeup for no reason right now That's a hard pill to swallow. Holy shit I have a whole ass vein right there What? Is that okay? Have I had that for a long time? I don't think I've ever noticed that is that like a new addition to my head never seen that on me before don't forget to Put it on your ear too. Right? Why am I always bored? I'm not bored though I'm never really bored cuz I always have shit to do but I always feel like I'm bored , you know I at least have one point in the day. I'm like, you know what? I'm bored Should I do like a dark smokey look on my eyes today? Like I feel like I should spice it up and do something I normally don't do I did good old smokey eye or something. I don't even know like is that even a thing anymore? I feel like smokey eyes were like a thing in like middle school Like everybody would like Google smokey eye tutorials and wear them to school on special occasions. Maybe that was just my school Maybe that was just me, although I never knew how to do a smoky eye So I guess you know, what does that say about me? But why does my makeup look so bad right now? The one time I'm doing it on camera That's like not chill, why did it turn out like that? I feel like I'm normally better You know, I'm kind of tired right now, like why am I getting ready for the club right now? Like I'm fuckin tired and I'm not even going to the club. So this video, just, does it even have a point? K what's the next step my makeup routine? I always forget what order I do everything in um, is it time to contour? I I Don't really remember, whatever Contouring is scary for me because I really don't know how to do it. I I brought this on the plane and it exploded everywhere as you can see that worries me, but I'm just gonna put it on a brush That was a mistake. Yep, that was a mistake. Yeah. I think I'm just doing bad cuz I'm under pressure right now maybe How do I fix what I've done? I don't know what I'm doing, I thought I did I got all cocky in the beginning of this. I was like yeah I'm getting really good at makeup recently Now here we are. Now we're gonna put on some bronzer that's powder now I'm getting lazy with this. Okay, definitely applied a little bit too much bronzer, but never hurt nobody. My god, nose contour, scary. Normally that works and it really didn't that time. I do really enjoy doing makeup though I think it's really therapeutic Like when I'm about to go somewhere which you know doesn't really happen very often, put on some loud ass music Just start jamming out and like doing my makeup. I love that. It's weirdly a form of therapy I never thought I would say that but here I am Highlighter, oh this is so fun That was way too much, fuck. I put too much, I put too much. This is my favorite lip stuff It's so good. Ooo this looks bad. Who am I trying to impress though. Ooo Now that we've done that. I'm gonna try to do a crazy eye shadow look just gonna kinda wing it based on what I've seen people do before. Could go potentially really bad Willing to take that risk. I'm not actually going in public. Taking this palette (when she takes out the naked palette instead of you know who's) Remember 8th grade. It was so fun. Remember, 8th grade? Yeah should I do like a dark look with like dark grey and shit? That'd be a vibe. Let's do it. Let's just do it. Maybe if I look good enough I will go to the club that was a joke Aww, that's really bad, oh, ooo, you know what it's okay How did I get here? K, I'm not gonna give up. Every smoky eye starts out a little sus, right? This is fine. Oh, wait, that doesn't even, doesn't actually look that bad I mean it does but like. I'm gonna add some black into this look just cuz I think it'd be kind of entertaining That was a bad idea. Okay, wait, maybe it's not that bad. I just need to clean up around the edges I'm just trying to be positive here. Why, why am I like that? Should I add some eyeliner? At this point we have nothing to lose right? I Don't think that that looks good How did that happen? This is why I don't do eyeliner what made me think I could do it today. Am I just being lazy Is that the problem like am I not trying hard enough? I asked myself this consistently while doing things like if I tried a little harder would this have turned out better. Oh I look very Crusty right now did I like miss a step You know what? I feel like eyeliner doesn't really matter Once you've a mascara on cuz it kind of covers everything up, right But I have to throw a lot of mascara and no one will know about what happened in the past This is the makeup tutorial to do if you're trying to Make it so that no one talks to you while you're out and about no one's gonna want to you if you look like this At the club, I don't know why I keep saying at the club i have been more in like at a party But at the club just kind of rolls off the tongue. I don't go to clubs Like I don't even i don't even go to parties either and I'm not saying not to play them You know feel bad with my car. All right I don't want to go like I wouldn't want to go even if I was invited. Am I lying to myself? No, not makeup look is completed. Here's the montage now How do I look ? Okay so- Oh , so first let's start up with shoes , I feel like that's a- , that's a good start , right ? Okay, well I own one pair of heels so I think these will have to do oh So what am I wearing? You know, I have a few ideas Number one. These pants could be amazing But do you know what I almost like these pants too much you ever feel like that? you're like I like this too much and I don't want to waste it like I want to wear these on a good occasion my Makeup looks terrible It's haunting me you know what this could be a vibe Okay some sweats, but they're like not just sweats they're kind of like track pants wearing that with heels. That's a vibe. Maybe I will wear a skirt. Hold on okay, so I have this skirt and I don't really know why I own it and I almost feel like if I wear this, um I'll never live it down. I don't think I should wear it. It just feels wrong. I need to pick out a shirt. Oh this could work see okay, that could work Oh Oh my god, this is fucking perfect. Look at this. Oh, yeah. Okay that's happening. But I need to wear something under this or else   Oh this is perfect. No Like I could just really just wear this under it. I can't just let my nipple out Like that's just like not chill, maybe it is. Oh should I pick out a purse? No, that's a lot of work, I'm not gonna do that. Okay. Let's get on the outfit. I need to just end this video I'm not even going to the club. Okay, I'm not even going to a party. I'm not going anywhere I'm literally gonna take my makeup off after I'm done filming So let's just get this video over with the whole thing is a fucking pointless mess Just kidding. It's fun Because if I didn't tell you that I wasn't going out on the town if I made you think that I genuinely was going out on the town This video would not be pointless but I told you that I was lying because I care I'm not gonna lie to you because we have a too much of a connection. You know for me to lie to you like that, let me just blend my makeup while I talk Alright well, that was fun, I'm gonna go to bed now, and that's it. Bye If this actually makes it to the Internet I'll be surprised *Music*"

-emma chamberlain",2019-05-05T18:55:38Z,352095,7923646,24965,"I I Never thought I'd do one of these again because I don't really like doing them that much wait Never thought I'd do one of these again because I don't really like doing them that much wait You don't you don't even know what I'm doing it if you don't know something that I used to do kind of consistently on my channel, but don't really do anymore because it doesn't really go that well is I used to do cooking with them is a lot but like there's this consistent pattern of the recipes not turning out very well I don't even think it's fully cooked. It's still wrong. No Do we do know it's literally rock Oh God It's literally sooo. It's no oh Let's just have a nice bite She's not great. You know, she sucks. I'm mad don't make this at home So I kind of gave up on the idea for a while. I was like you don't fuck this I don't even want cookie anymore. Like I'm sick of it, but my birthday's coming up I'm gonna be 18 and I was like, you know, what fuck this. I'm gonna do another commune with Emma. I'm gonna bake cupcakes Hopefully, I don't even know if I have a cupcake pan But if I do have a company pin, so we're gonna make cupcakes because I want to celebrate, okay Wait, let me see if I even have a cupcake pan. Hold on. Oh my god. I Don't even know who bought this that's amazing in order to celebrate properly information and fur thing We need to be we need to be and we need to make it fun and we need to make it crazy I also have a lot to talk about because I'm becoming a woman and I've never became a woman before so far I've just been a child But I'm becoming a woman there's a lot we need to discuss there's a lot we need to celebrate So we're back cooking with Emma last year for my birthday I made funfetti cake, and it went so bad that it ruined my whole birthday. So throwback Thursday to that last year I want the very homemade root. I didn't do a box mix. I made everything by hand from scratch and it went really bad so this year I was like, you know what the fuck that I'm not doing that again, so This year we're doing box mix. I know it's like actually kind of like depressing because normally I like can make everything You know what? It's my fucking birthday. At least I'll get to eat it You know like that would be nice like, you know, eat it for a change. So I Got some Betty Crocker makes honestly knowing me I'm probably still gonna cook this up somehow so it'll still be fun cuz they think the whole reason why this whole thing is fun is cuz I puff up so I have All my ingredients I even have a fucking cupcake in shit's revolutionary. I really didn't think I had that so let's see I've never really used this oven before so I don't really know how to use it. Okay? Oh god, press enter. Okay. Oh, wait what he said I straight up done that eases oven. I think I've reviewed it Why am I talking like that? Oh my obvious making a smell What what why are these in my fuckin oven? Okay, I feel vir I feel like for me one of my main character traits and personality traits is being a child I'm always the youngest in the group I'm always the kid that can't do stuff because of underage like all my friends are above 18 and I'm 17 so if we want to do something like get ear piercings or Go on a zipline Half the time I can't even go because I don't have a parent to sign off for me being 17 is fucking annoying I can't even go to the doctor by myself or the dentist. I can't find lottery tickets. That's annoying. I can't do shit I'm the only one that's having this issue still all my friends are like yo like Like I Even Have to fuck another parent but I am scared because I can't get away with as much shit being 17 is nice because I'm like I can't go to jail. If I do something bad. I can just go to juvie knock on wood If I would not survive in juvie But still like it's better than Jail now if I run a red light I'm going straight up to jail Like juvie doesn't even have a spot for me anymore And that worries me Wow, this is way too easy kind of feel guilty about how easy this is So do you know where the challenge is gonna come in when I'm decorating the cupcakes? I want my cupcakes to look good, but they probably wall better. Try it. Okay, okay Oh this even clean you Oh Also Yesterday when I was driving into my garage I accidentally dented my car really bad on my garage door not proud of that. But because I'm 17 My mom was like you're just young and stupid Well, those years are coming to a close like soon and I'm not gonna be able to get away with crashing my car But right now everyone's just like she's your stupid push. She's 17 but like the second I turn 18. It's like you're stupid You don't you're just help so much more accountable vice is not opening so I have to search Hmm this is fun. I like doing cake mix. I literally like three steps. This is amazing like this is too easy I'm basically fucking done at this point, which means that there's like less content for you So like sorry about it, but like it's my birthday So I just want to do what I want to actually it's not liver. My birthday's on May 22nd So get your gifts ready or whatever. They don't like my birthday worst day of the year hate it for the past few years I literally haven't celebrated my birthday because I just refuse I don't like that level of attention I know the amount that I talk you would think like Oh, Emma loves her birthday because she's conceited. I actually hate my birthday I also don't like birthday parties in that type of shit because it's way more fun for the guests than it is for the actual Birthday girl and that is a fact when you throw a birthday party It's literally only fun for the guests because they don't have to fucking worry about the planning. They don't have to worry about shit They're not the ones having a midlife crisis I'm straight-up gonna have at least one mental breakdown about the fact that I'm 18, because that shit is scary Oh my god, this smells so good. Is this what it looks like when you're actually doing it, right? Oh my god I don't know. I'm just not a big fan of birthdays like this year. I'm straight-up disappearing on my birthday I don't even want to see my friends. I'm just gonna fucking lay in bed lock my door No one's allowed to see me for the whole day. My birthday's May 22nd, which makes me a Gemini. I'm homeless Cos I was almost a tourist if I was born ten hours earlier, I would be a Taurus. I know that's not what happened whoa, I am a Jedi, which means that everyone hates me for some reason every Gemini's we're like supposedly really like Insane or something by the Gemini and I think I'm a pretty good person. Like I've never heard anyone Well gentlemen isn't really made out to be evil I think that I matched some of the traits like I definitely talk a lot and I'm definitely annoying I don't have any of the evil Gemini traits. I don't think okay. So I want to make this cake funfetti They didn't have any funfetti mix on the store So I'm just gonna add sprinkles cuz I think you can do that, but I didn't google it so maybe not I don't know how much to add so I'm just gonna kind of go off You know it was the worst for me though when I used to go to school. My birthday was during finals so like I didn't even get to have fun like my art has kind of been dead to me for like years now because they Just haven't been able to celebrate I either I'm having a mental breakdown or it's finals or both and now that I don't go to school anymore now I just don't like my birthday because I don't like the attention and there's always all this pressure to have a birthday party and then I don't fucking want to do that That's where I'm at with that know the thing about cooking is I just think I'm gonna clean this up, okay I know I'm gonna get salmonella, but I want to lick this. Nope I'm not gonna I'm not gonna like it. I want to that You know what shit's gonna be scary is when I'm not a teenager anymore it leaves I'm so gonna be a teenager after this birthday. Like I'm not getting that old yet but when I'm like 20 that's what I'm gonna start getting scared like the older I get then I'm gonna have to start getting Botox and like, you know, Like a boob job and stuff. Oh god I'm kidding. I don't know like being my age is so fun like being 17 is fucking annoying You know what you like turn like 20 And then you just start getting like you're not really in the know anymore of all twenties kind of young when you're like 25 You don't know shit anymore I don't leave a few more years of me being cool and in the note next thing I don't have to fucking get married. Oh God, I don't even want to get married well I do God, I don't even want to get married I may also just be jaded because my parents are divorced, but that is a personal issue A lot of girls are like oh my god. I can't wait to get married. Ah, okay There's no rush then I have to get have kids Straight-up have Children, like that's so scary Yeah, like everybody hates teenagers and like we get a bad rap and shit But like I don't care better than having fucking like have a baby throwing up on you. Don't get me wrong I want to have children one day but like not right now. Imagine planning on wedding Oh pick a kid up from school Like I I can't I mean I am 17, so he was like not get too ahead of ourselves The years are kind of like goin quick all of a sudden like I remember when I was 17 Oh, I am 17 still but like I remember when I turned 17 like this shit's goin by too quick I'm gonna probably die soon. Sorry. I'm just having like a midlife crisis Alright, so they're in the oven and see you and it's done Okay, so I think that they're done but I can't find my toothpicks to like test. So I'm just gonna get Okay. Well, I'm gonna let these cool that the way I need you're not mavin I'm the one these cool for like a long last time and then we're going to decorate them. It's gonna be really fun Okay, I don't know how to turn my oven off so I think I did it if not I'm just gonna burn my lap down We'll cross that bridge when we get to it Let's fucking do this they turned out great I mean, I know how they're gonna taste but first does I'm we're gonna do is a very easy one because you know what? I'm sick of failing and I fucking want to do something right for once Oh Oh I think I think made something similar to this before. So I feel like this design is gonna be really easy I don't feel like it's gonna upset me. Whereas if you like some of the other designs that we're gonna try today might upset me Why is this happening? Was I supposed to shake it first I Think about me and arts and crafts is that at first I'm like really good at it and then I just get like bored Okay, what is with this? Oh my god Does it mean the foot oh my god, I need my life. I should've bought fucking premade cupcakes from the store that already have decoration Sorry, I'm not talking about I'm just really busy right now I'm so fucking focused. Oh my god I ain't got nobody but me is eating these cupcakes because I'm straight up getting my saliva all up in it. Okay? That's not bad. It's kind of vibes. It could be worse did you know why first cupcake pretty good next what we're gonna make it's very Bday theme which I decided to do because you know what? It's my DNA Huh? Why are you rubbing out? I keep hurting myself. Oh my god. There's a literal hair in it Oh, I do not have the patience for this. Okay who used to watch Cupcake Wars? So does that show on fucking Food Network or something? That shit was so good? I got so into that the people on Cupcake Wars made it look so easy And made me think they're fucking aren't you gonna make me cupcakes? But apparently I'm not you know as this one might not turn out to that. Well, this looks bad. Yeah, I did bad. I Don't know what color that is, but who? So not my best work maybe I'm just like warming up okay this next one's a little bit fun and quirky so oh My god Wow, I don't really like sweet stuff that much but then again when it's in front of me Look Brown her poop emoji. I Need to stop eating the frosting how they work I'm literally gonna throw up. Yeah, I'm using my fingers Okay, because no one's eating these so it's not gonna hurt anyone Oh Fucked up Oh my god, it was like a seven year old made this fuck No, that's Honestly, this one's this one's just straight-up stat. You know what? I think it'd be cute if I didn't like a little flower it's spring and I don't know why I'm trying to come up with a reason why I'm doing a flower one. I'm just doing it What kind of flower should I do? Like, you know, mo some people are like, oh you have my favorite flowers would do with like I don't have a favorite flower I don't care. Okay, I'll do the tulip cuz that looks easy. Oh I know it looks like I'm not trying but I swear to God, I am it Just it's just not going left my egos down but like this still looks kind of good.

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-04-27T18:59:51Z,378727,11273044,13099,"Ooh, wow. So basically what happened today was that I woke up, and I was like: ""I need to film a video today"". I was like: ""Okay, I have some ideas"" and then I was like: ""Ok, wait, I actually HATE those ideas"". And then I was like: ""Ok well, I could just vlog my day"" because, you know, that's what I used to do. For old times sake, today I'm just fucking vlogging today! The first order of business.   All right, I need a new camera. Let me explain. So I'm a YouTuber, you know. If you- I mean- you would think that like I would have my equipment together. You would think that I would have all of the best equipment and that I'd be really knowledgeable about cameras. Absolutely not. I have three cameras. I own three, the one that I'm filming on and then I have two other ones. As of right now two of my cameras are broken. So the one that I've been using for like the past few months is this one, now this one's fine, the only problem is that the knobs are coming off. It's kind of just on its way out. Okay, then I have this camera. Some basic vlog camera. Only issue is that ... It's completely broken. I broke this one a while ago So this is not a shock to me like this has been broken for months. And then I have the camera that I'm filming on which is my like emergency camera It's the exact same as this except for that it's working. Problem is I don't want to use this camera as my like consistent everyday camera because I like to keep it as an emergency camera. It's kind of funny that I have absolutely, no filming equipment. Considering that I literally am a YouTuber.  Like this is what I do every day. Okay, and I have the worst equipment. I want to like step up my game,  like I want to get a good camera You know, I want to get a camera that's like really fucking crispy. Like I want you to see every single acne I have and I want you to be able to count it. I want it to almost look 3D through the screen. and I want a really nice tripod because let me tell you, not only are my cameras broken but also ... My tripod is broken. It's a mess. It's a Like basically all the equipment I have right now it's broken. I thought it'd be fun If right now, we went to fucking Best Buy and we bought me some new equipment like let's just refresh my YouTube equipment. I mean it makes sense. Like I should have good shit by now. I've always been a firm believer that equipment does not mean quality. Like I think you can have a great video and film it on your iPhone. I've filmed some great videos on my iPhone. Does having good equipment mean that your video is good? Absolutely not, but I think they can go hand-in-hand So let's go to Best Buy. I don't know what I'm buying yet. I don't know anything about cameras. I don't know what I'm even gonna get. Oh my god, I think I found the one. Oh my god, it's fucking hot in my car. Oh, fuck. Help. Okay. Look what I just got! I got, the Canon EOS M50. So, I don't know if this is good or bad, Um, I mean, it looks good. The guy at Best Buy said that this is a great camera and that it's better than the ones that I'm using currently and that's all I need to know also got two fucking beefy ass SD cards 128 GB. That was successful. I feel so good now that I have that because it just looks more professional. I think the quality is gonna be better. I think it's gonna be a good time. So let's just like Hope for the best with that. But now I don't know what I need to do I'm gonna see if I can get a nail appointment Why don't I get my nails in every fucking video? But like I really wanna get 'em done. Like you don't mind, right? Maybe you do. I'm gonna call my usual nail place even though they're kind of bad. Do you guys have any appointments within the next like 15-20 minutes? Okay, the reason why I like this place is because they always have availability. The only problem is that sometimes they say they have availability and then they don't and then it's like, ah fuck. What do I do? I just want to get my fucking nails done. Is that too much to ask? Oh my god. Imagine, imagine that. That was so annoying. My new camera would fucking never do that. Actually, it probably would. No! Hold on. Okay, we're just gonna hold it then, I guess, and why are there people riding bikes in the middle of the street going 2mph?! Like, get out of the street! Okay, now I'm just irritated. I need a good fucking way to mount my camera in the car. It's been too long of my camera fucking flying around this shit. Need to figure that out. For now, let's get our nails done. Today is gonna be fucking crazy. What color do I get my nails today? This is a consistent issue. I've been wanting to get neon nails for a while now, but now everyone's getting them. So now I'm like, okay, I don't really want them anymore cause I want to be different. Ooh, maybe I can alternate between like two colors, that could be kind of fire. You know what, we'll kind of cross that bridge when we get to it. I'm having a little predicament because I really want to go home. But the problem is, is that I'm getting my house cleaned right now because my house needed to be cleaned. I can't be home while my house is being cleaned. I mean like I could go get food but like I'm by myself and all my friends are busy. So like that makes me uncomfortable, I do not, do not like eating at restaurants by myself. I used to be fine with it, now it's not chill anymore. Also, I don't even know what kind of food I would want right now. I mean I could go to like sweetgreen, that could be kind of yummy right? A good salad, right? I don't even fucking want a salad right now. Napa get over here. You are gonna go stay with Emma for four hours. Yay. Come on, Napa. Time to be babysat by your fucking weird aunt. Yes, Queen! Okay, so I'm babysitting Napa for the next few hours. So that's another fun activity that we're gonna be working with today. Like it's, Okay, it's like my dog fix, like it's so nice when your friends have dogs, that are like chill because then it's like you get to reap the benefits, but then you don't have to like actually own them. Also Napa just got a haircut and she feels like a fresh baby seal. So, really excited to be hanging out with her for the next few hours. But she's so chill that we're probably gonna forget that we're even with her, but now that I'm like with Napa. I'm like, what do we do together? Napa, what do you wanna do? Napa, what do you want to do. Do you wanna go fucking like go to dinner like I don't know. Napa, do you want to go get coffee? Okay, I guess that doesn't sound good. Guys! Who's ready for a technology unboxing? Wait, I need scissors. I'm so excited about my fucking camera. I just wanna open it up Also, I ordered two tripods and they just coincidentally came in today. So actually we'll open these first because they're boring. Yay, this one's kind of crazy. Is it bendy? Oh, whoa Interesting, okay. So this one's kind of chill. This one's chill as fuck. Look at this bendy ass shit. That's so fucking chill. I bought two tripods cause I was like: okay number one: you can never have too many and number two: I don't know if they're gonna suck or not. So like, if I get two then there's a good chance one of them is gonna be like fine, although ordering like camera equipment off Amazon is like a really suspicious game. So Oh my god wait is this the exact same one? Wait what, you're kidding me. They're the exact same. What? I thought was gonna be bigger than the other one, okay, whatever moving on to the big guns. Welcome to unboxing. Alright, we have the lens. Okay Wow Okay, well we have to put the lens on though guys chill. Big moment, I don't know how to put on this type of lens. What? Should I like look up how to put it in, or should I just like keep trying? That's what she said Got it. I knew I was gonna figure it out. Let me put her on a tripod real quick just so that we can see what I'm gonna look like in public. Vlogging with this. Hey guys, welcome to vlogmas. You know, it feels really serious. I love it! Can't really film anything with this yet because, the battery isn't charged but like cute effort though. You know Still fun though. Look how pretty she is. Oh my god, she's so hot. Te tenn out of ten, would fuck this camera. anna ou Should I say that? I'm really happy with my new setup. Like I feel like I'm really gonna like be a better Youtuber now like permanently. So this is what its gonna look like when film my videos now, moving forward. Looks pretty cool, right? You know, pretty cool. Hm, I don't know? How do I look? Fucking perfect. Do I look like I just shit four times? Cause I did. Really, why? I - my bowels hurt. How are you feeling? I'm feeling like Napa. It's actually the next day because last night, you know when I was babysitting Napa our play date just started like getting so fun that like I forgot to turn on the camera and then I went to bed cause I got like super tired from the playdates So, guys there's some stuff we have to do. What are we even doing right now? We're going to Target. Oh my god. Okay. Oh my god almost died. We're going to Target right now to get a neti pot After Coachella, I got fucking recked, I got so sick. I literally was sick for like, what, like a week? It was fucking bad. Hated that. I mean, I'm good now, but I still have like a bit of congestion. I talked to multiple people and they told me to get a neti pot. So that was a sign to me that I needed to get a neti pot. I need to do a neti pot for my asshole. Do they have that, that's called an enema. Also if you're wondering like Emma why the fuck are you wearing makeup? It's because I popped all my blackheads and then I looked really ugly Then I was like, I need to just like cover it up a little bit. Also my hair is so long. It's to the point where I cannot style it anymore. Wearing it down is too long wearing it up, like falls down cause it's so heavy. Okay Anyway, I'm sorry, getting into my own personal issues. I love Target! Except for the symbol, looks a lot like a nipple. Maybe the fact the Target symbol looks a lot like a nipple, is like selective advertising. Like, cause you know how like sex sells. They want people to be like, oh Target supports nipples. Excuse me, what kind of camera is that? This is a Canon EOS M50, I think. Oh cool. It's a great camera, I just got it, literally yesterday. It's great. Great zoom lens. Oh my god. Is it Easter? Oh, it's Mother's Day. Okay. So where the fuck is the neti pot, like where do you even find that in a place like this? Where? Oh my god stop, okay wait this one - why is this one like so much bigger? Oh, wait are these the same size box? Yeah, it was just tipped like this. Oh my god, why? I'm so dumb. I was like this one's bigger. So I'm getting this. Pocky time. Recently, Amanda's been obsessed with Pocky. She's like been looking all around the store for it and we just have found it But we're not going to tell her. Okay, we're gonna try to find Amanda and tell her that they don't have any. Amanda! Where is she? We found them but they're out. They're out. I'll eat anything. So that prank just like didn't work at all, that was just not even a prank. Mood. Oh I want veggie sausage. Hm oh! I love veggie sausage. They're short. I'm literally getting three boxes. I love being vegetarian. Wait you have so many of those in your fridge. I ate all of them. No you didn't. Yes, I did. Like what is it to you? Like literally? What is it, to you? If I wanna fucking buy a lot of sausage, like I can like do that. Alright, sausage king. Why am I like crying right now? Everybody's so sensitive. Amanda, you attacked me. You attacked me. I was trying to help. You literally attacked me. Can we be friends again? Yes Okay, cool. Let's look at the facts, everybody is being sensitive. I'm just trying to have fun. I know but earlier in the car when I said - oh no no no, you attacked me. I admit right now to being fully sensitive. This is what hanging out with women is like. I picked this up to show Amanda like: 'you need to buy this' and then I never put it back down. And it's still in my head, I mean I guess I'll buy it then. You've gotta be kidding me. That is too much power for me. Oh shit. That's so fucking fun. Wait let's see how fast I can go. All right, go! We're timing it, we're timing it. Dude, you're a slow bagger you couldn't even work at Aldi. I'm so quick, I'm so quick, I'm so quick, I'm so quick, I'm so quick, I'm so quick. Targets literally, Targets literally like: Emma please come work. Oh my god, wait, look at me. Welcome to vlogmas. I was so excited to go home. And use my neti pot but then Olivia was like no we're going to an amusement park and then I was like, okay. It's actually a carwash. Oh my god. I'm excited. I don't do this often. Are you having fun? No, this is just giving me anxiety. This is like being in stranger things. This is stranger things role-playing. This is horrible I'm in the underground. It doesn't stress you guys out? No Oh my god it's getting loud. I hate carwashes. Oh my god, Napa's like not chill right now, she's like hating this. Amanda hates it too honestly. Carwashes are pointless. Is it societal, like, construct. You've definitely gotten your car washed before? Yeah, I'm part of society. So I don't, okay, yea I know I get it. I don't mind this. Have I complained once? No. Thank you. Have I complained once? Yes. Aaahhhhh. Oh geez. Looks kind of cool though, kind of aesthetic. Damn look at those water droplets? Okay. That was fun. Hopefully I get to do my neti pot soon. Let's do this shit. Wait, this would be a perfect setup for cooking with Emma. That's been noted. Okay, so I don't know how the fuck to do this. My mom used to do neti pots, like literally every day. I don't know why. Oh, she has a deviated septum. Here's the pot. Awww. Okay, here's a packet of something, kind of tempted to eat it but We'll decide if that sounds like a good idea later. Where the fuck is the directions. Where the fuck, help, wait There's literally like no directions. Do I need to fucking call my mom right now? Wait, why have I been looking at this for this long And not found the directions yet. Oh, I found it. Sorry, I just 240 milliliters of water. How the fuck am I supposed to know? So I guess I need to like boil water? Okay. It says 240 milliliters but like how do I measure that? Okay. I'm like not good at this, like I'm not an adult. Okay. Oh, yes Wait, I'm actually so fucking smart? Look at this shit. Okay, huh Queen! I was really good at chemistry, if you can't tell? I'll boil a little bit more just in case some evaporates. Yes, I am good at science. While we wait, let's make a coffee because um bae, which is me. I am bae. Is like really tired and I have no energy. So I was thinking we could do a little something right here with this. You know, this angle sucks. I'm not good at being a Youtuber. I'm really gonna try right now. Like I have a great new camera Like let's like utilize it. You know, why do I still have my fucking shoes on? Let me do my goth boots real quick, hold on. Oh shit Oh my god. Oh shit. Uuuuuaaaaaah. Wow Okay, so let me get this water a little bit less boily. I really hope I'm doing this right. I really don't want to like hurt myself. Okay I'm fucking hurt myself right now. That was a mistake. Got a little bit of the solution in my mouth, hopefully it's not poisonous. This is a chemistry experiment low-key. High school chemistry lab vibes. Now I'm getting PTSD. Okay, the problem is that the water Is like really hot right now. Okay, I'm gonna let it sit for a few minutes so that it doesn't burn my nose. Aaaaaaaa. Okay, let's do it. Is it working? Oh god, oh yeah, oh- Oh my god, oh, do I have a booger dripping? Oh my god I'll blur it out for you, I'm sorry. I needed this. Getting all the Coachella dust out right now. I look weird as fuck. Oh my god, wow! That was like really fun, okay wait let me blow my nose. Oh Wait, I actually feel really good. That was great. I'm really glad I did that guys, try the neti pot. This is not sponch, ponch(sponsored) Thank you audible for sponsoring today's video, as you can probably tell I'm sick right now. Reading a tangible book is not something I can do because I just don't have the energy for it. So that's why I've been listening to audiobooks on Audible! Audio books are great because you can listen to them anywhere, okay, like I'm saying anywhere like you could be like Anywhere, you know what book I love, Diary of a Wimpy Kid. They have that on Audible. Audible is unique and has an unmatched selection of audiobooks, original audio shows, news and comedy. Sorry, go to www.audible.com/emmachamberlain Or text emmachamberlain to 500 500. Start listening with an exclusive 30-day trial. One free audiobook of your choice and two audible originals sounds, like a good deal to me. I'm going to go back to bed now cause I'm sick. Okay, bye! Mwah What are we doing? We're gettin Geordie Shored up in here! Gonna get so tanned, oh my goodness, we're gonna get so tanned you won't even recognize me. So, what are we doing? Spray tan. Ye ye ye, that's what, okay. How's it going in there? It scares me! Get the ac - get the bacne! Okay you can turn it off. How's it going? I hate this. Now that Amanda is a Youtuber, what do you keep filming? I thought you were filming my ass and my ass looks really bad in these sweats. Turn around. No, it looks good. Really? Yeah. Wait, what did I need from here? Anyways. Oh eggs, and then I'm gonna buy pasta for tonight I'm gonna buy pasta for tonight. No, I'm gonna buy pasta for tonight. I almost just got duck eggs on accident instead of regular eggs. That zoom tho. Okay, that's it."

ReTwEEt iF U WanT a TUtOrial I guess it wasn't meant to be I get it the universe was like bitch. You're going to ruin everything.

I've loved even halter probably the last four years since I was a freshman in high school So like this is gonna go crazy for me. Why don't look sunburn. Is that possible do you get sunburn? This here. I'm out in a white wine I feel like I know what I'm doing now, and I know how to like have a good time I think the Cutie kotel is just not go too much pressure on it last year at too many expectations I was bound to get disappointed and so this area I just walked into a knows I live sure Also, the coffee is still good. That shit was so good. I want to get more tomorrow, but I'm gonna get seven tomorrow I'd only got one coffee today. That is sad. No wonder I'm tired right now. I literally had one coffee Oh my god, my moisturizer ran out bitch - you heard him. What even is this moisturizer? I really don't know the problems. I have at one time went into a store. That is like Focuses on skincare and I was like literally just healthy sadly. The back is still an issue Look at her fucking just inflamed or whatever now back knees are part of a brand. I Swear to god, I'm not high. Oh my god. How many people are gonna comment? Hmm okay. This could be fun. Woo. Do I look okay to you like I'm not time to use snack Wow We need to go grocery shopping tomorrow morning Nobody responded to me I Don't know why I just feel myself eating that there's no way that's entertaining for you. I have you don't look alive right now I just look at my fucking face. Nothing. That's funny about it is like most people go to Coachella We do a bunch of drugs and then they look like this but for me I went to Coachella. It didn't do any drugs and I still look like this so like that's not fair I literally feel like I'm about to shit and then vomit simultaneously. Okay, I love snacks Why don't you forget about me filming I can't believe the hotels already one third over I'm kind of sad then again I'm not cuz like it's really not that fun. It's all an illusion. I don't even know like am I having a good time? I Think I am good night Do you think I was sleeping right there I wasn't why can't I turn the camera off are you forgetting? To tell makes you feel kind of fun I have my yogurt I have veggie sausage and I have iced coffee in a Styrofoam cup that makes me think I'm drinking drugs Don't do it you're gonna jump every time I got my camera and all just weird shit happens. I've just heard off of bad luck This is my this is my this is my We're gonna go I'll tell you where everything's from the birth Do you live from eunuchs my Panther from Moschino and also heard that it's pronounced? Muskie now, I've heard machinima Skeena. Oh my god I really sounds sick right now My top is from American Apparel. My niggaz from dogs killed earrings are from I Have no fucking idea. So anyways, yeah, that's the T bitch. Who's excited. Are you excited? Yeah Are you saying? Are you fading? Are you excited? Yes Just took a fat shit now some yoga Takagi I Am so tired Taemin pelicans on him like an hour. I'm about to go crazy I really want to go home, but I have to see Taemin Paula first. I want to go to bed I don't go to there I said it I've never felt better bitch. It's literally midnight. We're drinking another coffee. We just watched a man Pauly was fucked up. It was insane So that was good that just made my whole night I located a panic attack at one point because crowds make me anxious but then once I saw teaming ball No matter I'm drinking coffee life is good. My third one of the day I've got my day two is over. I Am Just wrecked. I don't know how I'm supposed to survive another day this tame impala was amazing and stuff Like 6-3 know my 3:00 a.m. I'm thriving like on a normal day like it's really my be great But for some reason this shit's wiping me out one more day and then there's a one another 365 days then there's another Coachella and I'm probably gonna end avoided that one too coach. I was fun It is it's fun, but it's also like it's not that what it is I'll have fun for like 20 minutes and then it's like not fun anymore Then another 20 minutes of fun then maybe like two hours of no fun I think the pain issue is that there's a lot of pain involved on so many levels again I'll see you tomorrow for day three. I just want this shit to be over low-key billing also having a good time Am I having a good time So we just got coffee no cat today, all right day 13 Okay, even though I don't really have any artists I care to see you today Sometimes just like I don't even really want to go I got a collage not because I love when coffee makes me freak the fuck out. Oh It actually is good. Normally when I go to a random coffee place like this shit. It's just bad anyway So we're gonna go give our friends to coffee if they're ready and then we're gonna fucking go to the festival day three oh, we're just all a mess at this point like Why am I filming myself doing this vegetarian sausage I know what you're doing taking video of a stop. We're breaking up We all just made a crazy no cap executive decision to not go to day three We're literally just gonna hang out all day at the pool. We're just gonna chill by the pool. Oh My god, it's freezing. Never mind. Honestly, it just wasn't the vibe today. Oh, oh, it's all melted Oh how you're not as good when it's melted We're having a beach day You know what? The thing about Coachella is it's only fun when? You want to see music that you like and then maybe you don't have like songs that you want to see you're artists that you Want to see it's just pointless and also like look at Josie's blisters Like there's no way she could walk around a whole another day. Yeah, there's no reason to torture ourselves for a whole nother day I just don't have it in me, but it was a great time when we were there We took Polaroids we have coffee. Oh That's really some strong shit also like it's so beautiful out here like come on Who could resist this view? It's my vegan pizza with so many olives on it that nobody would like to eat it But me welcome to vegan pizza my thing. I thought I would do a quick Coachella review. Oh you got garlic knots Mm-hmm last year I said that it was the worst weekend of my life this year It wasn't the worst weekend of my life But it definitely was a little bit of a mess getting to and from the festival every day a mess The zubur situation was a mess. The coffee was good. The music was good for the time that we were there. It was great Well, it was pretty good better than last year I also think I drank more coffee than they did last year, which means it was a good time Am I gonna go back next year? Yeah I know I'm good. Now that burped No, not so that was fun the lesson I learned is to your food I have a bad habit of not you remember fries At the festival no because there's so many loud people being moved in here Wait, you're awesome. I would argue that garlic knots that you can get from a pizza place are actually better than the pizza. Mm-hmm Welcome to vlogmas"

It's Sunday April seventh and I have five days until I leave for Coachella And yeah theres a lot to do This shit is a big fucking deal to me I don't know why I'm kind of embarrassed about how much I care about it But at least I'm like self-aware and I know that it's stupid that I care this much about it So it's like fine right? I don't know All I've really done thus far to prepare, is pick out outfits Which I have been doing for the past few months And I have spread sheets and powerpoints for each outfit And I have a whole section in my closet dedicated to my Coachella outfits I think this is like a coping mechanism for me It's something to look forward to and it's a fun activity I mean you can say what you want about it but at least I'm having a good time The final days of prep start today Five days left. The prep for Coachella is so intense Very similar to preparing for like a pageant, or like a fashion show Like that's what it is Coachella prep starts now, I can't believe it came around this quick I remember when it was last year's Coachella and now it's like this years? This shit's crazy. This shit goes crazy and stupid. Go crazy *aenh* go stupid *aehh* you know? Let's just f*ckin get started first and most important step of coachella prep is tanning every outfit looks good with a tan and that's the f*ckin end of story. i hate *phone rings* who the f*ck only problem is that I hate tanning it's one of my least favorite activities that exist so i'll probably end up just getting a spray tan i always try to tan, but do i succeed? never. i've never like gotten a good tan. but i can try. i'm very uncomfortable right now another thing i do though, that speeds up the tanning process so i don't have to be outside as long is put olive oil on my body. is that unhealthy? probably. nobody has told me that its bad but then again nobody's told me that it's good. don't try this at home because i don't want to go to jail, oh my god oh my god ohmygod olive oil's a mess supposedly being in the sun a few minutes a day helps with acne which we all know is a reoccurring issue for me ohmygod my literal boobs are falling out this video is gonna not get monetized ohmygod i literally have a pool of olive oil in my belly button so that's worrisome ugh this is so boring but i know its gonna be worth it like if i had a killer tan at coachella i mean ooh the way i just said that made me upset im so bored so bored AEHHHH i definitely just don't like the feeling of being oily and right now i'm really f*ckin oily and... wow i really wish i had music to listen to right now i don't have a speaker. only cool kids have speakers, i've never owned like a speaker you know what, that's on my bucket list, is getting a portable speaker so that i can be that kid that walks around the party, i don't really go to parties, but walks around the party with a portable speaker and just makes everyone's day improved because they're playing mo bamba on the speaker and everyone just goes frickin wild i want that to be me i always try to take a nap in the sun but it never works, maybe i'll try for a second right now SNIFF okay that didn't last very long *cool music* OHH YEAUHHH okay so let me tell you something a big struggle that - i think everyone has - when planning coachella outfits is that they want to have a unique outfit. they wanna stand out, they wanna be different they wanna have something that nobody else has - and that's really hard to do when you're buying stuff from stores because - anyone can buy it ... sO i had the idea that this year i would... (get ready for it) DIY a few things. i dont know how i came up with this idea, but all i have to say is that I LOVE it. for one outfit I wanna paint on jean shorts and an old pair of air force ones because I felt like that would be. really epic and it would really set me apart because the thing is is that no one else is gonna have this that makes me #special why is my apartment so hot are you sweaty? Amanda: I've been telling you for three days your apartments so hot what are we gonna do about it? *phone rings* leAvE mE aLoNe I'm gonna be painting- -using white paint and lime green paint because the top that I'm wearing is lime green but im not gonna show you the full outfit because im posting this video before I go to Coachella and I don't wanna spoil my full outfit *terrifying animal growl* *obnoxious sounds* I have no idea what direction I'm going with this *obnoxious paint bottle squeeze* what do we paint first? pants?? shoes?? pants?? *utter confusion* the sh- pants wait up what the f*ck the shoes the pants I don't f*cking know lets talk about Coachella outfits last year my outfits were- - you know what I'm not gonna be mean to myself because I did my best I just didn't really hit the mark at the time it was good but now looking back I'm just like well that was something to be embarassed of but this year I'm trying to redeem myself amandas actually over there literally custom making a hat how's your custom hat going? its gonna feel so personal like when I walk around at Coachella wearing this shit im gonna be like I f*cking made it made all of it I sewed the shoes myself I will tell them that its not true but I will tell them that you know sometimes you need to white lie every once in a while there's nothing wrong with a little bit of lying lying is super good wooaaaoww so far so f*cking good bitch this is kinda boring though like its funny because my dads an artist and like I should enjoy this type of stuff but to be quite honest like I'm already bored and its been about seven minutes can you believe how much effort we put in took three days I just can't believe that I do that dude I was blonde last year at Coachella can we talk about that who was she scared of her did you ever know blonde Emma? Amanda: no good now I'm thinking about it like if I diy more clothes I'd really step up my game in life lime green stripe is done on both shoes lets do a little montage do you like this? I know its hot that's why I did it *cue funky electronic music* okay this is already kinda looking scary *GuLp* *continues with groovy music* okay guys first little section is done *cheers* so do you know what wait I just touched wet paint im gonna work on all of this I'll check in with you when I'm done then we'll see how it went DiY sEsSiOn its been like three hours and im done but it'll be worth it when I show up looking like a bad bitch right? I don't wanna reveal too much because no one has seen this yet and the whole point is that its supposed to be a suprise sooo these are the shoes that's all you get to see thank you let me show you the shorts boom -b that's it amandas over here rhinestoning her hat I'll just give a little sneak peak this is amandas hat that she's rhinestoning how do you feel? she's literally been rhinestoning this hat for three hours are you okay? im not even close you know me once I start something im not finishing so what if I went to bed and just made you continue doing this I would hurt you physically *Groovy music* its Monday happy Coachella Monday hate that happy monday for coachella Wow This week I'm focusing a lot on my health :) Coachella's something wherre You wanna be feeling your absolute best

-emma chamberlain",2019-03-28T18:57:44Z,452683,11071608,20656,"the video i have to film today is making me already upset and it's only 10 AM Good morning sorry I am fucking exhausted It's 10 AM and that""s sometimes early for me so I'm not having the best time Today -music plays- I'm putting my phone in a box For the whole day. My parents gave me this idea.  They're like, Emma you are so addicted to your phone. you just can't focus on anything for more than three seconds it's really a problem you need to go without your phone for a day and I was like, that like wouldn't be that hard and in comparison to most people I know, I am better with my phone then them maybe i'm just in denial I'm not really that addicted to going on my phone I mean I like to ... I mean, I like going on my phone. I don't really like have an emotional dependency on it but then again, we'll see so I'm putting it in this box for the rest of the day so this phone is staying in the box I don't get to use any of the benefits of this phone for the next 24 hours. I can't go on social media, I can't use the timer if I want to post mate something can't use that that is gonna be upsetting I can't look at the time which is actually this one's okay because I bought this vintage watch though my mom set it up for me because she's visiting and I had no idea how to set it up and my friend Amanda and my mom were like Emma's never gonna wear that watch. Guess. What bitch? how the fuck you put on the watch, oh Look at me and my fucking watch bitch now, let me tell you the scientific aspect of this video I want to see how I react I want to see if it upsets me OR I want to see if it makes me more level-headed and clear-headed but the other thing The other thing that we're gonna observe is to see people's reactions that don't know that I put my phone away for 24 hours are people going to think that I'm literally dead Because I didn't post a snapchat? We'll see but I feel like people will be like worried about me which would be nice But if no one worries about me, I'm only gonna be a little bit offended. Thank God I'm already with my friend Amanda because I don't have to worry about getting in contact with her somehow which would be like so traumatic So let's get started with the day. All right it's currently 11:16 first thing I've noticed just from being without my phone. I do feel like I've had a really relaxing morning I didn't open my phone and then go on Twitter and see like a bunch of negative shit like it was nice wa- *interrupted by the coffee machine* Why did this happen every time? I'm gonna wait for it to stop The only thing that I noticed that was negative about me not having my phone at all this morning It's been hard for me to like keep my mind on track Like I was about to get dressed but I like kept forgetting I was gonna do like seven times No, I'm starting to think you're just stupid *burps* Honestly today I'm gonna be the happiest day of my- *interrupted by the coffee machine again* Vlogging is dangerous Why is vlogging dangerous? because I slam my shoulder into the corner on you elbow computer I've done a lot more damage with vlogging than just physical damage it's been few minutes and I'm obviously drinking this coffee and it's making my bowel start to move right? i'm bowel is moving alright, I was about to go sit on the toilet and I just looked for my phone for 10 minutes so that I'd have on toilet entertainment come to find out so I'll dance for you while you're on the toilet We have about 30 minutes until we have to leave to SoulCycle and I have nothing to do like this is normally time when I'd be Going on my phone. I'm bored. And I literally have the urgency to look at a book So I guess that we can go pick out a book from upstairs and read it. I'd like a look at it I have some picture books like I don't know what's going on with me. My god, I just learned that poop is made out of 70% water 10% indigestible food That's the corn we've all been seeing 10% dead bacteria and then 10% fat salts live bacteria dead cells and mucus and mucus. Damn. I'm learning some stuff wait what. women are more likely to scrunch their toilet paper and men tend to fold. I always fall does that mean we're men? Oh, my god rats can survive going down the toilet Romans used water soaked sponges on the ends of this in this Romans used water soaked sponges on the ends of sticks and sensual paper. That actually sounds convenient and a lot more environmentally friendly so I'm kind down to try it King George the second died falling on from a toilet. How do you do that? ooooh Okay, I'm looking at a poop diagram to figure out what type of foods I normally have Oh I like to see that actually Type one is like balls of overcooked sausage Okay that is disgusting! you cannot Type two of poop is like lumpy sausage That's okay the shape of your poop depends on the time. It was spit in your colon. Oh, wait maybe we need to start reading more I'm sick reading books So we're just gonna have a dance party and I'm gonna put other music overtop of it so that you don't know what I was listening to you because I don't any copyrighted because that shit stresses me out. Is it triggering you that I'm holding my phone No! ok cool Well maybe We're about to go into SoulCycle we just got here. I just wanted to give you a quick update It's just weird not having my phone like right in front of my face as I drive telling me where to go and shit That's another issue that I realize is gonna arise. I don't have maps! So like how the fuck am I supposed to get anywhere confusing? I mean we could always cheating using Amanda's phone for maps but like I don't have my phone to use maps more than anything It's like showing me, this is about to be super fucking corny, it's showing me how much it helps me with shit. I tells me where to go It plays my music. You might have to play the radio at some point today when I don't know that's worrisome for me I don't want to think about that. I don't like the radio cause I like indie music My watch is looking hella fine tho So like the watch that came for free in happy meals Please Google happy meal watch. I can't I can't google anything, I don't have my fucking phone. Thank God for watches like I can't believe whoever created those super woke because like This shit is helping me is helping as fuck. Like, literally when I'm like OH WHAT TIME IT IS? You could  just also look at your microwave But like Happy meal! Okay, I'm excited for SoulCycle right now because I know that I'm not even gonna have to think about my phone soul cycles like my daily phone cleanse anyways and today I don't even have my phone Anyways, I've just arrived in SoulCycle and I'm ready to get fit and happy Let's get it Okay, bye are you vlogging while on the toilet? So like it was great the past hour that I was this whole cycle I wasn't really affected by the fact that I didn't have my fun because I was doing an activity that didn't require my phone So we'll see how the day goes from here I'm gonna have to put Amanda on aux because I don't have my phone and I don't want to play the radio So hopefully she plays something good. I play Nickelback one time and all the sudden things are going good as of now I felt really clear-minded today to be completely honest and corny my heart rate even though I just worked out it""s probably at an all-time low but in a good way   I already feel like this experience has changed my life. I feel like a new woman. I don't know you need to try this It sounds stupid. It sounds so cliche, but I just like do feel like really in touch with myself. I was listening to a song and I got choked up a little bit for no reason I feel like going on your phone is kind of like a distraction from your emotions in a way I literally like was forced to just think about stuff and I like got choked up in like a good way But then I didn't cry cause I'm not a fucking pussy but I'm also on my period Why am I always on my period? I'm worried. But anyway, I genuinely got choked up because I was feeling like connected to myself. I'm becoming like a hippie, bro I'm even wearing a fucking watch I already know it sound effect. I'm going to use and I know what the sound effect is called its called Arena crowd cheer I use that one sometimes too! I'm in the car again. I took a nap on accident I think that I napped because I just didn't know what else to do with my body because I was so bored that I didn't have my phone. Now Amanda and I are going to Urban Outfitters because she has something to return and I am a fucking slut for urban outfitters any day of the week. I kind of beenlike dreading having to turn my phone back on I feel like just thinking about it gives me anxiety, but I've also already become so out of the loop like literally I have no idea what anyone's fucking doing what's everyone doing? Like what's everyone up to today? Like I have no idea is the gas really a dollar right now. That's not possible. Oh where do you see a dollar? That's a four. Oh There's my credit card so you always do that, I know I can't wait for the day where you forget to blur it I'm so sad about that day kind of fun kinda freaky kinda fresh kinda funky kinda weird kinda cool kind Of freaky kinda fresh kinda funky kinda weird kinda cool kinda freaky kinda fresh kinda funky funky Monkey Chuncky monkey Benin Jerri Larry where we gonna go baby time to pump that gas ladies can get moving and time to get that booty booty That was bars.

Hey guys, so I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial if any y'all first Just got your license recently first just now got it. I can teach you how to get gas. Yeah, and it's not that horrible I know it can be intimidating so don't get too scared I'm at Hawaii. I'm in Hawaii Hi, welcome to the fucking islands. Oh Oh my god. Why did I do that. Yep, I need that We're struggling because we don't know what to do what we're doing right now is we're just driving up and down streets and just like saying hi to people as we drive by we Just don't know what to do because I don't have my phone I can't go home and then just sit there and do nothing and me and Amanda don't do drugs Which is I feel like what most people do when they're bored. This thing about like not having your phone is that you need to get Creative to figure out stuff to do don't get me wrong. Still having a great day It's just that like it's hard to stay occupied as much Because I can't just go to instagram and scroll for an hour Which is what I normally do when I'm bored What do people do for fun? Literally what do people Do we need to buy a megaphone let's drive to fucking Mexico. DOWN! I wanna get a tan. I am bored Okay. Alright We're not going to Mexico. I know. Okay, so funny story I actually bled through the pants I was wearing earlier. I don't want to talk about it. So I had to go home and change and then after that we realized that we were fucking starving Thank you So then, thank you Now we're at dinner. I'm Realizing that me waiting for the waiter to come take our order has been one of the most boring encounters of my life once I'm eating I'll be fine but like Let me give a little dinner without a phone review me and Amanda and our friend Lindsay just went to dinner It was amazing because we just talked about life the whole time. We had no distractions I know he's just great. I feel really good. I feel like an awakened woman. It's good shit, bro It's fucking good shit. Now me and Amanda. What so you want to do? Absolutely anything except for go home. my thoughts exactly All of it the flow I'll be throwing the ones yeah, I've been way too weird lately. Dude no, you're not weird. Just being yourself. I love it Me and Amanda have been having this issue at night where everybody else in LA goes out and goes to parties and we're not invited number one. And number two. We don't want to go anyway. So instead we just don't know what to do Like we don't know how to do at night when we get really bored. So recently we've just been driving at night We just drive around and be fucking creepy So I think that's what we're gonna do now, What do you say. Down Down Down Down. I LOVE LAAAAAAAAAAAA I LOVE LAAAAAAAAAAA Never thought I would ever need to use this. I'm gonna call my parents in the house phone. Welcome to operator assistance for directory. Why do i not know how to use a house phone. I'm just laying on my heating pad like just chillin or whatever and  I'm gonna do an accurate representation of literal thing that just happened Laughs* I can't even do it giggling** wait wheres my phone?! wheres my phone?! as if i've had it at any point today. like what was i even gonna do on it? is that chocolate on your face? No, it's- i fucking scratched my zit and then it started bleeding on my lip and then i started Licking it like *licks* EWWW *dabs* that was the worst thing i've ever seen. is it delusional hour? yeah, ok but where's my phone. Ok, are you gonna stop it. okay you can stop it baeeee stop. no wait bae no wait bae wait You just look possessed. that like cracked every vertebrae in my back when i did that. BAE give her her phone back.. WHATS SO BAD ABOUT ME WITHOUT MY PHONE why does the blue light make us look ugly? It's literally 4:00 in the morning. I've been watching Hulu series for the past like 4 hours Why is it 4 am like who let that happen? Can I go to bed now? And tomorrow will open my phone. I had a really good day. I mean good vibes I definitely had a few moments where I missed having my phone like, you know, whatever and overall I think the positives outweighed the net Okay byE Good morning, it's time to open my phone up I just like to give a little moment for the great day that I had yesterday. It's a great day I felt very relaxed, but I don't want to give a fuck because I need to post a fucking snapchat story right now Omg i already got distracted and started going on my phone didn't remember that i was filming. Okay, I mean just start putting my phone in a box minimum once a week because already bringing it out I'm fucking like addicted to it as well. Like I can't stop all of my work yesterday of having my phone in the box Just went to shit now that it's out of the box or whatever Literally, like I'm reading through my texts and like all my friends are just like are you alive? I'm so tired. Then literally shut about this Marine was like, thank you guys for watching. I love you guys Go put your phone down for a day. You won't regret it. Alright, I love you guys You're the best and I'll see you soon. BYE!"

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-03-10T19:57:54Z,528601,14222038,23915,"Good morning. Oh my god. I look stupid *intro* It's really early. I'm warning you, the beginning of this vlog, I'm going to be boring because I'm f*cking tired. Let's make a coffee and discuss what's going on today because it's pretty epic so hold on- You know what? I don't even want to wear this beanie. F**k the beanie, the beanie's not happening. In about half an hour, I have a car coming pick me up and I'm going to the airport. Then, I'm gonna sit on a plane for 11 hours. And then, once I land the plane, I'm gonna be in Paris. ""You landed the plane? Are you a pilot?"" ""Oohh"" *fart noise* I've never been to Paris. I've only been to Europe one time. I went to Europe to go to Ireland when I was like 10 but I don't really remember the trip and every time I see a picture from the trip, it makes me nauseous. So, yeah. Growing up, I always wanted to go to Paris. It just never happened. I didn't think I'd ever do anything even remotely like this in my whole life. I'm going to Paris for Fashion Week. Yeah, I'm shocked too. I love clothes even though I dress lazy like 90% of the time, I still really love clothes, so going to Paris Fashion Week is gonna be so dope. I'm actually being sent BY LOUIS VUITTON This sounds like it's a joke. Once I drink my coffee and close my suitcase---which is exploding I literally am gonna have the hardest time of my entire life closing my suitcase right now, but---once my suitcases is closed, my coffee is consumed, we're off to the airport. I'm really excited to go but I'm also like: What am I gonna do on the plane for 11 hours? Hopefully, I can fall asleep. Yummy! Oh my god, you know what I'm excited to try in Paris? Coffee Oh! Also, if you're wondering why I look like... Yesterday, I got a spray tan and I got my nails did. These are the most boring nails I've ever gotten done to my whole life. But I just wanted to be really classy for this trip because I want to prove myself, as a woman, you know? Although I'm somebody that definitely is not afraid to like be really comfortable all the time, I also kind of love being a little bit of a girly girl sometimes. I don't know. Doing stuff like getting my nails done and getting a spray tan to me is slightly too enjoyable. Doing that all the time for me just isn't efficient. So I like to save things like getting my nails done and getting spray tans for special occasions because Girl, I'm busy. *slurps coffee* Let's go to Paris. Okay, I'm gonna go to bed. See you guys in Paris, I guess. We just landed. It's 8 a.m. I slept like the whole time but we'll talk about this later. Also my skin is f***ed up so... I'm so tired. I'm sorry. Can I order room service? *on-hold music* Vibes. Can I have hard-boiled eggs, fruit plate, granola. Thank you so much. [guy on phone] You're welcome. Ok sorry. I'm in my room I'm... a mess. It's 9 a.m. I can't believe I was literally on a plane for 11 hours. I slept for like eight hours though. And then for the other two hours, I watched beautiful boy and cried, so that was a good accomplishment for me. My room is pretty crazy. This place is super nice. Let me show you, I'll give you a little room tour. When you walk in, you walk in right here, and then you have this mirror. Hi, that's me. Here's the bathroom. I actually haven't looked at the bathroom yet. Oh my god. How does this work? What? Okay, that's how that works. I just spray tanned so ignore that. Shower in here. Oh my god, ow. Toilet. Let me see, is the French toilet the same as American toilet? Oh, woah. Uh, there's me again, and there's me again. There's a lot of mirrors in this place. This is seriously beautiful like... This is my view from my hotel room and then I have my bed. That's the room tour! Even though I slept for so long on the plane, I'm still like so drained. I'm so tired Oh my god, oh my god. This is my first meal in Paris. Okay, this latte has a f***ing bird on it. I love this place. Oh my god, the coffee here's... f**k ahh Oh, wait. I need to take an Instagram picture of this first. I have to. Okay, now that I've been a basic bitch and took a picture of it, let's feast. What did I even order again? Oh, yeah, I ordered hard-boiled eggs. That's gonna be interesting. First, let's eat my granola.   Oh my god, why is it so good? *coughing* Is this Kiwi? *gasps* Kiwi? I'm eating like a pig. F**k it, I'll even eat the mint too. Why is the mint really good? Oh my god, oh my goddd. Sorry. Me and my snacks. It's healthy. I just went to the gym and then I showered, which I didn't film because guess what? Vlogging boring stuff is stupid. So I just ordered my second coffee of the day. It just came up. What's really cool is that this coffee is iced but there's no actual ice in it. So don't ask me the science behind that because I couldn't tell you but *slurps* tastes good. I am going to, I think, a Louis Vuitton store? I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know. So that's what I'm getting ready for right now. It's so funny because---this is kind of off topic but---when I was in the gym, all of the gym equipment was in French so I didn't know what anything meant and like there's another American guy in the gym and he looked confused too. There's no way I'm the only one that's having this issue. And then I get into the shower. No f***ing idea how to use that shower. I still don't know how I turned it on. It was so confusing. Anyway, I guess I should get ready right now. Or maybe I'll just lay in bed with my coffee for the next like hour. I just spilled coffee all over my face. Okay, so I'm at the Louis Vuitton store and I'm about to do a fitting. This is the most I've looked like a woman in like six months. Okay, so this is very cool, but it's just slightly long.   I love this top this top. This top fits so good. It has like shoulder pads in it, which is something I've never experienced. The skirt is too big though, but I like the idea of it because we all know I love plaid. We'll keep you updated on this. We've been trying things on for like probably forty-five minutes, but then they put this outfit on me. It's... It literally made my jet lag go away, that's how good it is. I don't know this does it justice, but it's so cool. Like these shoes are so epic I don't even know what's going on right now. Alright, bye. Peace out. Hi, can I order one iced latte with almond milk? Thank you. Bye. Yeah I'm tired. Also, I am wearing men's underwear, but I literally ordered them myself because I'm not kidding you, the best pajama pants are men's briefs. I'm not kidding. I had a fitting with Louis Vuitton and they got me outfits for a party that I have tonight and then the fashion show that I have on Tuesday. It's kind of been fun being a little bit of a girly girl for the past like 24 hours Also, I need to redo my makeup for this party because I'm starting to look not good. Gonna take a piss now. I don't know how to do my hair for this. I don't know. Maybe I do a half up-half down. Am I making the right decision? Okay, this is cute but like do I want to do this? Is this like the decision I want to make right now? Like I don't know. After my hair crisis, I ended up going to the party, which was actually pretty fun, but I didn't really vlog anything because I got too nervous. [fake crowd] yayyyy! That's okay though because I think that the two photos I took while I was there sum up the whole experience So as you can see here, um, they had many little burgers I didn't eat these because I'm vegetarian, but it was still a really fun gesture I also kicked over one of the candle decorations because I was standing next to it and am a f********** Sorry, everybody. That's not gonna be that fun to clean up, but it's not my fault. Actually it is. Good morning. It's like 6:00 a.m. I woke up at 5:30 because I'm jet-lagged and confused So I just ordered myself breakfast, which I'm so excited about. The breakfast here is... This is my last free day in Paris. We're going to some tourist attractions, which is exciting. We're gonna go to the Eiffel Tower and then tomorrow is the Fashion Show and I am really excited. Okay, but here's the tea. I wanted to do a cycling class really bad. There's a literal cycling class, 8 minute walk away from here, and I want to go really bad. But the thing is I'm like nervous. Like I don't know if it's a good idea. The whole class is gonna be in French. I can't read the website because it's all in French. If I do end up going, I'll bring you guys with me and that can be a fun adventure for us. If not, then well, we'll just all go f**k ourselves so I'm literally trying to book this cycling class and I have to copy and paste into Google Translate to understand what anything means but if I did everything correctly, then that means that I have a class at 7:45. Mmm. I'm eating breakfast and it's still dark out so that's kind of confusing. They made my latte hot today Do you know what? I'm not gonna complain. This is the first time I've ever had a hot coffee not hated it. France is changing me. Oh my god, why is the mint here so good? Should I try one of these jams? Problem is I don't really like Jam that much. This is the best breakfast that exists like the fruit is all so good but then you get like really good eggs--- which, I don't even f***ing like eggs that much. You get granola that's like amazing with almond milk that's like really good almond milk and then you get bread. Like I don't know what else in life I need. They should make a reality show about me in Paris by myself. A.K.A. what's happening right now. They can watch me eat French breakfast and stuff. *slurps* Oh god, this coffee... It's good hot. Since when? I haven't good hot coffee since '99. Okay, so I'm on my way to my class. It's still dark and it's like 7:30 a.m. I'm really confused. Also gonna jaywalk right now cause I'm a f***ing savage. All right. Wish me luck. We'll see how this goes   I just finished. It was actually really good. It was really weird. It was like exactly the same as soul cycle. I didn't expect it to be that similar, but everything was in French so I had no idea what was going on the whole class. I just had to follow what the instructor was doing Anyway, I'm gonna walk back to my hotel room now. Okay. Bye Now it's time for a little bit of a tourist few days. It's our day off. I have to head out. It's Eiffel Tower Hour. Wow *burps* I'm so jet-lagged So I woke up, ate my breakfast, did my cycling class, went and saw the Eiffel Tower, and then I went shopping for like two hours and made mistakes. And then I came home and slept for like five hours. So that was my day today, but I thought I'd do a haul. I'm literally screaming. I'm so delirious. I'm like---I seem like I'm on drugs, but I'm not, shockingly. I'm also gonna make this a try on haul even though I really don't want to. I guess I'll do it for you. *blows kiss* aww First thing I got---so f***ing cute. It's this big yellow raincoat from the brand uhhh... hmm Schultze, and it's so cute. I love it. I feel like it's something I would have worn in like third grade and I'm obsessed with it. So I love that. Okay, this is kind of a questionable item. Not really but I got these Carhartt overalls. You know, I don't know, overalls, I bought a pair recently and I really uhh liked them so we'll see if the Carhartt ones end up being cute. Next, I got these freakin French ass jeans. These are French as hell. They fit so well. They kind of give me a nice little 80s vibe. Really f***ing into those pants. I also got these mustard colored jeans just because they fit super well. I feel like they're just like an easy thing to wear around, you know? This detail on the zipper--- see like right here ,like this little detail right here---got me fucked up. There's something about that detail that I love. Count me in. Now, let me show you what I got from Zara.  First, I got this turtleneck. How cute is this? I kinda wanna cut my hair like this girl on the shirt. I just like her look. She looks so swag. Comment down below if I should cut my hair like her or if I should just shut up, instead. Then, I got this---which this is kind of like boring but---it's just a corduroy thing. If I were just like open with a shirt under it,--- obviously a shirt under it, not just f***ing naked under it. I feel like that could be really cute. I don't know I just like it. It was an impulse buy. Okay, next, thank god, is kind of a unique thing for me. I normally don't buy things like this. I really like these. I got these boots. They're really cool. I decided I would branch out and get these and I like them. Fashion week has made me really actually open my mind to new fashion. I normally wouldn't have bought boots like that, but I was like f**k it, they're cool. Oh, then, I got this shirt, which I love. I love this shirt. It's so cool. It looks stupid--- well it doesn't look stupid, but it doesn't look like anything special but it looks so good on and I actually haven't tried it on yet so I don't know if that's even true, but I'm just thinking, I'm just guessing it looks good on so... thank you. Okay. I kinda went off at Zara. Um, whoops, sorry. I don't know. Next, I got this jacket because I've been really enjoying super big winter coats recently, which is stupid because it's literally about to be summer kind of soon. It's a fuzzy material because we all know that I'm a bitch for fuzzy things. Super cute. Next. This last thing I got is f***ing epic. This raincoat. This is like the coolest raincoat I've ever seen. Okay, well, you can't even see it cuz it's see-through, but you'll be able to see when I try it on. This is a try on haul because I'm nice. So that's all I bought. So I'm gonna try all the shit on and then I'm gonna go to bed and then tomorrow is the fashion show. Good night Good night. See you tomorrow for the big day Good morning and Happy Fashion Week Day. My god, my eyebrows look psycho. It's 7:15 a.m. I'm about to go to another French SoulCycle because Why not? I'm done. I'm gonna see if I can find like a cute little café to go into. Wish me luck. It's raining and I bought this raincoat yesterday just for fun cause I thought it was cool and it's like really coming in handy. My mind is so powerful. I had no idea it was gonna rain and I was right. ""Hey guys. Getting ready."" ""She loves it."" ""I love this. No, I actually love it. They're making me glam."" ""I don't do this type of stuff. I have no idea what I look like right now."" ""I asked her what she wanted. She goes: I have no idea"" I don't. I'm so excited. Show them my dress. Sneak peak of the dress. What are we thinking guys? That's one crazy freakin dress. Okay, I'm doing an outfit reveal but I'm blurring my face right now cuz I want the whole thing to be a surprise so you can't see my face right now at all cuz I'm gonna blur it. And then it's--- outfit reveal. Okay, hold on. Okay, three, two, one. What do you think guys? What do we think? I don't even look like me like normally at this angle when I'm filming at this angle I look like like a hard-boiled egg that like you peeled off the shell already and it's just like a little lumpy a little bit like really pale. Now I look like an Easter Egg. I love that. I mean this pattern---this pattern. I want to be buried in this pattern. I look good, at least. See, this is like how mom's on Facebook take selfies like this... Just dropped off my kid at school. Now, I'm gonna go to Pilates and then I'm going to the PTA meeting and then after that I'm making cookies cuz guess what? It'a the baking fundraiser that they have every year and the kids are supposed to bake their own snacks but I'm baking him the sweets for the fundraiser instead because he doesn't like doing things that are difficult. Okay, so now that I'm all done and ready. We don't have the show for a little bit, so we're having a little photo shoot. Oh my god. For fun, for---just for funsies. Oh my god. I don't even look like me. I don't look like me at all. I'm scared. But yeah, we're doing a photo shoot, so I'm just gonna start posing and hoping that I don't look stupid. That's kind of just what I do every day. Oh my god I'm still filming The fact that I got literally two minutes of sleep last night is really catching up to me and my heels are making my feet hurt but that's okay because beauty is pain. We're about to go to the show. Oh my god. Big moment. Who are you filming? I'm so excited and kind of nervous. About to get out of the car. There's a lot of people around. I don't know what any of them are doing though. Oh my god, why are there so many people with cameras and stuff. ""That was so scary but I loved it. But I also had my phone like kind of like not classy. I'm like posing with it. I'm like..."" ""But you match"" I'm feeling really, um, kind of like a badass bitch right now. Ow. My feet hurt. Ow. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. I'm sitting in my spot. I'm so excited to watch the show. I love this. I could do this every weekend. I wish that there was a Fashion Week every weekend and that I was invited to every single one. Well, I'll see you when the show starts. I'm nervous. Kind of nervous, kind of excited. bye."

I don't know really who I was asking cause like no ones in the car besides you. but are you ready [Amanda] Yeah Amanda's ready *cheers and applause* * emma's intro * HOLY F*** Today is a big day. I got a very special DM the other day. It was from a special person, which you already know who it fucking is because you saw the title of the fucking video Oh my god wait can I cuss in this if I'm collabing with her? Me not cussing this whole time is going to be virtually impossible   But I'm going to do it because JoJo Siwa's very family friendly. Oh, I just said her name now too So now you guys know I'm collabing with I got a DM a few days ago from JoJo. I'm a big fan of this girl. Okay, I think she's great. She's a lot of energy. She's just a positive tough girl And so when she DMed me I was like ""it's happening"" Like she's too fun for me to miss out on this opportunity. In today's video I'm turning Jojo into me, which I don't think anyone would want to do My skateboard is making loud sounds in my trunk and I just wanted to bring that up to remind you guys that I am a skater girl. I don't know what else to say about that I'm planning on taking her into Urban Outfitters, picking her out a dope outfit [Amanda] The guy in the car next to you... Hi, oh my fucking god, what do I do? Is he still looking? [Amanda] Oh my god, he's looking he's looking he's looking You watching me? Why you watching me? [Man] Cause it's Sunday! Cause it's Sunday? Day of the Lord. Have a good one. Okay, that was... - Really uncomfortable.
- [Amanda] So uncomfortable. I'm driving to JoJo's house right now And I think it's gonna be fucking lit Sorry. No cussing, I think it's gonna be flipping lit bro You know what's gonna be more important is me not cussing in her video. Alright JoJo see you soon. Turn the camera off Oh my [Emma] Is this your car? No this is not my car I just have my face on it. - Okay because you're fifteen--
- Yes Well, you have to have someone 25 in the driver's seat, right? In the passenger seat. Oh my god, ""in the driver's seat?"" Okay, I need help. So I guess we should take my car but let's just do a quick montage of your car so that people know how dope it is And then you guys can just imagine that we're driving in her car? - Perfect. Love that. Sounds great.
-Okay, deal, deal. So, where are we going? You tell me. Okay you're right, where do I shop every day? Urban Outfitters. I've-- been to Urban Outfitters twice in my life but I never bought anything there. Okay. Well today's the day. I'm gonna pick you out a very classic ""Emma"" outfit. We'll see what they got. We'll see what we're feeling. I'm gonna pick out a JoJo bow that matches the outfit so that she can still have her bow because you know You gotta hold on to who you are. Sorry, that's my skateboard in the trunk. Do you skateboard? Barely I pennyboard and I think I'm really cool when I like ride in my garage like once a month. - We're really similar.
- We are. Let's discuss how we are similar. - So ponytail for sure.
- Definitely. I mean look at us. We both have a tight ponytail There's a little bit of differences. Mine's a little bit more slicked back yours is just kinda there.( oof) We both like caffeine but we both find it different places. What's your caffeine source? Diet Coke and sugar. I love sugar. For me: coffee, which I think I might have to get you a coffee at some point today. I am becoming you. I need to be you. That's so true. I need to go to SoulCycle. Ohh yes I do. I literally went this morning that's why when I showed up at your house my hair was like all gross and soggy. You told me you showered!! Dude I did, I did right after but-- Maybe I didn't. Ahh. No I did. Emma showered. Yeah, I've been doing SoulCycle recently. It's honestly-- Is it fun? I've never been. Will you take me? YES. Everyone's like super competitive about it But it like weirdly makes it the best workout ever because everyone's being so competitive and the next thing you know You're just like going super fast. You start sweating and then you start crying and I've cried once Aww Not because it hurt but because they like--the whole reason why it's like ""soul"" cycle is They're like, ""okay like so gotta remember that like, you know life is like really short and that you gotta make it worth it"" and stuff And then you're like ""oh my god, like you're right"" We're gonna die. I'm a really good driver you'd be surprised like the types of talents I have in the car. I might be a little bit crazy, you know, like I might have to take some risks. If you don't take risks like you never have fun. It's so crazy that we are literally a year and a half apart. - We're a year and a half apart?
- Yeah. You know when I was 15, I was so different than I am now like I've changed A LOT. What were you like? Uhhh *cringe intensifies* Not goo--I didn't-- Okay so I parked like an idiot and now I have to pull up so like that's my life right now. [Amanda] There ya gooo. Let's do it. Let's do it. - [Emma] Where is it? 
- [Amanda] It's right there. [Emma] Oh. Hi, I'm stupid. (upbeat piano music) Going to Urban Outfitters. Going to Urban Outfitters. [Amanda] Ohh she's so good! Shall we? [Emma] She already found something she likes. She likes this store, she's already me. (chill hip hop music) This place is fun! Yooo this is fun! This place is sick! I actually want this for me. [Amanda] You're not dressing you. We're dressing her. Stay on track. Ohh what about this?!? This is cute. (chill hip hop music) This is fuzzy! I would actually wear this. We'll hold this for now. This might come in handy later unless I can find something fuzzy that's up to my standards. But until then, let's keep looking. (chill hip hop music) This is actually really cute. I'm coming back here later today Isn't this so great? It's fun! Oh wait I actually have these pants. (chill hip hop music) Hey Emma, say that you like slides because those are JoJo's favorite. You know what shoes I really--I really love slides. I-- So I need to find a white long-sleeve. Imma use one of these (chill hip hop music) What I'm thinking is this, with this under it, up into this and then I feel like that's a pretty ""Emma"" outfit. I've been really loving layering T-shirts over long sleeves recently. Doesn't look like a vibe yet but it's gonna be a freaking vibe. I almost said the F word. These options are making me borderline upset. (chill hip hop music) I feel pretty good about the outfit I picked out. [Amanda] How are you feeling about this? Terrified, but it's better than I thought it was going to be. I was not excited come in here cause I was like ""not my style, not my store."" But after experiencing the store, I like it. [Emma] It's fun. It's vibes. I can tell JoJo's a little nervous about this outfit. I don't blame her. I think she's gonna look awesome. I think she's gonna look really great. The only thing is we didn't really get her shoes, so she might have to wear my dirty Air Force One's. I don't think she'll be down for that. - She might get foot fungus.
- [Amanda] She won't fit. She's also might get foot fungus. What? Huh? Before I can get her changed we have a few missing pieces, we're gonna pick her out a bow We're gonna pick her out shoes, we're gonna pick her out glasses Perfect. Because we need to get some accessories that Urban Outfitters didn't have and I think that she probably has something like it in her closet because her closet is very large and extensive. Let's go. I already know my way around JoJo's house y'all. [JoJo] It's great! [Emma] Oh okay wow. I like this. I like--I like these. So these in all white would be kind of similar to my Air Force Ones But, I also wear Doc Martens a lot, and I know you said you have some. I have plain black, rainbow sparkles, pink sparkles or white with rhinestones. You have plain black? - Yes.
- Let's get those out. [Emma] Okay let's see...Okay this one actually might work guys. - I think this one might be it.
- [JoJo] I'm down. Give us a countdown when you're ready. We'll be waiting on the couch. All right, let's come over to the Jojo couch. I'm really excited because, you know, JoJo, she is so awesome, she has great energy and I want to see her in a more ""Emma"" outfit because my energy is a lot more: And her's is a lot more: you know what I mean? I'm just so excited to see her in my outfit. Can't even breathe right now. Jojo, I'm kidnapping your dog. Look how cute--this thing loves me. Oh my god. So funny story about this little puppy. First time me and JoJo really talked was on Twitter. She tweeted at me and she said ""BowBow Chamberlain."" Insert tweet right here. My neck hurts. I was super honored that she dressed up her dog as me and that was when I knew that life was gonna--it was gonna be good here on out. JoJo's putting on shoes right now, final touches. I am... Nervous sweating. Aye, what's up? You ready? Are you almost ready? (circus music) [Amanda] One, two, three. OH MY GOD!! SO GOOD!! YESS!! (circus music) [Emma] She is-- me She is ME. This is so good. You're literally like a three inch taller version of me. YES. I FEEL AWESOME. IT'S SO FUN. [Emma] Yeah, right? YEAH IT'S GREAT!! I feel like I am--- fifteen. I feel so different because I feel like all people are like ""you are not--"" to me like ""you are not what 15-year-olds should look like."" [Emma] Right. But then I'm like, ""okay, but what should a 15-year-old look like if you're saying I'm not."" I think that I look great how I look. - I love doing what I do.
- [Emma] You look great. 100% But then I'm like, ""I don't like seeing people who, you know, are like being appropriate at age 15."" [Emma] Right. But like this is a good look for a 15-year-old. [Emma] Totally! If they don't like pink and sparkles, you know. [Emma] Totally! I like pink and sparkles. But this is like a good older kid look that's not inappropriate, that's clean and I like it! I love it. You look great in both. [Amanda] You gotta teach her your footwork. All right guys so this is my footwork. Oh my god! Okay what about, wait..spice it up. I don't even know how to do this. [JoJo] Okay, okay! She's literally better at all my dance moves than me. I feel like really threatened. Whenever I hear you or think of you all I can think of is the moment in David's vlog forever ago when you go: ""SCRUNCHIES!!!!"" One more thing before we end this video: we have a Postmate coming to the door... (cheery music) [JoJo] COFFEE!! This is my go-to drink when I'm not drinking iced almond milk lattes. This is espresso, oat milk-- Never had that. You will probably like it. It's really good. And then vanilla on the bottom. - So take a straw...
- Okay.. And then you just mix it. (crickets) What's it taste like? - [Amanda] It's really good. It's like creamy milkshake. 
- [Emma] It's sweet. It's like a milkshake. So it still has the taste of coffee in it. A little bit. - [Emma] Are you ready?
 - [JoJo] Okay. Yes, I'm ready. [Emma] You got this. Come on. [Emma] She's nervous! It's not Diet Coke, she doesn't know what to do. It got like stuck in my throat. (drumroll) It's good, it tastes like hand sanitizer. It's good... - [JoJo] ...when you first drink it. 
 - Yeah. It's smooth. Now my mouth literally feels like I just took some hand sanitizer, washed my hands, and went: and licked my hand. I'll give it, out of a ten... I'm not gonna be offended. I didn't make it. I'll give it a seven. Respect. That's pretty good. Did you have fun? I had a blast. Sorry, I'm just admiring your coffee now. I mean, who wouldn't. Okay well, if you want to see me dress up as her, go on her channel. Check it out. It's gonna be fun. There'll be a link down below too, probably. If I remember to do that. You'll forget. She knows. It's funny how you feel as someone else. Like I feel different. Like I feel like I wanna like go to the mall. Me! If American Apparel was still a thing, I'd be at American Apparel. Like I wanna go in Abercrombie & Fitch and like admire the men on the wall. Oh my god! She looks better than me, she dances better than me, she even drinks coffee better than me. BYE GUY-- Oh wait I wasn't doing it. BYE GUYS!! Is that a nacho cheese machine? [JoJo] Yes. Oh my god, if dairy didn't give me diarrhea, you know I would eat that right now. (outro music)"

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-02-20T20:57:42Z,373620,7738129,23811,[Music] okay sorry it's kind of early in the morning so I kind of seemed a little bit I don't really think that works let me just get out of my garage and then we can talk but kind of busy right now so it's [ __ ] crazy let me know my teeth look straighter than usual I'm asking because they wore my retainer for the first time in six months last night and I just want to know if it did anything and if it did then I'll keep wearing it but if it didn't then five years racist prison asking what's up left turn illegally right now so let's just get that over with then we can start oh my god I'm gonna get [ __ ] killed holy [ __ ] that was scary alright I just got honked at I've not filmed in my car in a long time I literally just don't do this anymore I just kind of forgot about this and I don't want to neglect it because I think it's a great way for me to word vomit and then have some form of content out of it I decided today I'd take you on one of my little morning coffee runs today I'm by myself I'm gonna get some coffee okay crazy talk about some [ __ ] maybe not even fun but I just kind of want to talk about it why do I sound like I'm like reporting you to the principal's office to talk about your behavior at lunch when you told Sally that she looked like a honey badger not cool I've been trying to do a lot of self growth recently you know it's never too late to do that ever do a lot of that recently but that means that I've been talking to my friends about it a lot and they're probably getting sick of it so like are you guys sick of me talking about myself all the time or what oh my god well I'm not gonna bore you with all the things I'm trying to do to make myself grow as a human being cuz that's just not what my channel is actually maybe you do want to know okay I'll give you the benefit of the doubt so I'll just tell you a few the things that I'm doing I've been trying to wear nice outfits when I go out like instead of just wearing sweats and stuff which today I'm literally wearing sweats so can't really do that Alexander like when I go out I want to look at least better than usual today I straighten my hair because it was in a bun and it was super like gross and like if my hair my buck like when I put my hair in a ponytail literally like this just rate my hair and that made me look a little bit better another thing I've been trying to go to workout classes so far I've only done one SoulCycle I just wanted to give an update that I've actually been doing super well with this and I've actually done two more since I filmed this video so found applause for me or whatever yeah actually oh my god thanks guys but I mean like it felt really good afterwards I want to do another one it's just when I get stressed out because if you have ever been to Seoul sailors cycling when you get there you have to like get your bike set up and I don't know how to set up my bike so like that's really preventing me from like going again cuz I'm so anxious about asking them to set up my bike hopefully I make it into another SoulCycle but and you did pitch I hated that say something another thing is I try to leave my apartment a lot more I'm trying to be hald the least amount as possible because blebbing my apartment it's dark in there it's dreary in there and that's about it another thing you know I've been living in LA for like eight months or something it's weird because actually a year ago like today literally I was actually in LA visiting and I wasn't living here yet I wasn't in thinking about living here yet but visiting a year ago and it's so weird because when I was visiting here I remember I went to like all these different coffee shops and I when I bought clothes in all these places but it's weird out now that I live here like all those old memories now I'd like their place on a mental map for me words before I was visiting I didn't know [ __ ] about LA I had no idea where I was it's so weird out like I've been living here and now I like know it so well I can like get places without using a map now that's next level for me I never can do that [ __ ] what's my point of all this umm oh my god that girl was walking with a selfie stick I was weird anyway she might be vlogging so it's just weird being a tourist at a place and then like a few months later living there you know I'm like I only moved here eight months ago my whole mindset on everything changed but that's so awesome that is so good like I wouldn't want to [ __ ] be the same person forever and never get cooler and stuff I want to get cooler and stuff this whole vlog so far has been all a lot of deep stuff not even like deep like semi deep like basically as deep as like my mind goes but now we should just talk about stupid [ __ ] there's a little bit less baggage when you talk about just stupid [ __ ] let me talk about an issue I've been having whatever you buy a new shirt I cut the tag out because I have an issue with tags giving my neck a rash because it makes my neck a change well the problem is that recently I've been having more of an issue where every time I cut on a tag it rips a hole in the back of my shirt now the thing is I can't have a tag in my shirt I just can't but now at least 60% of the shirts in my closet have like a hole where the tag used to be because I don't know how to function properly you guys have any tag cutting out tips for me how I can get my tag out of my [ __ ] clothing without ripping holes in my clothes let me know because it's really taking a toll on my everyday life another thing I've been thinking about recently I have a really big shopping issue and at first it wasn't really a problem but I went shopping four days in a row you think the problem is like I don't think that's good for me I really shouldn't be doing that but the problem is I don't know what else to do because it feels good buying clothes releases endorphins what I'm asking is what do I do instead all this [ __ ] you see back there that's the pink wall it's where all the [ __ ] insta bodies go to take pics I guess I just don't fit in there I'll actually tell a story about that pink wall if you want [ __ ] I have to find parking oh that [ __ ] hurted I forgot what I was talking about before I saw the pink wall so I'm just gonna ignore whatever I was saying before I started talking about the pink wall and just start talking about pink wall so one time my friend Amanda and I got in had a shitty day you know and we wanted to go be reckless outside why don't I feel like that's something like seven-year-old say like I wanna be like that so we drove to the pink wall at night because we're like nobody's gonna be there like none of the insta bodies are gonna be there like it's just free rain we can just check it out so you would see that see that's like you know so we went to the pink wall and while we're does this cat runs up and I was like what well naturally I took a lot of photos with this cat with me in my friend Amanda we're like this cat it's like outside on Melrose like this is not a safe area for a cat like you should probably call its owner to make sure theta isn't lost so I just rolled anyway make sure it's not lost because it's such a cute little sweet cat we wouldn't want it to get hurt out in the wild on Melrose you know what I mean with all the instabilities and stuff so we called the phone number on her collar or his collar I don't know I didn't observe the genitalia but we called the number on the collar and we left a message we're like your cat is on Melrose like hopefully that's allowed or hopefully your cats okay if you want us to bring it to you let us know whatever so we started to get nervous because we're like [ __ ] we can't just stay here with this cat forever I looked on its collar a little bit more to try to find out its name because I was like well if we're gonna be here for a while might as well [ __ ] get to know the thing you know what I mean so I looked at its collar and the caller said it's okay if I'm outside so basically this collar just roasted me and Amanda I was a little bit embarrassed but anyway we left the cat there and we moved forward I've been trying to park for the past 20 minutes only how does that parking no parking anytime oh why is everybody driving like stupid dumb idiot okay this is the one thing about LA that sucks the amount of time it takes to do a simple task it's like insane I'm upset okay and I've to make an illegal left turn I don't know if it's illegal but it should because this does not seem safe to me [Music] a parking spot no of course it's not try to [ __ ] go home at this point this is the first sunny day that I've had and quite some time and I don't know if it's making my mood better when it was really rainy for the past few days I was like when it gets sunny it's over for everyone else I'm gonna be in a [ __ ] amazing mood well I kind of feel like that goes in so today I'm also going to target I also really want to go to a dog shelter and pet dogs for the past like few weeks have wanted a dog so bad we're like for my whole [ __ ] life instead of like pushing those feelings away I'm gonna go to a dog rescue place and pet dogs and then probably fall in love with one and then probably end up adopting one cuz I have no self-control the last thing I need in my life right now is a [ __ ] dog but at the same time like I need a distraction from my self I'm pretty sure you might have to be with a parental guardian if you're like under 18 I might as well be 18 at this point why do I still have to [ __ ] be 17 I still do it up the pediatrician the baby doctor the baby dentist I might as well be seven yesterday I went to the doctor's office and I was like why are there blocks in here I'll be 18 in literally like or months or three wait hope it's in three months well that's [ __ ] scary I love being a kid it's so nice you just get like a pass go like oh monopoly it's just easy everyone boys make excuses for you it's great so I gotta turn eighteen all that's gone but at least I'll be able to buy myself lottery tickets I didn't really park that close to the coffee shop so now I'm just [ __ ] walking kind of a nice day out though this is the first day it hasn't rained in a while so kind of feeling good about that but our view in LA is that it always like stress out that you're gonna see someone that you know similar to high school there's always that little fear where it's like am I gonna see that I know it's even worse when you're by yourself like I'm by myself right now you might see someone I know that's [ __ ] embarrassing cause it's like I'm by myself they're probably gonna be with their friends now I look stupid I feel period blood dripping down my legs you guys probably think Emma why do you lie about always having your period I'm not I just have my period a lot for some reason it's not gonna do it not important but I do have period blood dripping down my legs and I don't really know to do because they don't have a tampon it's now gonna ruin my pants yummy and my tummy let me see if my mom is ready for me to pick her up so we can go see puppies [ __ ] I'm sweaty it's sad that I can't listen to music with you guys in the car anymore because it gets copyrighted so well you can't hear what I'm listening to but I know so are you ready to go see puppies and then I finally fall in love with one and then get really sad when we can't buy it oh yeah should we buy one yeah yeah it's not really good I do yeah but maybe I'm just being nice so that you let me buy a puppy you want to get your head in it at least a little bit of this video just like a mom interview you know what I mean just kind of interview you see how it's been being my mom recently okay okay so you made a little sound right there so I'm just wondering like what's wrong in some respects but other the demands like what like ending my lease making you do all that or making you go to animal shelters with me and then once I decided I can't adopt any of them but fall in love with them I yell at you about any people it's always down to the [ __ ] wire like oh I have to keep you on your toes I like have one date you terminate early write letters terminate leases go to the bank you know find new leases get you know like everything seventeen you still have to do everything buddy I think this talk is over so let's gonna talk about how excited we are to see puppy I'm excited to see companies for dogs fall in love with one it's literally like it you know probably the funny of happy a light and I'm probably gonna regret it out of every time in my life thus far it's just probably been like maybe the worst time for me to get a dog yeah I'm literally setting myself up right now to fall in love with one and ruin both of our lives but it's not just gonna ruin mine it's gonna ruin mine okay well one more question for mom and then I'll leave you alone you me LaBrie for a minute do you think I need your near gets the can this is sketchy ball this is a good question do you think I'm crazy or do you just think I'm smart you're like a frantic genius okay that's what I'm saying yeah you're not insane you're not insane or crazy you're just you know you hear on a whole nother like speed limit I think you're wired like you could never even just go sit on the body without an iPad I just want to pet a puppy and not phone with it but I'm really sensitive I'm either gonna get heartbroken or be weak-minded and then buy it well it's not buying it you're adopting it okay like I'm just saying like I that was just what slipped out you know I had a bad grammar are you having gone to school like a year and a half [Applause] oh my god oh no they're about to bring the puppies in oh my god this is gonna be dangerous this is so DS I'm so [ __ ] this is she's so chill bro go [ __ ] chill she is oh she's so chill do we look good together I just want to nurture you and take care of you and turn you into a big girl dog it takes care of herself and stuff and I want to take you to the coffee shops with me and we can drink coffee together in a BabyBjorn I'm not kidding like I don't know what to do see they know puppies is that they don't really do much it's [ __ ] knew this was gonna happen just kidding I didn't get it done I really was close to getting that [ __ ] puppy but I was like Emma don't be [ __ ] stupid be proud of me I'm so proud of you really it was hard anyway that's it for today's video I think actually no maybe it's not cuz I'm probably gonna go to Target later [Music] put it down okay but okay but put it down mom fell over I'm so glad I didn't get a dog today because I have Amanda stop I don't need my own dog I have this one [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2019-02-11T20:27:42Z,411107,8459329,20770,"hi! *intro music* *shattering sound* *upbeat music* ew I just farted and it, like, wafted up and i now smell it so that was gross but hey! it's time for another cooking with emma it's been too long and i miss it and you guys apparently miss it too because you guys comment about it every once in a while if you guys want something, then i do it because i'm your bitch, so *burps twice* oh my fuck- i'm sick of this in today's installment, we're going to be making homemade burritos somehow this hasn't happened yet i don't know how i haven't thought of this i'm just really stupid 90% of the time originally i was like okay, well making a burrito really isn't that hard you just have to, like, warm up a tortilla, warm up rice warm up black beans, warm up chee- okay well you don't really warm up the cheese but you just put it all together and it's done so i was going to originally make hot sauce i even bought all of the ingredients i bought an onion... what if i said onion like that would you guys still be my friend? i bought garlic, and, like, hot peppers and, like, vinegar and oil and, like, all this shit for it well, now i've been procrastinating on filming for the past three hours and it's now 1:30am and so i'm not gonna make the hot sauce anymore but i'm not gonna let these hot peppers go to waste so i thought that i would eat one and see how that went i'm probably gonna burn off all of- all my tastebuds and then i won't be able to taste the burrito but whatever i'm not even hungry anyway so let me try this these are serrano peppers when i was at whole foods buying these the lady that was checking me out was like ""why do you have twenty of these? they're very spicy"" i was like, ""oh, i don't know, the hot sauce recipe i found online said twenty peppers"" she was like, ""don't do that, only buy one"" so i was like, ""okay"" uh, well i didn't listen to her and now i have twenty of these so if they taste good, then maybe i'll just snack on em on the weekends maybe dip em in some hummus or something but according to what she said, these aren't, um that type of pepper, so *dramatic sound effect* i don't know how much to eat, like i don't wanna hurt myself *suspenseful sound* oh my god *suspenseful music* oh my god, no, fuck, that's so bad i'm not fucking around oh my god, ow *burps* oh my god, i'm dry heaving what the fuck did i just do *burps* *gags* *burps* *burps* kay, let's get started *slurping* i'm so fucking stupid *sniffs* oh my fucking god ah ughh - [friend] are you ok? - [emma] no! ok so you know how i bought those peppers for this video? - yeah? - instead of making the hot sauce i thought it would be good content to just eat one i was dry heaving over my fucking trash can i shouldn't have done that now that we've done that i'm gonna make myself a coffee because as you can see right here i have beautiful new espresso machine thank you [whispering] ethan i have not used it yet in a video so you guys haven't seen the beauty of this thing this big monster *sniffs* but i thought it would be fitting to, you know, spice things up and make a coffee kind of get some- you know, feel like the good old days you know what i mean? *sniffs* i'm gonna make an iced almond milk latte bringing it really back to the good old days *wah wah sound effect* this thing is a fuckin beast *sniffs* *booing* oh- kay that was not the way to do that *burps* ooh these smell really good oh, okay now that we've done that- i hope i did that right cause that machine has a lot of different buttons and i don't always know how to use it so that's... my fault i'm making a double shot coffee because even though it's 1am, i don't care about my well being and so let's just do it yay! aaah *upbeat music* *sniffs* also, while the coffee is brewing let's talk about the fact that i have valentine's day merch speaking of coffee, it says coffee right here on the little tongue if you wanna buy this, link in my bio i think it's pretty fun, kinda limited edition valentine's day tends to be a very upsetting holiday this might make the day a little bit better yeah, like this doesn't just- *mystery sound effect* this must be worn all year round look at that thing working its wonders back there i'm hype, don't know about y'all *laughs* okay, i- *farting sound effect* oh my god i almost peed myself, wait *farting sound effect* okay whatever, fuck this these are, like, professional as fuck like look at this! *music* shouldn't have done that i literally look like i have my own little at-home cafe *guitar music* so dope! *slurping* *gasps* oh, fuck *slurping* mmm, oh yeah those are some good fucking beans, holy shit raise the roof! okay let's get started for starters, i'm taking these peppers watch this, really cool, how i'm gonna do this *explosion sound effect* today i'm going to be making a burrito that's similar to what i would order at a restaurant if you didn't know, one of my favorite foods of all time is a burrito i love breakfast burritos, i love- i love every burrito today we're making wheat tortilla, black beans rice, and normal cheese burrito because you know what? i try not to eat dairy unless it's in a burrito, that is my only exception because guess what... it just feels wrong if you eat it with vegan cheese and a little diarrhea never hurt nobody! *mystery sound effect* i thought that these were rotten because i didn't have any tortillas except for these ones in my freezer that i actually bought when i moved here like, six months ago they were in the freezer, thank god, because if that was not the case they would have been rotten by... september 22nd, 2018 as cooking with emma always goes cooking with emma is not educational i'm not teaching you how to do anything because i don't know what i'm doing so that would just be manipulative and unfair instead, we're just having fun together hanging out while i cook for myself a meal that i probably won't end up eating it's really... a good system we have going and there's a reason why i haven't made these types of videos in a while and it's because they are kind of pointless not my fault where's my can opener? like who moves that? i don't- i literally live by myself who would have moved it? oh, it's right here okay, actually i know who moved it, it was my mom cause she came here and reorganized my whole apartment cause i don't know what i'm doing in that department *crickets* *confused sound effect* i don't even know how to open a can honestly oh no that's right! *laughs* hi, i'm wifey material oh, maybe not every time i open a can i cut myself on the top of it so i'm gonna try to make today not the day *dramatic sound effect* no cuts yet, today might not be the day oh my god, i did it so pouring black beans into the strainer because i don't want the black bean juice all over it, that's gross *boing* *crash* *twang* you know, i haven't really talked to you guys about my life recently i don't really talk to you guys about my life much anymore because i always just assume that nobody cares, but i think that that's kind of a personal issue for me and that you know, maybe you guys do wanna know what's going on in my life or something and if you don't, well, fuckin sorry i don't really know what else to talk about because i'm making a object that's so easy to cook that literally cookbooks don't even have recipes on how to cook this because it's that easy so now we're just gonna talk about my life cause i'm conceited rinsing off my beans, tee hee first let's talk about some things that have happened to me that no one knows about for starters, let me tell you a story this might not even be an interesting one but at this point i don't think my life is interesting enough to really provide much, so we're just gonna see how the story goes the mailroom in my apartment lost one of my packages it was a christmas gift and my mailroom lost it just fucking lost it like it was nothing to them i obviously, naturally, was very upset and decided that i would take matters into my own hands and harass them every day to see if it came in actually, i know it had come in because dhl sent me an email saying that my leasing office signed for the package so i was like, ""okay, well then they have it"" i'm starting to get very upset because this is a gift that i would like to give to the person i bought it for and now i can't so i look like a fucking fraud i look like i didn't even buy them said gift this is upsetting to me my mom and i were on text back and forth and she was like, ""hey, maybe you should check your mailroom"" because my packages go to my leasing office and then my small, like, envelope kind of packages go to my mailroom which is something that i have a key for quick note: i check my mailbox maybe once every two months i normally don't check my mailbox so my mom was like, ""maybe check it cause maybe the lost package went there instead"" i go to my mailroom not the leasing office, the mailroom this story's already complicated what have i started here i go to the mailroom and the mail guy's in there never seen him before okay i'm gonna insert what my mailboxes look like in my apartment building all of those were open like this the mail guy opens all of those up when he's putting packages and letters and things like that into everybody's mailboxes all at once so that he doesn't have to open up every single one individually it just all opens up so that you can see everybody's so you can just shove em all in quickly and efficiently well i check my mail the mail guy looks at me and he's like ""what are you doing?"" and i was like, ""oh, i'm getting my mail"" he was like, ""why?"" i was like, ""cause i need to get my mail?"" and then i was like, okay well he probably thinks i'm a little suspicious because i just happen to be getting the mail while he was... *sad music* ow, oh my god, ow this is the type of stuff i have to do on youtube to be funny shit like that, hurt myself this might be the shortest cooking with emma in history i'm literally almost done with this burrito oh fuck, i'm burning this fucking tortilla, aren't i? okay *crickets* *explosion sound effect* kay, now i have to use a different one well let's go back to the fucking story! so long story short- i always say that and it's never a long story short it always long story long for me cause i love to talk about myself anyway, he starts giving me the eyes not like, the eyes like *sexy music* like, the eyes like *wah wah sound effect* and i was not having it i was getting offended because i was like this guy doesn't trust me that i live in this building yet i'm in here meaning that i have a fob and i was upset i've said that, like, seven times wha- what's my point here again? so i was like, ""oh if you want i can just get my mail another time because i know that you're- *coffee machine starts making noise* my espresso machine pees a little bit when i turn it off i don't know why do you know what? this is why cooking with emma doesn't work because i just get distracted and then i never actually get anywhere sorry, but *playful music* so i told him, i was like ""hey if you want, i can just come back another time and get my mail"" and he was like, ""no it's fine, i just wanna know why you're doing it right now withou- with me here"" i was like, ""because i was walking out of my apartment and you were just sitting right there and it just happened to be that you were refilling the mail while i was leaving my apartment"" he was like, ""alright, whatever"" and just like, was being super rude but just like, kinda left me alone and i was like okay, i'm off the hook i guess well i wasn't off the hook so i'm looking through my mail and i was about to get in my car so i didn't want to grab all of my mail i was like, okay, i'm just gonna grab some of my mail at this point i had already looked for my missing package and it wasn't there so i was like, alright, well i guess i'll just get my mail while i'm at it then because i'm already fuckin here and then i'll get the rest later when i come back to my apartment in a few days well he notices this and this is something that he did not enjoy he was like, ""why'd you only get some of your mail?"" and i was like, ""oh i just wanted to get the stuff that i needed right now"" for example, my acne medication, stuff like that that i needed for the next few days whereas a phone bill is something i'm not gonna need for another six months cause i'm probably gonna forget to pay it he was like, ""why would you get it later when you can get it right now?"" i'm like, ""well cause i'm about to go in my car so, like, i don't really think i need it right now"" and he was like, ""well why don't you just get it right now?"" at this point, i'm starting to get mad cause this guy's just fucking harrassing me at this point it's none of his business whether i get my mail now or i get my mail later or if the way that i get my mail it doesn't please him that's really none of his business i'm getting frustrated, i'm getting fucking pissed so i was like, ""i don't wanna get it right now i'm gonna get it when i come back, what is it to you?"" sassy emma comes out, she doesn't come out a lot but when she does, it gets serious this pisses him off and he just almost screams at me ""what's wrong with you?!"" and i was like, ""what's wrong with me? what's wrong with you?!"" like, i don't see what the issue is i think i'm a pretty reasonable person and i think that the way this man acted out at me was not fuckin cool, i- i think i'm a pretty respectable person! after that, i got in the elevator and i fucking cried what did i learn from this? i don't know how to cook a burrito and this looks like shit you would think considering it's literally my favorite food that i'd, like, know how to cook one but, like, you're wrong cause i can't and this looks like shit but i'm still gonna try it anyway cause i'm... kind of hungry even though i'm not actually hungry it's just one of those things where it's like i'm bored so i'm hungry *dramatic music* mmm, mmm, okay what? *guitar music* wait what? why is this not bad? okay! you know what? maybe the fact that this is literally my favorite food made it easier for me to cook it because i'm such a pro at knowing what i like about it *music* it's not the best considering that i made it, and i have a very low iq i'm not mad about this! i mean also, like, this random salsa that i had in my pantry, that definitely helps a little bit *music* [inaudible] i might eat this shit! it's hella good! i think the main issue is that it's slightly lacking flavor but the salsa kinda makes up for it it's actually really... not that bad this is probably the best cooking with emma that's ever happened but anyway, hope you enjoyed my pointless story that kinda just took up this whole video, but that was really upsetting for me, i cried, um which is al- it's not really... too much of a... shock [inaudible] i have to clean up this mess i also got rice all over the floor so i'm probably gonna have to vacuum also this is not the only burrito i had today i also had one this morning i really probably- like my doctor's probably concerned watching this right now, being like- not like my doctor's watching this i don't know why my doctor would be watching this but just in case my doctor was watching this it's probably not healthy to have more than one burrito in one day, but *crunch sound effect* *catchy music* alright, i think that's about it for today's cooking with emma do you want me to keep doing this shit? as i said earlier, i'll do it cause i'm your bitch just let me know, let me know what you like [to friend] what do you want?! - [friend] i just heard you saying you were done and i want to eat it - [emma] i already ate it do you want me to make you another one? - do you have enough to make another one? - oh my god, i have more than enough it wasn't the best, but it was decent or do you want a quesadilla? - yeah - i can do that for you - really? - yeah, these tortillas kinda suck though - are they still good, like did- - oh yeah, totally - did you check the date and everything? - i froze them, so they were- they're good till forever - are you sure? - yeah *burps* - yeah, i'd eat a quesadilla can you make coffee? - mhm, try it *turbo sound effect* - ooh, i kinda want one - you want a coffee? - i mean are we staying awake to edit or no? - yeah, we're never sleeping again - why is there a big puddle on your floor? - um... i peepeed! i peepee on floor it's an ice cube that melted when i was trying to cool my mouth down from the pepper, i got- i put a ice cube in there but then the ice cube was too cold so i went... i'll sh- demonstrate what i did - kay now there's gonna be two- what is that? - that is my dish rack, okay bye *beep* [emma voiceover] so after i finished filming i made amanda a quesadilla but the sad part was that there was actually a hair in it so, okay, have a good day, love you guys, bye okay i'm almost done talking but, like, not quite because i have one more exciting announcement i- well actually there wasn't any other announcements in this video, okay, whatever i just launched channel members on my channel so if you wanna sign up for that, go ahead go on my channel and click the join button next to the subscribe button and it'll give you all the info before you wanna sign up if that's something you wanna do so go check that out and that's it okay, now i'm done, okay bye, love you bye *outro music*"

-emma chamberlain",2019-02-03T19:57:43Z,417881,8703823,18250,"hi guys *burps* *breath of reality rn* wow that felt really good wow that's actually really nice i really recommend that for you if you ever wanna just take it down a peg and relax deep breaths: UNDERRATED so i had an idea and today i'm filming it and i think its gonna be really fun this video kinda doesn't have any sort of real purpose to it, but I think it's- that's kind of just what youtube is at this point, so, i mean i don't really feel like there's a problem with it today, I'm putting myself to the fashion test and you're probably like, tf? well, I'm gonna go to the mall my literal least favorite place in the entire world i f*cking hate the mall too many people trying to give you a weird lotion        (um ok sis) too many people trying to give you a massage maybe these are just the malls i've gone to idk maybe I just need to f*cking go to a different mall dude, actually i always am going to different malls, so this is just every mall the stores are so crowded and like uUgHhH but today I thought it would be fun if I went to the mall and instead of going into the normal stores that I go into because nobody goes into every store in the mall let's stop talking about malls and start talking about what the f*cking vidEo iS aBouT cAuSe I hAvEn'T sAiD tHaT yEt *triggered* i thought it'd be fun if I chose a few stores that i normally don't go into when i go to a mall and try to pick out an outfit from each if you go somewhere like urban outfitters, you already know you're gonna find cute sh*t when you go into urban outfitters, it's a matter of what's my favorite not like what's not ugly you know what I mean? but I was like, it'd be fun if I tried out why am I screaming?? that's today's videooo.. so i think this is gonna be really fun and yeah so I will see you guys when I get back from the mall, and I have all my shtuff i'm excited cause wait, why am i excited? these are stores that i literally have never gone into in my entire f*cking life i'm interested to see what a store looks like inside that's not urban outfitters like that sounds interesting to me, i dont know i think it's gonna be really fun, okay i think it's gonna be really f*cking awesome my coffee is melted *slurps* ugh, kind of tastes like throw up i have to drive to a mall like 30 minutes away because all the malls near me don't really have stores that i don't shop at most malls around here don't have any of that good good, you know ugh *booing* that was so embarrassing for me you know just busy doing unicorn stuff finally done shopping I literally shopped for f*cking three hours *sighs*ohh my god i feel like with some of the stores i actually did good like genuinely good for like what the options were i got a little creative you know i mean i had to considering i went to f*cking children's place i think the harder place to shop at was like the adult stores because ugh sorry just farted i'm really tired i'm never going shopping again just kidding i'm definitely gonna go shopping again got it i'm never fu-- i'm never going to a mall ag-- never going to a mall again this was a lot harder than i expected i went to: two children's stores and to kind of like mom-style stores like stuff that like women above 40 wear i went to: justice, children's place, both being children's stores banana republic, which is like a classy store and then express, which is like i don't actually know who shops there i just know i don't, so that's why it works with this video also, a few things i think i'm gonna have to crop them because they're just too f*ckin' ugly uh, let me f*cking tell you when I was in justice, the employee came up to me and she was like ""who are you shopping for?"" and i was like, ""oh my sister"" i don't have a f*cking sister (only chiiild) i just didn't want anyone to know she was like ""oh how old is she?"" and at first I was gonna say 'she's 17' because like that was really the immediate thing i was gonna say cause I'm shopping for myself if that makes sense then i was like wait f*ck i can't say that, that sounds weird so I was like, ""ah, she's 12"" and then the lady looked at the stuff that I had in my hand and shes like ""those won't fit a twelve-year-old"" and I was like ""they fit my sister, so... this is her size"" so.. she knew it was for me anyway, let's just get right into trying the shit on and seeing if i did a good job and if i have a future in fashion design if i can f*cking find an outfit at children's place, i can do anything *slurps* okay, so for the first pl-- okay, so for the first place that i went, i went to children's place umm, i'm nervous about this one now, i need to make some altercations--wait--alterations? altercations? *i cant speak* alteration? whatever i need to make somE ADJUSTMENTS i want to crop a few things to make it a little bit more cuter and trendier this might not even fit me, but I'll take that risk hopefully i don't cut this too short and then i can't wear it because this video would get demonetized well that was an easy fix! now that the shirt is cropped, let's get that sh*t on let's get that sh*t ooo-- okay, I appreciate my effort with this one so let me explain what I did here the second that I saw that they had, ""biker shorts"" i was like- well that's definitely what I'm going to do because biker shorts are a big trend rn uh, sadly, these are way too long they fit awful they're just ugly the shirt, the shirt is not that bad though like look at this sh*t. i love f*ckin' mario cart. so this overall, honestly, considering i bought this outfit at children's place i mean like this really isn't that bad. umm (emma editing) you're lying to yourself.... yeah, uh this i--this sucks. I tried to pair it with these shoes to make it--it just--it's very dissapointing so, first outfit was a success, I would say, considering the circumstance but it's also a failure because it's f*cking ugly idk tell me what you think down below in the comments anyways plot twist: at every other place, i onl-- do i have a camel toe? f*ck at every other store, i only bought one outfit but at children's place, i actually bought two because i was conflicted about which outfit was better so let's get to the second children's place outfit and see if it is better than this one which honestly I don't think it is, so we will see okayyy you can see my nipples through this shirt so I'm going to cover my nipples for the rest of this clip the main reason i wanted to did this outfit was because I have a shirt almost identical to this from brandy melville and, when i saw it, i was like, holy sh*t this is like the same f*cking thing It's way too small and it's cutting off my armpit, which really f*cking hurts also, these jeans fit awful. they fit pretty well around legs, but then the waist it's just- which doesn't really make any sense because like the legs fit me is it--I literally feel like these pants just told me that i have a flat @ss nothing about this is good. i don't even like skinny jeans, so i really know why i'm... why i chose this this top cutting off my armpit circulation ughh okay, the next store that i went to was... banana republic...? banana republic what am i? a f*ckin third grade teacher? but overall, this was probably one of the most difficult shopping experience i encountered as you can probably tell by my outfit it didn't really go so well literally they had no tops that weren't like super low v-neck or like a tunic soo, this was kind of all i had honestly if i was a school t--oh my god, my thumb is bleeding what the f*ck, why is it bleeding? that's weird anyway, if i was a third grade school teacher i would definitely wear this might've done something right oh, I also got these hoop earrings, which are actually really cute and I probably gonna wear these sometimes because I really like hoop earrings so that was kind of not that bad i literally look like a f*cking orchestra teacher or like yoga teacher or like third grade teacher next store i went to was... express. what did i even buy? oh! okay. this shirt that i bought for this outfit is r- ugh really long, so i thought if i cropped it, it would be a little more trendy we'll see how that goes shirt is cropped. that's way better, i would honestly wear this. i'd wear this. this outfit is definitely the best is it good? no. but at this point, none of them were good imitation 'i am gia' f*ckin cargo shorts are super in and trendy this cropped shirt or something, i'd actually probably wear these glasses suck you know what? this outfit is actually not bad i feel like i would have worn this like a few months ago, but because my style changes so quickly, i would already be sick of it do you know what? i respect this place *coughs* bye. last but not least, i went to justice and I do need to make an alt-- adjustment. to one of the clothing items and I need to crop this tank top so, let's just do it definitely might have cut this too short oh, yeah, that's really short let's get that sh*t on. i made a lot of mistakes this skirt is number one: way too big for me number two: wait, built in shorts and number three: i cropped this way too short i literally feel like i'm f*cking naked in front of the camera right now i was really hoping to go for a like kind of a 90s denim skirt, cropped white tee vibe it didn't work the skirt is wayyy too long actually, it's not that long no, it's long i mean, i don't know what i was expecting at this point if you consider that this was from justice, i guess it's not that bad why is the fly so short on this f*cking denim skirt like, and there isn't even a zipper anyway there's literally no zipper on these because they can't trust little kids with zippers for some reason.. this was a f*cking failure and I don't want to be in this outfit anymore ohhhh another thing when I was trying on my children's place outfits i forgot that i actually bought shoes from children's place and i forgot to put them on so i think it would be fitting to add the children's place shoes that i forgot to try on with my justice outfit this video is getting very confusing for even me and i'm filming it so hopefully you're on the same page as me but anyway, i'll try those on real quick for the runway show oh god, they're really ugly here are the shoes from children's place they kind of look like high-top vans mixed with like some sort of nike jordan i don't f*cking know i don't even know if they're gonna fit so oh my god, they do ooo are they too big for me what the f*ck? dude, i go shopping at children's places and get sizes too big for me how the f*ck? oh, god, these suck ugh what the f*ck was i thinking? EW oh god. that's it. i love you guys so much and, uh, i hope you guys have an amazing day peace out. byeeeee sorry, that intro was so short it kind of feels awkward and short but i don't have anything else to say so byeeeee"

-emma chamberlain",2019-01-20T21:58:16Z,370382,11674304,15168,"Olivia: You alive? Olivia: There we go. [Sad music] Burrito diet, day nine. [Crunch sounds] Emma: [Quietly] Okay. Emma: Alright, ladies. Yeah, 'cause we all know how they get soggy. Hey Amanda, it's still good! That was fucking exhausting, mentally. [Loud slurp] Cheers. I'm gonna have to shit later. Same. Oh hi! Good morning! What are we doing today, ladies? One, two, three— Amanda and Olivia: We're going to San Francisco!
Emma: Roadtrip! [Crickets] Wanna try again? One, two, three— Amanda and Olivia: We're going to San Francisco!
Emma: Roadtrip! Who's off? It's me Amanda and Olivia: We're going to San Francisco!
Emma: Roadtrip! What? Emma: Roadtrip!
Amanda and Olivia: We're going to San Francisco! We're starting out our morning with our favourite breakfast burrito! Amanda woke up angry. Amanda woke up angry. Shall we elaborate on that? Amanda, would you like to speak on it? That's what being friends with YouTubers is like. I was trying to wake Amanda up, and I started running out of options. I was shaking her... nothing was working. So I just tried to tickle her neck, but it didn't work. Tickle?! Yeah! [Quirky music] I decided that it would be fun if I took my BFFs to fuckin San Francisco with me because that's where I'm from. We've been wanting to road trip— Olivia: You're from there? Uh... yah I wanted to take them to San Francisco so that they could experience my childhood and also we were bored and didn't want to be in LA anymore and I just spilled hot sauce on my leg. Wanna come lick it off? I know the answer is no. [Quirky music] This burrito slapped so hard. My nose is fucking running from the hot sauce, holy shit. [Loud sniff] Road trip starts now! We're going to San Francisco, it's 7 AM, and we're going to San Francisco, and we're gonna be there at some point. We're gonna give you hourly updates. Maybe. Probably not. Oh my God, sweat is dripping. [Sniff] Did you just fucking smell it? [Sniff] We've been driving for officially an hour. Amanda's sleeping back there, as you can see. [Loud snoring] We've been driving for a while. We've just been jamming out to music, talking about the texture of milk because it's really not a good texture, now is it? Anyone who wakes up in the morning and thinks, ""Let me pour myself a nice cold glass of MILK""? MILK? Melk. You had childhood issues. Milk ain't gonna fix shit in your life, so... New Years resolution:
Emma: Don't drink milk! Olivia: Stop drinking milk! Funny story, I hate paper straws. [Mariachi music] How you guys feeling? Well we know how Amanda's feeling [Snoring] I love woadtwips! How are ya?! You just sounded like fucking Jeffree Star. How are ya?! Jeffree Star if you're watching this, pipe it up and stab on me. I'm Jeffree Star. What? Yup... I don't have anything to follow that. Dude, the fog is insane. [Cough] Did you see that?! Okay, so guys, I think I have a wart on my leg. Olivia: bruh! Do I have a wart like right here? Oh my god I just— Bro, I heard it leak. I get—*sniff*—no, no Did you just put your hand on your ass and then smell it? No! No, no. What if I fucking cupped—okay— You have. You have before! Don't act like you haven't palm bombed yourself! Haven't WHAT? Olivia: Pum bummed? You fart in your hand and then smell it Okay, I was, like, 8. Okay, this was, like, last week! I did it that one time when I was little because my Dad used to tell me that his siblings used to palm bomb him. Sadly, I don't have siblings so I had to do it to myself That's upsetting... You should be drinking milk 'cos your childhood was fucked up Emma: Yeah, I know! See, there was a day in my life, there was a time in my childhood when I had to drink milk because everything was so messed up and I couldn't see what was light and what was dark, and only milk! ha ha ha I was in the car, hand on my ass, I farted in my hand and put it in my face I put it in my face! It's so nice in my face! [Bleeping] [Cymbal crash] [Laughter] Dude, focus on my fucking head! Jesus Christ! That's what he said. Dude, you make a really good point with that one. I didn't brush my teeth this morning. I didn't either. Pound it. Guess who's awake! Olivia: Guess who's awake! Why don't you talk about why you were in a bad mood and how it relates to me? Umm... Be nice about it I'm kind of sensitive Okay, so when Emma sets an alarm— She sets 30. Amanda: and not only does she set 30, but when they go off, —the most annoying ringtone. Oh! THE TONE! [Alarm tone] Oh yeah. Fuck that shit. Wait, I'm triggered. You can't play it again. [Alarm tone] NO! So that was what was going on, for, like, an hour this morning— Olivia: But Emma sleeps through them!
Amanda: She doesn't turn it off! Olivia: And we're like ""Hey Emma, hey, hey, Emma,"" and she's like, ""What?"" and I'm like, ""Can you shut that off?"" she's like, ""What?"" and I'm like— [Suspenseful music] I can't hear alarms! [Animal noises] Make it stop, make it stop! [Animal noises] oh lol Shoutout to the hate account that told me I had crusty lips, look at these hoes! They wet as fuck. Emma: What hour are we on? Olivia: Three and a half? Oh my God, there's your credit card information! In a better mood now even though we didn't play Nickelback for you? I'm just—my feelings are hurt. Amanda loves Nickelback, but I mean, I just can't say the same about myself. Oh my God, they have frozen yogurt here! Too bad I'm not gonna get it 'cause I don't wanna have diarrhea. Emma: Really?
Olivia: Yeah! Emma: Diarrhea's good. It kind of makes things more interesting. Have fun. Emma: What? Olivia: I wanna play the game, I wanna win that! Emma: What's that? Olivia: It's an iPad Olivia: and it's blue! Emma: Wait, it's blue? Olivia: It's blue! Emma: Does that even exist?! It does here, wherever the fuck we are! Emma: I'm tryna get a Beats Pill right about now. [Electronic music] Emma: Guys, take a look at this. It has lollipops with bugs in it. Is that, like, a freaking dung beetle? Like, what even is that? Cashier: Anything else? Emma: That's it Emma: Did you put your tampon in? [Sad music] Her period hit her hard this month. [Light music] Eh... it kind of just reminds me of how I drive. We have, officially, 25 minutes left. We're making a quick detour instead of going straight to our hotel. We are actually going to visit my mom first and just say 'what's up' to mommy! Then we're gonna say hi to my animals— *Siri* Shut the fuck up. Okay... No, not you! I'm talking to the fucking Siri guy, cuz your Siri has a male voice? [Burp] What did that taste like? So, why don't we all go through and give an update? Olivia first. We just life coached Josie for the past 45 minutes. Josie— [Siri] Josie we love you. I'm feeling pretty good. Our friend called us and we just gave her an entire TED talk that she did not want. Emma: Did you like it? Josie: No. My burp tasted like a barbecue chip. No way! That's what it tasted like. Emma: Are we ready for that? [Sniff] I'm so sweaty! Oh Amanda, you never gave your update, how do you feel? Amanda: Good! We still haven't played Nickelback for her. Maybe we'll play it on the way home, but that's only if she gets lucky. I just... [Sad music] Okay but also, like, if worse comes to worst, when you get to the hotel, you can just put in your AirPods, sit on the toilet, and listen to Nickelback and then— I got yelled at for putting in my AirPods earlier! That is true. Guys, there was a girl driving next to us and we both applied chapstick at the same time. Emma: No way! [Burp] That was a gross one. We're in the water! Ahhhh! I'm really excited because we're staying at the Hotel Nikko and they have a dog on site and we already made an appointment to hang out with the dog when we arrive. There's, like, sharks in the water here! I haven't blinked in a minute. Okay, guys. Now do me a huge— [Sigh] We should try that again. Three, two, one, action! Okay guys, this is a big deal. Now, do me a huge favor and for the next few seconds pay attention to how many times Olivia blinks. Olivia: Shut the fuck up I haven't blinked in two minutes. I think I've passed the point in life where I need to blink. All: Are you sure? Go back, watch that footage. Guarantee you she blinked. Wait, let's all do a competition, see who can not blink for the longest. The AC is blowing to straight into my eyeballs. So, let's see how long we last. Three, two, one, go. Now blinking is all I can think about. Oh, I blinked. Fuck. [Upbeat piano music] [Upbeat piano music] You're at a minute now. I told you. So, we're not gonna go to Alcatraz? Absolutely not. You would not have fun. Why would you want to spend 100 dollars to go to prison when you could just go to prison for free? Are you still not blinking? Still haven't blinked. It has been a minute thirty, and I'm getting scared. Emma: Have— [Animal noise] Sorry. [Animal noises] Okay, that's it. Olivia: That's all you get, folks! [Sexy music] Wait, why do I look sexy? [Sexy music] 'Kay. That's fine. Emma: Hi! Emma's mom: Hi, sweetie! Emma's mom: So happy you guys are here! Emma: Yay! Olivia: You're exactly what I pictured. Emma's mom: Do you want the light on? Oh my God, I'm just squeezing his little belly. I'm in love with him. [Cats noises] You're so cute, I'm gonna die! [Upbeat music] [Sexy music] Let's do a little hotel tour! How do you feel about that? We got the bathroom! Hi, it me or whatever! Ew. That was gross. We have the tub in the shower, which I won't be using. We have this whole living area. And then... that's it . Emma: Oh, wait, do we have a room key? Olivia: Yes, I do. Emma: Oh my god, you— see, thank God for you. Emma: Hi! Emma: Are you okay? Amanda: No! [Uplifting music] Hey! We just got back from shopping. I thought I would do a little try on haul for you guys and I have my two judges here to tell me if they're ugly or not because I didn't try them on. First thing I got is this. I wouldn't pair it like this, so don't judge, okay? It's from Urban Outfitters— Well, we're the judges. We're supposed to— So what do you think of this? But just imagine a with the cute outfit and not looking like fucking this, because this is bad. Ten out of ten. Texture.. mmm, could be better. So this is— this would be cute if I didn't wear it looking like... an idiot. Emma: Okay, moving on. This next thing was a complete impulse buy. Emma: I'm not sure if I made the right decision. Dude, I'm into this. I love corduroy. Gives me 80s movies vibes. I'm into it. Urban Outfitters, you did it again. That's the only place I went shopping. Emma: You guys approve? Yeah. All right, moving on! So, moving on to some more fun stuff, I'm now getting naked. [Suspenseful music] Nice! It's so bright! I'm uncomfortable. Also got this hat to match. Olivia: Perfect. [Crickets] Emma, cut that out. Emma? Hey! You there! Who, me? Hey, how's it going? You're editing right now? [Scared] Yeah, I'm editing. How did you know? Cut whatever you just saw out. [Scared] Okay... Oh wait, I'm putting on pants. I don't like how this looks without pants. This outfit is not fucking it, but this body suit is dope as fuck! I really like the pants! The pants are kind of fun. This outfit is not an outfit to wear together, guys. Don't get confused. But this body suit could be cool. I like the color. You have more bold— dare than I do. Yeah, well... We'll see if I ever actually wear this, so... Olivia: Alright. Emma: One more thing. [Olivia singing] [Olivia singing] [Amanda giggling] Are you going to the renaissance? No, it looks like— what's that show my mom watches? Downton Abbey? Emma: I don't even want to show this. For like—just run across the room. You have to! That's it! That's all you get! Show's over! Emma: Okay...okay... Emma: No. I HATE this. I'm saying this because I'm your friend, you have to take that back. Emma: Fuck this shirt. Return it. Emma: This is so ugly! Haul equals completed. Follow me on Instagram to see me actually wearing the outfits in a way that's not ugly because the way that I put on all of those things was awful, but you still get the idea enough where you know if it's ugly or not. Does that make sense? Did that make sense? Amanda: Yep. That's what people say about me, Hope you enjoyed my haul and we'll see you when we get dessert on room service. Cut! Okay. What button do I press though? I don't even know what I want. Hi! Can I order room service? Two chocolate cakes, one raspberry sorbet and one lemon sorbet. That's it. Thank you so much! Goodbye. Alright guys, how'd I do? [Whispering] Round of applause, round of applause. [Clapping] Thank you so much. Let's fucking eat, bitch. [Chuckling] [All] Ooohhh... Emma: Ooooooooo Let me do a little sorbet review. So this first one is RASPberry— Olivia: I want this. Oh, wow. Nice. Okay. So now let's try the lemon one. I used to be obsessed with lemon with lemon sorbet growing up. How about you guys? Amanda: Mhm. The lemon one's so it. Why is the best dessert room service? Olivia: Brain freeze? Emma Brain freeze. Olivia: Mmm. Emma: Mm-hmm. Uh. I'm kind of concerned about how good this is. Same. This is hot. [Moans] Olivia: Oh, my God! [Loud chewing] Ew! Ew, chewing ice cream is awful. No, you don't chew it! You put your tongue to the top of your mouth and, like, let the flavors explore. Olivia: My plate— [Booing] Olivia: —versus Amanda's— [Cheering] Olivia: Hers still has the mint and everything! Did you eat the mint? [Suspenseful music] You ate the mint?! You're not supposed to eat that! That's a decoration! You're allowed to eat the mint. [Laughing] You're allowed to eat the mint. What does it taste like? Olivia: Mint. It's a literal leaf! I mean, I'm not gonna act like I haven't done it. Why would you ever want to do that? Olivia: It's delicious. Okay, I'll eat one too, then. [Giggling] Olivia: Eat it. Swallow. You can't lie! It's bad! [Crickets] Emma: Oh, my God! woah I don't even know if I wanna open this now oh my god Too bright, vampires don't like this ok nevermind back to bed Look what we got Philz Amanda's never tried Philz and she likes it. So that means that I'm a good friend. Yes Sorry, all right ladies time to be ready I will choke you if you don't What the fuck was that No Here's my outfit of the day Thank you say something at least yeah, so we're gonna go get brunch now I look like fucking I Don't know what I look like anymore.

Okay How you doing back there ladies, good Cool. Well, um Can I help you? No, hey, but you came up when we took a nap actually I took a nap and we're gonna go to the Golden Gate Bridge with a bunch of other stuff But then we got lazy and didn't go and then instead just did more shopping now. I'm gonna do another try on haul because Olivia: you bought more clothes First thing I bought everything I bought was from Brandi. Is this hoodie? It says Another Oh No. Next is this nice V little long-sleeve shirt? Oh That's thing. I got a good stuff Next I got this long-sleeve shirt reminds me of like What do we think I like it I need to be fun I approve Next okay next I got a hoodie that I don't need okay. This one has a little little angel devil guy on it What do you guys think it is? Look how freaking cute that little man is definitely unnecessary purchase last but not least. So these are the sweats. What do we think guys? That was the most unnecessary haul ever because I didn't need any of that.

Well, I am. Olivia is just gonna film it for me. Because, I don't know why anyone would want to do this. What am I doing today? You may ask Well, you probably saw the title and I'm jumping into the ocean freezing ocean challenge. (cause thats a thing) Yes Yep Yes Is that a challenge? (no) yes yes (definitely not) I don't know if anyone else has ever done this ( they haven't) I mean There's definitely a very good chance of someone else on YouTube has done this challenge before (nope)  but I've never seen it So that means that I came up with it. Right? oRiGiNaL. [in denial] ...yes It's winter time in California, which means that the ocean is F@$CKING freezing. Well, it's always freezing, even in the [TruE] summer time the [You know what, true] Pacific's cold as (Beep) Emma: It's just always cold, but it's especially cold right now in (F***ing) JaNuaRy I thought it would be fun...

WE'RE IN TEXAS (umm) AGHGHGHGHAGAGHAHAGAHAHAGAHGHA I think I'm becoming a Texast. Grew up in California, but I am becoming a Texast. *Texas?* If you are what you eat, I am Texas. [suspenseful music plays] I don't even know what that means like, I don't even understand the joke and I made it. (ROUGH) Today's video is.... collaborations...

If you guys didn't know, I'm actually in their sWiM sQuAd tHiS yEaR Yeah, I went to the Bahamas with them to shoot for their bikini collection And it was vEry fun. A little bit nervous, for me, because I've never done anything like this But I was super excited because I grew up wearing Hollister. It was my vibe. SAME RIGHT? Mhm The thing that's cool about Hollister is they're just a very inclusive brand and they have a lot of different kinds of bathing suits to fit all shapes and sizes :) [sweet music] If you're watching this and you want to go check out me on the website. Go ahead, I'll leave the link in the description. You can go shop their bikinis. How do you think this is gonna go for me? I think you're gonna be cold as (beep)...

Goodbye The only hope that I have is that the burrito I ate this morning, is still in my stomach and will keep me warm Because there's a bunch of hot sauce on it And so now my stomach's like burning a little bit but like in a good way (mood) So, I'm just hoping that that keeps me warm while I'm in the cold water. Hashtag nervous. Also I'm really pale (me too sis) so don't judge that because it's winter so... How you doin? You ready? ORRRR you ready? ... Um um Olivia: So tell us what you're doing today. Tell us what you're about to do right here right now. Crazy (sh*t)! Ahahahahhhh! Right now, I am in THEE beach, the only one in the world. (XD) [Laughter] I also have to piss really bad might be in the ocean, but I think it's gonna be too cold (bitch has obvi never really been cold) The air is probably 55 degrees.

off and you're probably like Emma why did you take a week off well I did but I just didn't upload so I guess I kind of did take a week off except for that I didn't mean to take a week off because I was working on stuff it's just that I hated all of it let me explain I filmed three videos and edited a decent portion of each but ended up hating each video so I filmed three videos that I didn't like in a row so starting out 2019 with a bang hating all my content that I produce each video that I filmed was like decent like it wasn't bad it wasn't awful but it just wasn't up to par so I did the idea to throw all my favorite footage from each video into one video and make this video my deleted videos these are my deleted videos hi I'm home for the holidays which is you know fun that was here for like five days which is the longest I've been home for a long time usually I come for like two days and then a mental breakdown and then have to leave the first thing I'm doing is going to

like you said it so I got these cargo pants how the [ __ ] do I show this [ __ ] they're light wash and [ __ ] there you go well who thinks it I didn't write any of the songs I forgot this I just thought this cuz I like the color the button-down and it's the clothes pretty epic I think it's gonna be really cute alright they're not as soft anymore dude literally Brandi took their quality down a peg like the shit's not as obvious even dude there's not even close to his level of fuzzies anymore then I got these jeans cuz like [ __ ] I just like jeans Hamid um loves he already has these cuz I know you deaf I probably something so you know but I just you know I thought it was good okay next I'm so excited about this ish it's cute Assad kiss fool I am so sorry you okay okay so I got this corner Oy puffer you Jackie I'm probably never gonna wear it cuz it's always too hot in LA as every [ __ ] says when they do a [ __ ] haul and they're like it's too hot then I got these okay this is questionable we knew it's these [ __ ] like sweat shorts it might be Brandis way of announcing their boys collection [Music] hi I'm not at my house but that's okay because I don't like being at my house because I don't like being alone because I have issues with being by myself Happy New Year everybody I'm excited for this year because this last year was [ __ ] insane a lot of [ __ ] happened to me putting my hood on cuz I don't look good right now and I need to hide it it was a great year for me I did have a lot of mental writedowns but besides that it was a really great year and I had an idea I wanted to do a special fund special for the new year I had the idea to react to myself from a year ago I have changed a [ __ ] ton this year like I started out this year blonde and just different like when I watched videos of myself from a year ago I'm like who the [ __ ] was that I gathered a bunch of documentation of me from a year ago and I thought that I would react to it today and then we just see how magic changes here and comparing a dress it's like a scientific vignette so let's get into it sorry I look really ugly but that's not my fault maybe I take these off yeah whatever I'll go first thing we're gonna be reacting to from a year ago is my Instagram this is probably gonna be the least shocking because I feel like I'm pretty similar except for I did a lot more photoshoots and I probably tried a little bit harder now I gave up so I remember this photo shoot like it was yesterday I did a shoot with my dad used to do photo shoots made out all the time I wanted Instagram photos and I didn't know any photographers now I know photographers personal growth I love this photo of myself there's no [ __ ] reason my style was okay like I mean I'm wearing like a decent jacket like wearing is trendy beanie I mean like I'm not cringing the glasses are a little bit cringe I just wouldn't wear those now I also love this photo of myself okay why was I so conceited things have changed my self-esteem has it columbidae I literally would force my dad to wake up at like 6:00 a.m. and go shoot with me so that I could have Instagram photos and then I'd post 90 photos in the same outfit and that was probably really annoying also for some reason I guess I didn't have captions on these photos I still don't do that I'm not gonna Instagram captions some things never change okay this next photo has a caption thinking about toontown alright I mean I did like toontown not really at that time though I think I was just trying to like be quirky and dogged about toontown as if I still liked it which I didn't whatever this is kind of a boring video so far sorry 29 right this is all so weird to 2019 is my graduation year I already graduated high school I graduated a year early but this was supposed to be my grand year so congrats to me okay still [ __ ] talking Mattoon town and they literally edited this photo on visco and put green on it that's so embarrassing I really was obsessed with having a feedback then apparently felt cute in this elbow might delete soon annoying wow my hair looked really good it was all wavy and [ __ ] what the [ __ ] cannot relate right now wow you're look so good what was like doing differently that's disgusting and annoying when you're about to defeat a cog in toontown and your uncle comes in and says he needs to use the computer to buy an alligator illegally online what the [ __ ] does that mean I probably thought that was funny too that's like really sad the photos good like I'm not mad about the photo I don't like look that cringe in that mm I mean a little bit oh my god and I'm wearing the poopy jacket the hoji running a lot of people jagged since then also funny thing that I'm remembering while looking at these photos I was reading through some of the comments and it's so funny because back then no one hated me now people do hate me so that's okay though I guess I asked for it I don't know I have a lot more hashtag haters now so whatever photo Mia Denny's okay in the poopy jagged rock bottom yes this was rock bottom I was a mess in the beginning of last year I also have friends now I didn't really not friends cheers to me for making some friends that's good thanks for being my friend yeah next we're gonna react to my twitter twitter has this thing where you can only scroll back so far to like a certain point and then it cuts off and then you have to download your archive I didn't want to do that because I'm really [ __ ] lazy so I could only scroll back to March so just still the beginning of last year so I thought I just react to a few of those and then I somehow found a screenshot a little bit to weed that I tweeted so we're just gonna react to those few tweets that I have first let's talk about my [ __ ] avatar what the [ __ ] was that also little noob like I know I don't know I just don't want to talk about it also my username was different my twitter has glow of the [ __ ] up my [ __ ] profile picture now sway [ __ ] better I've been crying for four days with like 20 minute breaks in between I'm not even that sad I just can't stop that was a lie I was sad hi lately I've been sleeping like two hours a night menu - stop with that because making me sick as [ __ ] constantly so I can't upload the day after day I'm only uploading Thursdays and Sundays which literally makes me cry bad ass happened I'm sorry I love you little did I know that at one point I would now only upload like once a week maximum so like honestly that's generous back then all right now to some of the tweets from March pesto is magic I don't know anyone who doesn't like it you can't not like it that's true [ __ ] oh my god why is this kind of funny me after one glass of milk ooze up I'm drunk tweeting that's good I've tried cow's milk twice in my life okay no one gives a [ __ ] so moving on from Twitter alright next we're gonna look at some [ __ ] from my camera roll cuz I thought that would be kind of fun okay crying crying when people come and tell you to come oh my god this is when I started getting hate I didn't understand how do we deal with it still don't but I'm better now I can't believe I used to cry over that [ __ ] I don't cry over it now well defense oh my god me still crying I'm just emotional okay me with phil's that's heartwarming oh my god more crying okay me with my cat that's my mood I [ __ ] miss my dad why the [ __ ] ice cream job this mean this is literally a Chex Mix ad and I thought that their ad was funny what the [ __ ] that's sad what the [ __ ] is that I'm literally I'm done I don't wanna look at this anymore let's go to my snap memories this actually the last thing we're gonna be looking for sells vehicles over thank God right this was going to get hit in the face with the nerf gun that [ __ ] hurt it okay me eating a burrito oh my god I miss the burritos from the Bay Area [ __ ] okay this is me in the gym listening to someone brag about are they gonna Gale and travel a lot ha I feel stupid and poor ah yeah that [ __ ] still makes me feel stupid and poor literally why was I so obsessed with getting my dog's germs into my mouth me dye my hair blonde cannot relate don't do that anymore being blonde was definitely crackhead Howard it's like I was a [ __ ] crackhead when I dyed my hair blonde just didn't look good for me I know how do you guys miss it and stuff and tell me that but I don't miss it so sorry just sometimes I do though cuz blondes have more fun just kidding I had way more fun once I became brunette [Music] all right I don't want to talk about it I am what all I know is that my teeth were way [ __ ] straighter by then and i'm so triggered they look way better [Music] brush my hair in like two days don't give a [ __ ] I'm just shopping what lambda okay I look bad really bad [Music] hey here's what we're doing today I'm gonna be doing makeup that looks like this and you're falling like Emma why I think it would be fun all I know is I want to make myself look like that I don't know why I like the way it looks so much and I want to see how it would look on me I'm really even curiously because you're gonna see this concerning my last two videos were thrown away and did the trash straight into the trash where they belong it's just really interesting to think like I wasting my time right now is this even gonna hit the Internet let's talk about New Year's resolutions I don't have any because I don't believe in that [ __ ] if you're gonna do it you're gonna do it when you want to do it not when you already are gonna um [Music] you're not gonna just do it because it's a new year you would have already done it does that make sense ladies and gents do you own a thought would be kind of fun is to talk about 18 things that I learned in 2018 Wow I look [ __ ] awful this video is a mix let's start with the things that I learned this year don't dye your hair black if you're pale around June of this year I dyed my hair black I look like [ __ ] Snape from Harry Potter it was awful and ugly second thing I learned is music festivals are not fun it's always a waste of money in time but I'm still gonna go to Coachella this year so do bald people actually like wash their heads like with shampoo or did they just use body wash [Music] let's try to find a blush palette do I even have one I don't know oh my god I have blush I have blossom okay this is not as hard as I thought oh my god I'm having fun what if this becomes with my anything of you eh I might have put too much I put too much I don't [ __ ] know the fifth thing I learned this year is to wear your [ __ ] retainer I didn't listen to this this year and now my teeth are crooked again and I had braces for five years so I'm paying what some people would call a huge price let's keep working ladies sorry I'm jumping all around the place with this video but at least was starting out 2019 kind of in a bad place so that we can only go from here qe I'm lucky doing good so far I'm kind of getting nervous because well it's something then the pressures on next one who using James Charles morphe palette thank you James Sothis and P are they putting the sandwich back to what I learned this year because that's what we're doing I don't really know where I'm going with this I'm kind of distracted honestly okay so I did a bad job on the freckles whatever another thing I learned this year pick your friends up from the airport why because then they'll pick you up from the airport clean groomed eyebrows have left the [ __ ] chat I'm kind of trying to look like the Grinch on accident I'm kind of scared bored of am i doing a good how do these girls [ __ ] do this [ __ ] Manning like another thing that I learned this year is that dairy is so [ __ ] bad it's bad for your skin it's bad for your stomach pain it just makes everything worse is it sad yes do I want a quesadilla of course I want a quesadilla oh it's [ __ ] weird oh my god he spilled glitter [ __ ] everywhere oh another thing I learned this year breakfast burritos another thing I learned avoid mono this year I got mono and it was disgustingly awful do not drink out of anybody else's glass don't ever kiss anyone I don't care if you have a boyfriend I literally don't oh this is important acrylic nails are not [ __ ] worth it I know that they look pretty and I know that you think that it's a good idea well let me be the first to tell you that it's not a good idea in that acrylic nails are the reason for my depression my acrylic nails for like probably six months I just kept getting em refill refill feel free filled whatever and I never let my nails breathe well fast-forward to now my nails started to die on me I was going to the salon and every time they were putting their nails on I would literally have the worst pain in my hands like my nails were literally constantly throbbing so one day I was sick of it and I was like I don't even care about having acrylics anymore and I had bruises under my acrylics I think it's because they were so long they kept banging into stuff but this one had bruises under all my nails I'm sick of it I was like I don't even want to go back to the salon because they just made the pain in my hands worse so I'm just going to take them off myself well this was a mistake because as you can see it ripped my nails completely off like my nail cuts off right here in my hands look awful it looks like I bite my nails down to the [ __ ] end it looks so bad and the problem is is that like it's not my fault it's been upsetting can my eye look it's kind of random and stupid but my macaroni it's not macaroni okay a few more things on my legs but [ __ ] reading those because I'm really sick of it and no one's entertained by those anyway so let's do winged eyeliner instead I don't I can't so that's it's gonna be [ __ ] okay what even brandies this eyeliner I think I got this forever 21 that's like really really promising not even a word on promising holy [ __ ] it is oh my gosh Wow Leavitt goes to my apartment that's the best winged eyeliner ever done 2019 is good 20 good [ __ ] there's always that one uh you know oh wait [ __ ] holy [ __ ] that's disgusting it looks like a [ __ ] spaceship I feel bad for myself like it's this is like really sad and I don't even have like fake eyelashes or anything to like spikes that [ __ ] up like this is just kind of what its gonna be like do you know what this is this whole thing is just a deer makeup tutorial this is a Bambi makeup tutorial wait who did I just look like Bill Veck pee-wee Herman Mickey Mouse dressed up who is dressed up like an animal oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god it's something with dr. Seuss I think wait wait wait oh my god boyfriend my mascara and why am I trying to do a [ __ ] montage right now I think the problem with me and things that are related to art I've never had the patience to do it it always starts out really good and then by the end it's just really bad and that's why I only did art freshman year when it was easy and then dropped out the second year because the teacher actually started to care not good maybe I just have a short attention span I'm not doing this again I don't really look good we didn't expect that I don't want me to look like a little bit more majestic than usual didn't really succeed with that overall this video might also go on the scrap pile but if you saw it that means there's something okay in it okay bye [Music] you [Music]

the book of Meteorology I'm going to give it to my brother so he doesn't make us look dumb public publicly anymore because he said he had never seen clouds like this hard eyes before but it was smoke

have another five minutes and go [ __ ] grab stupid matching sweaters and I'll even offer to venmo under the table cuz there's a few roadblocks here number one we're late number two were filming and so they might not even let us film okay in my defense I did call the Santa booth and they didn't answer because I wanted to ask if I was allowed to film but they didn't answer so I was like guess we just have to take a big fat Christmas risk and if you guys continue watching this vlog you'll figure out if we ended up being able to film with Santa and we'll continue watching if you want to know if it happened you're not sorry my tongue has coffee on it looks like brown subscribe I promise my on a good day for this [ __ ] okay we're here did you actually throw up what oh my god why you're

-emma chamberlain",2018-12-05T01:28:30Z,416835,8611015,30172,hi can you not hairspray well I'm trying to film a [ __ ] video I promise you I'm not mean to my mom literally here's proof I might mean to you so this video is so I'm scared because oh this is scary but this morning I literally woke up and I was like okay I'm gonna get a nose piercing day I've wanted a little hoop around my nose for a while now because I've seen a few people with them and they're really cute uh that's it there's no deep explanation I'm not a big piercing girl like I literally just have the one little holes on each ear but I have very high pain tolerance and I'm ready for a good time I'm 17 so my mom is in town this is actually where I wanted to do this you have to have a parental guardian with you it's like your actual parent my mom's here say I hi thank you do you approve yeah my mom thinks it'll be cute so I hope it looks good if it doesn't I'm gonna be disappointed I worry that getting a nose piercing will overpower my nose I'm getting a little bit bold here getting out of hoop because if I got a stud those really barely noticeable at all but I want a hoop so little girls not to get what she wants it's not gonna be that big of a deal so I'm not that scared anyway that's it for today I don't know if they're gonna let me fill in there so if they don't then like sorry in advance but if they do then it's our trade so I think it'll make me look a little bit edgy like it'll give me like a little edgy edge Jenin I mean can I stop with you [Music] you think like doing it on my good side for photos is a better option last night we will do a quick thing [Music] nice and clean [Music] my eyes are watering Wow followed my eyes watering them it's done confused because I like it looks a little bit irritated so let's not look too close I like it but I kind of also hate it so I'm trying to figure out where I'm at on that spectrum right now I feel like from the front it looks a little bit weird but like from the side like it looks good does this even match my personality I feel like I'm very natural anything like this is kind of like a little bit much I kind of don't like it if I couldn't take this out I'd be freaking out right now it's not a big deal it's also bleeding a little bit wow that looks like it hurted coming down below if I look cute sorry I was seeing a thumbnail I know you guys probably wanted me to like freak out in the piercing chair but I didn't really care that much I'm an humble of you think I would not be with it I don't know if it's like it's the right vibe know what though everything is what you make of it like this is a vibe I make it about I make it my vibe wish me luck [Music] it's a few days later little nose-ring update my nose is extremely Cressy and infected don't tell my mom I have not probably been cleaning in as well as I should be I mean overall though we're doing pretty good you know I've been living with this nose ring for a few days and a few things number one I actually really like it I hate it at first but I ended up changing my mind and I now liked it so that's good but even though I like it there's still an issue with it and the issue is that I don't really feel like it matches me like personality wise maybe but style wise not really and it's been bothering me today I decided that I would go shopping and I thought I'd give myself a little makeup I don't know I mean this is a new part of my body and I love it and I accept it but I need to embrace it with open arms and change myself to match it let's do it have some fun on that note let's give ourselves a makeover shall we also buy my merch if you are so sorry the first thing that needs to be changed is my outfit because right now I'm wearing pajamas and my merch in Converse it's just not a look right now so let me just get naked and then change sorry I'm getting naked the way that people with nose-rings dress is a little bit more on the angsty goth side that's not what I'm going for today resorting out of this turtleneck but I don't feel like this turn alike is really angsty enough because I wear turtlenecks normally I have a bubble-maker sorry but I feel yummy spice it up and I have just something to do that huh oh god that is this oh god wait let's take all right [ __ ] how are we feeling I'm wearing a shirt that says Slipknot on it which to my knowledge is a rock wait I don't even know what their music sounds like let's find out but these black cargo e pants as you can see and these are great now don't get me wrong but I wear these normally so I thought I needed to spice it out so how the [ __ ] do I open this oh okay look [ __ ] do I get this off oh how I regretted that that just totally hurted me how I literally hurt my tooth so bad Wow hi chime in with my clothing the dogs and it's working belt is a success it's a little bit big for me but I never heard nobody I look great next thing I'm barefoot that's not right oh my god I'm never eating before a video again this is like disgusting another thing that I already own we have these I also own these because I like them for the best I'm sorry they fit if the shoe fits Oh wear it let's do it oh wow okay [Music] amazing I'm really excited holy [ __ ] Wow I've been looking okay Loki though this outfits kind of fashionable and it matches a nose ring like I kind of snapped with this like I literally swear to god oh my god I look like Snape right now so thanks Nate I thought it would be good to do some accessorizing because accessorizing is something that really takes everything to the next level always so first I got these gloves mmm spoopy sorry no that looks awful okay I'm taking off these [ __ ] gloves until I'm ready to wear them cuz they are not comfortable oh do I have to braid my hair right now to put it in this beanie [ __ ] why do I have any issues let me just break my teeth real quick oh I hate that every time amazing I didn't expect to like how this outfit made me feel but I'm kind of enjoying this I don't know I'll say about these necklaces ain't opening packaging this is such an inconvenience for everybody how the [ __ ] am I supposed to open that if you want to go back to that well now it's pissing down oh this is fun see this necklace it's [ __ ] fun oh my god I can't open this [ __ ] packaging my nails are too long can I tell you this is off topic but my nails are long as [ __ ] why because I don't know it's probably some sort of coping mechanism for me oh my god this looks great Wow what even is on this hey what does open up what Wow great necklace anyway my nails get the way of everything like today when rock climbing could not [ __ ] climb [ __ ] because of these [ __ ] house you know when you're putting your credit card into the pay meter when you're trying to pay for parking cannot get the card out one time I literally had my card stuck in a parking meter for literally 15 minutes and I was freaking the [ __ ] out I was literally tempted to ask somebody who's walking by on the street take out my card for me I can't fit my nails I can barely wipe my ass with these things anyway back to the real video I got this bracelet that's black and I didn't even read it until I just got home and it says sorry I'm awkward so [Music] that's fine uh-oh I got this this is actually cool and I actually will wear this in real life oh wow actually like this I'm gonna wear it I [ __ ] with this i chime in with a haven't you people ever another cool addition I bought this Metallica dog tag because should I leave that in how the [ __ ] do I get through my head okay that's sick Hey oh my god I bought this this is fun this is really fun so I bought these earrings that are literally insane you'll see let me just get it in first oh look at that [ __ ] fun thank you can't even see the earrings because of my beanie but whatever [ __ ] it it's the thought that counts oh sorry I'm not gonna stop anytime soon I bought a bunch of pins as a joke and then I realized when I got home that none of them were funny but I'll show you them anyways I got this Panic at the Disco pin because I actually like panic at the disco a little bit and I feel like people who have nose-rings also like pinning at the disco you know the song nine in the afternoon that should [ __ ] slap thank you this one's [ __ ] exceed says I hate you the least because if you didn't already know people who are nose-rings hate everyone we're just different we're not like everybody else so this one's [ __ ] crazy don't give a heck [ __ ] yeah you get a nose ring you don't give a hat you're [ __ ] rebelling against what society says to do which society says don't [ __ ] do that I'm all about fitness entire pizza in my mouth that's not going on my shirt that's too embarrassing this one said many puns later lol not wearing that one the last one is just a great message I hate drugs it's true kids skip nose rings but don't do drugs I'm a role model okay now it's time to start the makeup I'm really excited about this the most important thing that I bought was black lipstick because that's just an obvious staple I keep [ __ ] farting oh God oh my god I'm scared [ __ ] I [ __ ] up okay so next we have to do an eyeshadow look using James Charles morphe palette thank you James I love you no I don't know what I'm doing i chime in with a haven't you people closing the goddamn door why does this look kind of good I shadow is done oh my god I'm so pale I'm scared yep already failing that oh this is so bad whatever I didn't tell anybody this was gonna be good what the [ __ ] just happened oh yeah buddy that's kind of good [ __ ] now you do the same thing on the other eye look at that [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it up dang it whatever oh my then this hard sorry I'm not talking I'm just focusing gay Wow wow he got my eye what am I doing with my life oh my god Wow okay [Music] what the [ __ ] am i doing [Music] yeah problem-solve [Music]

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2018-11-29T20:58:19Z,406388,9089677,20155,um I avoided doing this video because I thought that it would be boring and there's a decent chance that it will be bored I think it probably some of the others requested this I mean I'm nervous there's a lot to cover here don't closer you live too late come okay god I mean you know yeah I'll start paying you better attention thank you yeah you're not doing good so far this light switch there's two of them one of them turns almost like the other one turns on and off the outlets over there it turns off my computer which is a problem because when people come in and turn on this light or at least attempt to turn on that light sometimes I'll turn on this switch which turns off my computer if you like to restart my old computer my mom was almost just tripped over the lamp and she's knocked her hand lamp and I'm uncomfortable though laughs that my mom just hurt herself on is this lamp I got from Ikea the only reason I bought it is because it looks like the Pixar lamp and I thought that was kind of funny and then you have this sitting area that no one [ __ ] uses I don't think I've ever seen someone sit in this corner on that one Emma because I designed this whole apartment so if you don't like it don't tell me because it's gonna hurt my feelings get my work area funny sorry you don't actually really work in this area anymore because I'd like to do my subway are you even showing me right now yeah because I like to do my work in my day on my laptop I don't even really use this thing anymore or whatever Kong this is my banana light no one [ __ ] cares gay there's a chair I put this together by myself and it was so difficult that I actually like almost broke it nine times while trying to build it because I had to hold this and sit on it to like lock it into place or whatever got my leg all tangled up in it and fell over it was really bad okay I have a printer and I don't know how to use my mom told me to get it I haven't figured out a way to use it since this is where I keep all my camera equipment which is a lot I don't really need equipment for my videos because I put the least amount of effort in as possible and then over here why the [ __ ] do whatever okay funny story over here I have my home phone you can show me I'm more important than the home phone why do I have my phone me mask it's because look around everyone come back to me now this is gonna be a long video there's no connection in here so if you want to call anyone you have to use Wi-Fi calling like Wi-Fi says calling for you can use the home phone my mom likes to use that when I don't wake up in the morning and she has to like call me to wake me up it's like a little DIY along the way of going I have a stupid chick I have my polaroid wall but all of the qual words are falling off because this sticky stuff that I use didn't work that well apparently maybe one day I'll hang them back up again I also have cranberry gummies cuz you never know when you're gonna get a UTI it's more than you would expect here's my first meal there's actually many more to come this one is for my Kevin it's amazing by the way most of my furniture is from Urban Outfitters yeah here's my living room I actually don't have a TV look at what's across from me no television because television rots your brain and so I do wrong what I do have this yellow couch 100 my friends i leaked period blood onto this couch yo you are and it actually cleaned off to her easily so that was kind of good i'm pretty proud about this rug is completely dirty because it's white so don't ever buy white rug because it's gonna get dirty in two minutes coffee table book about coffee which I think what do you guys said to me so thank you for that posters which is stupid because this is an acrylic table do you don't even need to have [ __ ] coasters on it and I have posters anyway because I think it looks cute you can come closer and like show the stuff like you're just like standing over there then we have these chairs which I also built myself it was so hard to build these chairs but I did this is such a cute [ __ ] the pillow this is not a cute [ __ ] pillow this is the cutest pillow I've ever seen it's so [ __ ] cute where's none of your business just kidding it's from world market look I hate that story I hate world mark yeah that was target no that's real world market hmm I don't I think who cares maybe that was from targeted views from Target figure it out yourself and I have this pillow from Urban Outfitters and I personally don't really like that this says words on it I think it's a little bit cliche so sometimes I like to turn it around when I want to feel like a real woman what I don't leave blankets in this but where are they I'm asking you I know they're in my nest sorry so my nest okay we're not gonna tell what the nest is cuz that's just got a weird they're not gonna get it okay that's not just kind of weird it ought to make you look weird there used to be blankets in that but there's not anymore disappeared combust it into thin air not to us it doesn't dissipate it something it disappeared but there usually is fluffy blanket than here so sorry this is a very cute pillow I bought so many pillows when I moved here and I used 1/4 of them so these are all the ones that made the cut I don't know why now that's still out because I don't even like that one that's me of this this is something that my mom told me I had to buy and I didn't really want to but now that's here it was even in this like I don't [ __ ] know who gives a [ __ ] you know it's just stupid [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] these are just things that my dad got for me and I have like little [ __ ] if you sue and it's more about this which I thought was just like a little artistic addiction that's it I decided it's like kind of like quirky of me cuz like that's for like an art class but I got it for a decoration this is my next mirror this mountain here is a little bit wonky because it makes you look taller bed bar which is really not a problem cuz I wish I was taller I'm only 5 5 4 maybe I'm 5 6 now what do you think pretty close okay watch out guys I'm going through puberty a little bit late but I'm still going through it so next we have this I do not have any good decorations for this yet whatsoever like this is not good we have a speaker me I'm like this little thing made of books and magazines like water can why do I have that I don't know I don't have anything to water wait yes I do but I don't want this you think I wanted us [ __ ] now I do I've never longer those a day in my damn life not gonna do it anytime soon then I have a trash can with these things in it and I want to use this that this is a trash can but I can't because I don't have a [ __ ] vase for that yet and I have to just wait around and put it in the [ __ ] trashcan for now then I have this rug that really pisses me off it's all great shapes and everything right and then it just has a black edge like you see though saying like this edge is just flat so I think it's meant to go against a wall but the thing is like it doesn't look like it's like then I have this tool that I was gonna use her upstairs at my vanity but I ended up not using it because it was really uncomfortable and not the right height that's annoying under there is all the [ __ ] that I don't want people to see well I don't want people to see it so I'm not it's trash and other [ __ ] that I'm not using so I'm just gonna blur all that out you don't even know what's over there it's my little Harry Potter under the stairs moment even though I feel kind of out saying that cos like that says that Harry Potter was like not wanting other the stairs but like I love Harry Potter and I feel like she was wanted in my heart I'm saying that makes sense I love Harry Potter oh oh I have this clock loved so much I don't even know this is on the right time and it wouldn't matter anyway because I don't know how to read this kind of clock because I was born in 2001 he never had to learn how to read those oh here's my fire alas it goes off literally what the day I'm not giving once a day no one knows why one time I was having a sleepover with all my buddies all my buddies there was like two of us here not really a lot of buddies and the fire alarm went off at 5 a.m. and we all had to go outside so that was really [ __ ] annoying who's there wasn't gonna fire and the fire alarm went off for 20 minutes but it's ok because I'm grateful because I'd rather be overly sensitive than not sensitive enough you know right ok this is my fridge I don't like showing you my fridge I guess I can show this I just don't like I feel like fridges are so intimate that's really vulnerable like I'm already showing you my apartment I'm not gonna show you my fridge ok fine I'll show you for a sec when I first moved into this apartment I bought a hundred of these if anyone wants to come over to eat those let me know is I bought too many and I'm sick of them never use that lender before that I probably won't even and on the back way dishwasher all there's dishes in it thank God my mom's visiting because she did that I didn't no one cares like this [ __ ] let me find unclean like no here's my trash cans I don't take them out a lot I'm really trying to get good at being my own garbage compressor where I will take the garbage out and I'll start something like really hard until it finds out until the tiny little tiny little Club and then I just keep playing around first I think I just found out that I have this didn't know I had that boring boring boring boring Oh what is this is this my merch [ __ ] it's used today totally under the video I'm going to announce you know that I'm selling now I guess it will then stay tuned if you want to know about it [Music] now I have a Polaroid frame but I don't have Polaroids in his I'm too lazy table I eat on this no chance have you even seen paintings around my house because my dad came to them because my dad is an artist so these are his paintings they're really good here's another one they're [ __ ] everywhere this is my closet this cause it's kind of a [ __ ] that's so much [ __ ] in here all my [ __ ] jackets as you can probably tell I have an addiction to jackets I like

-emma chamberlain",2018-11-24T20:00:50Z,415634,5462459,21208,"This is why I don't... *sighs* this is why I don't upload that much *gucci western music enters* It all starts with me filming a video. Ya know, what youtubers do. Usually I'm feeling good, I'm feeling pumped, I'm excited! I'm inspired to be filming a video. And I'm like, yeah! This is the week where I start uploading consistently. This is THE WEEK! I'm fucking ready! Little do I know though what's coming next. Once I'm finished filming I usually start editing immediately because I'm feeling so freaking inspired that I don't even know what else to do with my life I have no option but to start editing. I feel productive. I feel good. I feel ready I'm excited. For the first couple of days of editing, it's easy. It's fun. I'm enjoying it, I'll spend hours in a day editing and it feels like nothing. It'll literally feel like it's what my body was meant to do BUT since my videos take like, 30 hours to edit, I quickly start to feel like it will never end not to mention I'm getting sick of the video that I'm editing because I've had to watch it so many different times that I start to think that nothing about it is entertaining, funny uh ... worth watching whatsoever Basically, I start hating it. By the third or fourth day of editing, things are definitely going south. I start to realize that I'm running out of time. because my goal is always to upload once a week So if I upload it on a Sunday the week before, my goal is to upload the next Sunday But by my third or fourth day of editing I realize that that's not ... ... ... going to probably happen realistically. Unless I pull a few all-nighters or do nothing fun with my life except for editing for the next few days. Sadly, I can't remember the last time I uploaded on time. It's also f**ked up because it's a schedule I put into my own mind I never say 'oh, hey guys, I upload once a week' I upload whenever I want, but my goal is always to upload once a week because I have this kind of 'mental calendar' or mental kind of schedule. when I don't fulfill it, it makes me feel like a fucking loser. :( I start getting so anxious about the fact that I'm not gonna finish the video that I basically have a meltdown like basically a temper tantrum what you had when you were a toddler and stuff like I'm like that 
my relationship with editing starts getting SO toxic that I literally just CAN't do it. And because I'm not editing and doing what I know I should be doing I start HATIng myself. It makes my self-esteem PLuMMET. So let's talk about the temper tantrum, obviously I'm crying because I'm a sensitive ass bitch and crying is one of my favorite hobbies Anyway, if you've ever cried before, you know (gentle lip lick) how it fucking goes: once you start crying about one thing you start crying about EVERYTHING that's going on in your life and you can't stop usually to try to get the crying to stop I'll call my parents and try to talk it out with them So I'll be like hey guys. This is what's f**king going on. Again. This is happening again, umm and I'm crying and erram Yea, the crying goes on for a 'few hours', usually sometimes two sometimes four. I feel bad for my parents honestly, I don't know how they deal with me, but eventually I start to see the light at the end of the tunnel and I start to feel better and iiii start recovering from my f**king meltdown :) But obviously I have to try to find ways to make myself feel better because it's not gonna just mend itself okay?? I have to try to find stuff that'll distract me and make me love my life again, basically, uHHH eh Sorry, this is getting kind of dark but it's not that big of a deal. I promise :D here are some of the things that I do to make myself feel better number one
I clean a lot I do this when I feel shitty because it makes me feel productive ...even though I'm not actually doing what I'm supposed to be doing which is editing and working, it allows me to basically just do a responsibility while also avoiding responsibilities it's really kind of dark but it helps
it gets the point where I'm literally cleaning and organizing stuff that doesn't really need to be organized or cleaned But at least it just makes me feel kind of good (bless) and if you think about it It could be a LOT worse. I could literally be snorting f**king coke, (not today bitch) so I don't know I'm not complaining. Another thing I've done before is try to find a f**king hobby. like the other day I went to Walmart and got a skateboard for fun. I don't know I was like this could be good for me?!? So I bought a penny board and I just started skating around in my garage. I'm not good at it But as I said before it's better than snorting coke. Another thing is I go hang out with friends. Right now that is not an option in my life because they're all out of town *sadface* So I'm just
chillin by myself and skateboarding in my f**king garage. I don't know *whoops*
It's kind of sad :another
thing: I'm not really proud of this one, 
but I do a lot of online shopping It also explains why I have soo many clothes and I don't really need them ... err but I want them One of my biggest things that I do is 
I just take naps. After you have like a f**king meltdown There's nothing better than taking a nap when you cry really good and then you sleep really good that shit, it's f**king... That's some shit right there. 
That's some good shit right there The last thing that I can think of for now
is taking a walk... I've never really done this before when having a meltdown, but I had one like two days ago, and I just decided I would take a walk because I didn't want to be in my apartment anymore So I walked over to 7-eleven and got a coconut water. And I mean I.. enjoyed my experience... it was a nice day out got some fresh air some creepy old man on the bike started talking to me and harassing me and I didn't like that but I got out of that situation pretty easily. So it was no big deal I mean at least someone talked to me, you know what I mean? Anyway after I do a few of those activities and make myself feel better. My mood is usually kind of back up It usually takes about two days and then I'm feeling good again. And it's time to try again at this point There's two ways that things can go - number one
I finish editing the video that I initially wanted to edit and I feel amazing even though I uploaded it probably later than I wanted to actually, definitely later than I wanted to
 at least it's up and I feel F**king great but sometimes it's not that easy aaand I'm so sick of the video that I was originally editing that I delete ALL OF IT and act like it never happened this SUcks because usually at this point I've already put about twenty hours into a video that now is deleted BUT it doesn't matter to me because I'm not inspired by the video anymore and so working on it would just make me even more depressed So, SORRY that was so dark uuuu uuum oooo I didn't really expect it to be like thissss, but I'm being honest. That's the answer though. 
That's *why* I don't upload that much (roll credits) I'm doing my best though, and I'm getting better 
and I'm trying to figure out solutions find a system that works for me So that I can do all this while having a good mindset 
as much as possible Obviouslyyy, you're not gonna be good all the time. You're not gonna feel good all the time There's gonna be times when you're discouraged or you feel like you don't love what you're doing Even though at the end of the day you Do love what you're doing It's all about finding a balance in figuring it out for yourself. I'm figuring it out. I'm figuring it out! Although I can't get videos up as much as I PERSONALLY want to because at the end of the day It's what YOU want to do. You got to do it for yourself and that's something I'm learning I have to be making these videos cuz I enjoy watching them and cuz I enjoy making them I don't know if that makes sense But whatever.. at the end of the day though - I'm always proud of the video that I post So even if I didn't post it on time Or I took a longer break than I wanted or my 'meltdown' was a little bit worse than usual at the end of the day The videos that I put out are videos that I'm proud of and that's.... the fucking tea sis ;) Anyway, thank YOU for supporting me even though I'm a fucking mess. I'm a mess Like I mean, ok, like what is this video? This video is just me explaining how I'm a mess basically, but that's okay cuz that's what weee signed up for This is what we signed up for. I didn't know I was gonna be like this when I was born I didn't choose this life. It chose me the meltdown life F**king chose me, but I appreciate you <3 for supporting me throughout my growth process and trying to figure out everything and
I don't think I'll ever figure it out because I just think that the way that I do best is being a little bit of a mess I think that if you're at your full creative potential you're gonna wanna diE half the time I don't know. Maybe that's not true. 
Whatever. I appreciate you a lot I already said that but I'm saying it again 
cuz I don't know I'm not good at verbalizing my love for people probably because I have past trauma in my life, but that's beside the point But I'm gonna fucking stop being a pussy and I'm gonna tell you that I love you, and I appreciate you and I'm very grateful for you <33 I wanted to start thanking you more but I realized ok now is just overkill. So I'm just gonna stop now. Okay? BYE? I made this in a very short amount of time because I got this idea while I was getting my nails done today and Then I was like
f**k it I just need to make this video before I have another meltdown and I can say that so far, I've not had a meltdown yet (bless) 
So I think I'm doing pretty good right now That's it, and I'll see you in God knows how fucking long because we all know that I can't get a video up consistently so maybe see you in two weeks, 
maybe i'll see you in like four days who f**king knows! I love you, k bye <3 *peaceful techno music* x caption authors linked in bio x smash subscribe if you're new join us ohhh blueeee have a great day peace"

doing a new tutorial because you don't care about when I do on my face because I never looked at with makeup so I'm not gonna talk about it I'm just gonna do it and then talk to you about my feelings as I do it I don't have anything to say enough to now pull something out of my ass oh yeah it's like 3 p.m. right now we didn't really do anything yet today except for postmates and I took like four different separate ships so I'm gonna start on my thing on deodorant because I didn't shower so I have to do something hi everybody come in armpits out already this is so beer I've never quit deodorant on somebody in my life perfect let me give you some festival advice if you guys have never gone to one before because you know like that maybe that's why you're watching this videos because you want to know what festivals are like well this is my second festival or you might third I went to Coachella and then I went to it I'll say lives in San Francisco and then now I'm here at tropically or tropicale yeah I don't know how to say it basically here's how festivals work idea of the festival is gonna be a lot funner than the actual thing itself guys do you have any concert advice okay dehydration will ruin your entire day and I would know because I'm constantly be hydrated when you're something like this you would expect okay I'm hearing the artists that I love so much I want to be in the front of the crowd you still can't see them you are being crowded by bodies of people that aren't wearing deodorant instead sit on the side in the shade if there's no grass and just [ __ ] deal with it and sit on the cement being comfortable is way more enjoyable than being at the front seeing nothing more than you would if you were sitting in the back so that's the TV unless you like mosh pits which personally I actually care about myself so I don't the lines for everything like food are really long maybe bring a little bar for yourself you're enhancing you can bring outside food and take that back don't bring any food in unless you really want you to then you can just shove things up your shut things up all of your orifices you have the fuel's down there that you can work with I'm doing my mascara I can't talk right now Oh everybody you can't talk I don't wanna wait has anybody taken a shower yet because I good well I don't shower except for like once a year so I personally have not showered in the shower and I probably won't and I'll probably just wait till I get home to shower because my 19 is go get home and you um shower and I'll best-suited I'm building my immune system also because I'm lazy also because what you don't wash your hair a lot your hair is healthier so moral story is joke's on you because I'm the one botero´s gonna be taking lucious and I'm never gonna go bald I'm about to contour my face in the worst way possible because I did not bring it on for a brush I don't contour MSM pale oh my god I don't know how to do this oh that's a little bit too dark just blend just keep blending I know what I'm doing I'm scared of how much I don't know what I'm doing like it's crazy like when I first heard of make youtube I was like I'll just be a beauty youtuber [ __ ] things are getting dark and to be on there I'm not down for it I don't want to see the moon when I wake up at 11 a.m. I don't look so good right now no good I

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2018-10-28T19:33:03Z,268501,5934372,11194,okay so before this video starts let's talk about a few things that are boring but I feel like I have to get them out of the way it's like on the beginning of the class and the teachers like first let me tell you that my dog died last night so that you can understand why I yell at all the students in class you know I was really good it's like when the teacher starts out the class is like today there's a pop quiz it's information that like he didn't really need to know because it was gonna happen anyway but then you know it now that didn't really even make any sense with this scenario as to what's going on right now but I already said it so I can't take it back okay so number one the beginning of this video I am so drained and tired that I seem like a corpse by the way you know that it gets better but I had to leave it in because it's the intro of my video so deal with it another thing you're probably like Emma you never upload any more and that's because so yeah but this time there's actually a reason and it's because for the past nine days I've had a fever for some context I went to the emergency room two nights ago and was there from 2:00 a.m. to 6 a.m. and it was so fun I loved it I had an amazing time and it was super cool and I'm not disturbing and upsetting at all thank you so much and then last night I threw up like 4 times or like twice so I'm not gonna exaggerate it was only twice but it felt like four times yeah a diarrhea sorry I went to the doctor today and they said they think I'm a virus so just letting you know that if I've been a little bit m.i.a recently that's why because my body is failing and I feel awful thank you for listening let's watch the video hopefully you like it and I love you regardless even if you hate it okay enjoy I just throw up a little bit [Music] so if you can't tell by the change in setting and the objects in my arm I'm home so I'm visiting home right now San Francisco not actually San Francisco but near it says where my parents live and every once in a while I come back here to visit remind myself of all the traumatic things that happened to me well I'm referring to middle school because middle school is [ __ ] awful actually Johnston was high school I get to go to my favorite restaurant stuff like that go to doctors appointments mostly I'm still underage so all my doctor's appointments are here I look awful right now I am so pale I need to fake tan I know I'm pale right now it's not cute it looks bad I look only good when I'm tan it's just science I don't it's not up to me for now this is what we're getting actually it's some tanning loose I actually had some tanning mists left at this apartment my mom's apartment here where I am right now but it actually expired in 2017 like since when does [ __ ] tanning mousse expire I don't know but anyway I got here last night I'm at like midnight and I woke up this morning at 8:30 a.m. right and early I can't believe I did I've never woken up that early in my [ __ ] life but yeah pretty excited about that got a nice coffee I used to get coffee here all the time when I lived here really

can continue the video done funny story I was walking back from the coffee shop back to my apartment and I was walking past this grocery store and all of a sudden I hear somebody say ha ha and I was like what and I like couldn't see who was saying it and I looked around and I was like the [ __ ] ok whatever and I just kept walking and then I heard and I was like what the [ __ ] so I turn around and it's an old man and I was like oh what he was like did you get me one and I was like what he was like a coffee because I was holding my coffee and I was like uh no he was like don't forget about me next time and I was like what the [ __ ] are you talking about what do you mean he's like get me a coffee next time it go don't don't stop make sure to think of me and I was like ok like alright make sure to get you one next time and he was like that's what everyone says but nobody actually gets me one and I'm like I don't know where you live ok order like this joke has gone too far we were supposed to humor each other you were supposed to be like get mehron next time and I was supposed to be like ok well ha ha and then you were supposed to be like alright sounds good but instead you took it way too far and you're like that's what everybody says don't start [ __ ] putting your personal issues on me this is none of my business I'm not getting you a coffee you next time ok this is super weird because when I got back to LA I was in a parking garage and I was valeting my car and I was holding a coffee and the valet guy was like did you get me one that was like I am NOT [ __ ] doing this again I have to go to a dentist I'm in today and hang out with my friends so that's it hope you enjoy my vlog I don't you really vlog that much anymore because I don't know I just happened it recently but I need to get back into it because it's fun for us it's more personal for us you know you get to see what's really it looks so ugly oh my god right now my head looks like the [ __ ] moon you don't want to be on camera do you huh no okay Oh turn that off that is the one thing me my mom don't agree on actually not just the one thing there's a lot of things we don't agree on I don't like country music that's do you like it you want to argue my mom right now is driving me to my dad disappointment you talking loud so that the microphone can pick up what you're saying and then I don't have to do a little subtitle because that's annoying for me what I'm editing I don't want to do that I'll try thank you what are we worried about with this dentist appointment a lot of things cuz I haven't been wearing my retainer which I know is it worth Adonis serie to scream about regardless I think that they're so gonna yell at me because it has to do with my teeth so also I drink a lot of coffee and my teeth are stained and I also don't floss ever like ever we're gonna check in after and see if they what they say about it the odds are not in my favor right now I feel like it's none of their business but I just get scared till they know them to get reprimanded even though funny thing is every single time I'm about to go in I'm like I've been flossing even less than the last time I came in but they never really say they're always like your teeth look good they look even flossing I'm like you know it's serious and then they're like good cuz your teeth look great like no plaque and I'm like because they tell me I don't floss like maybe floss once a week tops they're like oh my god you teeth are so clean it's like off-the-charts clean maybe it's because you let the dogs lick the plaque out of your teeth I don't and then they're like [ __ ] literally my mom hasn't taken a shower in six years because she just lost a dog so I complete him like her off by also I got a haircut how do I look ladies it's nice and short let me know what you think down below in the comments let me know if you think I'm uglier or if you think I'm cuter with it yeah well no right now I'm gonna wear it down later I just have to shower cause you haven't showered in like seven or eight days okay [Music] [Music] my god that's amazing dentist appointment equals completed did they see a cavity nah maybe no I'm perfect I can't believe that just happened again been enough she said that my teeth look great she told me that I might have a cavity forming in the deep depths of my back of my mouth but she said that nothing is for certain and therefore let's just keep living life I'm happy for you thank you it's so awesome day high-five [Music] they gave me big brush started my reward I want a burrito but it's kind of not gonna happen cuz I have stuff to do I have to go home and edit David Dunkin Donuts here no beach what the [ __ ] that's new what happen accidents now that was crazy what'd he do he just like cut me off like I have no idea what his problem was I'm scared I won't let go follow that person Jelena no that's just unnecessary no their husband cheated on them their daughter it didn't get on her world this year it's not their fault that we almost crashed your Subaru I should I get a Subaru for my next car the only thing is are you made fun of for having a Subaru on a daily basis I always have I could get a different car and not get made fun of or you get another Subaru and love it but get made fun of I don't want to get made fun of anymore I'm sick of it I just don't believe it I think no this wasn't here before did you some sort of oh the old people used to eat there wine tasting that's so [ __ ] stupid oh I didn't even think that blind taste testing was like a real thing I thought that was just like something that people do in movies like when they go on dates and [ __ ] I didn't think that actually happened Laurel stories that's we're going for dinner tonight this is starting to freak me out because the things that they opened up are all like touristy why the [ __ ] do they open up a blind taste testing restaurant who the [ __ ] wants to do that on how quickly that'll closed it reminds me of something that you'd see on like a [ __ ] like overpopulated pier why is that happening in my hometown that's triggering look how white my teeth look oh god they look great sweetie oh my god that was gross [Music] oh my god by my zoomed in like that we what the [ __ ] K like mmm hi grace I look like a boy right now I wanna date me and who are

have them oh oh seven vegan I do [Applause] [Music] I'm just gonna go like this till it turns on not moving it until it turns on if it doesn't though insert that thing from Sponge Bob where it's like Eleni Island I was hoping you'd do the voice there oh I don't understand it's just the iPhone X you know the thing on Twitter where it's like you do you take two two cups of rice with water in it and you put one on one into the room and one another under the room and then you talk [ __ ] to one of them jars of rice and then you're nice to the other jar of rice the one that you talk nice to will like be like in good condition and then the one that you talk at the [ __ ] to will like rot around some twitter app because like no that is not a thing okay well does that make sense though yeah I don't like right so I'm not going to test it okay well same but what I'm saying is I'm really nice to my phone right though then maybe it'll turn on I just like want you to know that like I love you

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2018-10-16T22:44:57Z,291055,4627705,17032,"welcome to my bed [Music] so today we're filming in my bed because I am tired and I'm on my period and I'm emotional and I have cramps and I fried four times today I didn't want to sit up to film this because I realized that whether I'm in a bed or I'm sitting in a chair I am still gonna be telling you the same story so let's do it in bed I have a bunch of pimple cream on because they just popped all my blackheads like it's definitely a raw moment but I thought that that was fitting for today's video because it's a very deep and emotional story so I want you to feel like you're talking to me and I also just farted but is quiet so you can't hear it but you can only smell it and that's good as you saw from the title and I'm gonna tell you the story about when I met God now I know you're probably like Emma you didn't and that's partially true the stories I'm gonna tell you today is spiritual it's not really gonna have any significance to you at all it is kind of just like one of those things that isn't really that good of a story and but I thought I'd share it with you because it meant something to me and so the story begins the other day I was walking around Melrose in LA because I'm a basic [ __ ] there's a lot of cool vintage stores and they're all over price for whatever it's a great place to go shopping I was shopping alone now that's weird because I don't like doing things alone back in the day I used to do everything alone literally go shopping alone I'd eat alone do grocery shopping alone I do everything alone recently that hasn't been the case I like to do things with people because it makes me feel more comfortable because think about it like this let's say you're alone and you're walking down the street and all of a sudden a group of powerful eighth graders that are all hanging out walk past you and they all judge you because you're alone that's scary and I like to avoid that but I took the risk and decided to go shopping alone a big [ __ ] step for me I gone into a few stores done a little bit of damage but like not too much recently I've been really obsessed with denim like vintage denim jeans I just been really into jeans recently but I have literally never been able to find good jeans I get a pair of jeans and I'm like okay these are like a nice 8 out of 10 they're fine but they're not great and that's always how it is it's like all my jeans in my closet are like mediocre it's like either they're a little bit big or they're a little bit small or they don't hit the perfect part of my waist there's always some sort of flaw in them and I've come to terms with this I've literally like accepted the fact at this point that I'm never gonna find a pair of jeans that I like ok and it hurted but it's fine because that's just life not everything be perfect well that's what I thought so with this in mind I go into this vintage denim store I was like I need good jeans I've always wanted good jeans maybe today's the day that I'm gonna find good jeans you know my heart deep down kinda knew that there was no chance I knew that there was no chance that I was ever gonna find jeans that were perfect for me and that I was just gonna die wearing an 8 out of 10 pair of jeans I coulda turns with this at this point so I go and I'm sifting through and I find a few pairs of shorts in a few pairs of pants it seemed like they would fit me they're my size like alright see what we can do okay I want to get my coffee we're okay sorry back to work great coffee by the way and I decided to start trying him on now when I first got into the store there was a lot of people in there by the time that I was done picking out all the jeans that I wanted to try on it was just me and the woman working there immediately I felt in my heart that me and this woman who's working at the front desk had a connection but I couldn't exactly explain it I just knew that she understood me in a way that no one else does but I didn't really know what that meant yet but later I would find out I said excuse me miss may I use the restroom she said we don't have a restroom and I said that sucks because I really have to [ __ ] I decided that even though I had to [ __ ] really bad I was going to try on these jeans so I get into the room and I'm trying on the jeans and every pair was like an 8 out of 10 but I was like [ __ ] it they're still kind of cute and all of a sudden the woman says I think that these jeans would look really good on you and she slips them under the door and I was like okay sure so I try them on and they're perfect the 10 out of 10 pair of jeans that I had been waiting for and we're now on my body they were ripped in the perfect spots they were the perfect wash of denim straight out of the 80s maybe the 70s I don't know but they were straight out of a vintage [ __ ] movie perfect jeans fit me like a glove the [ __ ] pockets on the ass were perfect and immediately I look at this woman I come out of the dressing room and I'm like how did you know she was like I just knew and I was like holy [ __ ] this woman is not from Earth this is not somebody that was born normally this is not somebody that was once a sperm in an egg and then became a human being but it doesn't end there at this point she starts giving me hundreds of pairs of jeans I kid you not probably 40 pairs and every single pair that she gave me was a ten fit me perfectly and I was like what is going on I've never experienced this this woman knows all and I was starting to get scared and at this point I'm like not even really worried about the fact that this woman is obviously godly and not normal from [ __ ] earth I was more worried about the fact that I had to [ __ ] stale finally after literally an hour of trying on jeans putting him on thinking that they're perfect putting them in the yes pile putting on another pair thinking that they're perfect putting him in the yes pile coming out of the dressing room being like how are you so good at this me not knowing what in the world is aligned on this fine day that has made this happen after an hour of literally sweating having to [ __ ] and trying on jeans I was done and I had a pile of probably 20 jeans that were perfect I had narrowed it down to 20 but I was like this is going to be at least $2,000 if I buy all these jeans meaning that I have to narrow it down a little bit more I'm picking out at least seven I told myself I was like you're allowed to buy seven which I knew was gonna hurt my bank account but at this point I was like I don't care this woman deserves my bank account she deserves all the money I've ever made she's my god okay I'm sitting in the dressing room and I'm sweating at this point clenching my [ __ ] harder than I've ever clenched it because I still have to [ __ ] mind you and I'm looking through all of these jeans and I narrow it down to seven and it was the hardest thing I've ever done not only are they perfect and beautiful looking but they're also comfortable like what since what our jeans comfortable especially vintage ones especially vintage ones because back in the day jeggings didn't exist these were comfortable vintage I couldn't believe my legs so I come out and I put them on the counter and I'm like all seven and she was like wow I knew it you know I was like how did you know how did you not bring me in one pair that wasn't a 10 she was like oh geez not a feeling and at that moment I knew that the woman that I was speaking to was not just the [ __ ] woman who was put on the 12 to 5 shift this woman was done there's no way that she could know me so well and I spent dollars on jeans but the thing is is that I've never been happier to do something in my life I was thrilled to give her all my money it was my pleasure and just when you thought this woman couldn't get any more perfect she's like we don't normally open our bathroom to the public but I really like you and I feel connected to you so I'm gonna let you use the bathroom I was like okay this is the most perfect woman I've ever met she's kind caring compassionate she remembers things I asked her if I could use the bathroom an hour before she remembered she knew she could feel that while I was trying on all those jeans that I hated poop butt rooting through my ass she knew better than me even at that point I almost forgot I had to [ __ ] cuz I was so infatuated by her godliness but I still did have to [ __ ] so I did and I used her restroom and it was an amazing experience I came out feeling refreshed and I gave her my credit card and then I went home and I continued to think about it for the rest of the day I will forever love this woman like I love her she's like my mom she's my grandma she's my aunt she's my friend she's my mentor and she's my god and that's my story it doesn't really have any significance to anybody but me but I felt like I'd share with you anyways because it was just kind of something that meant a lot to me and I wanted you to know about it because you guys know everything about my life and I thought I would share it with you this video is not over I want to show you the jeans that I bought because why would I not show you I feel like that would just be rude so I'm gonna do a haul I'm gonna call this a god hole because it's not just any haul this is a call that was touched by God herself I hope you enjoyed my story and now let's look at the jeans that I bought I hope you have an amazing day enjoy my jean haul [Music] [Music] [Music] that's all for today that's it goodbye [Music]"

I don't know cause I graduated already, which actually makes it like really kind of like depressing,:( that I'm making this video like, kind of unfair, kind of rude... BUT it's fine. Ha. Ha. You know what? I went to school for like f***ing 11 years, so I already know enough. School's been going on for like a month, y'all are getting all settled in, ya know figuring out who your friends are this year, who you're gonna sit lunch with... *sit with at lunch* ...who your crush is this year, who your favorite teacher is, what your favorite subject is this year, ya know what I mean? You're settling in. You're figuring s*** out. And that's why I thought that I'd really just spring this video upon you right now, because you're really kinda getting balls-deep into it... ...You know what? Let's rephrase. Um, you're really getting into it. You know, you're in your groove now, I would hope. In today's video, I'm going to be doing a lookbook. Now, I know you guys are like,  ""Emma you are not a fashion icon, we did not subscribe to you for that."" And I understand. That's why I'm here to do what no one else is doing. To give you a lookbook that is accurate. An accurate school lookbook. One that is actually... hmm... doable. I feel like all these gals show all these cute ass outfits that they wear to school. But that's not like, realistic. No one actually wears cute outfits like that to school. It's just not how it works. So today I'm gonna be showing you outfits based off of and inspired by the people that you see in school, possibly even you. I don't know if that makes sense, but I don't really care because I already filmed the whole video and you have to watch it. So I hope you enjoy it and I hope you have fun. Let me know if you try out any of these outfits. If you don't that's okay too, because I don't care, it's not really gonna affect me. They're kind of relatable. Alright, enjoy. Have fun. Be yourself. Love yourself. Wow my eyes kinda look pretty right now. That's rare, usually I just look ugly in every aspect of my life, but... Like to try new things... Okay, let's go. *Punkish music* *Depressed music* *Circus music* *Hipster music* *Intense music* *Chill music* *Sexy music* What the f*** am i doing? *Childish music* *Weird music* *Upbeat music* *Crickets* *Orchestra music* *Reverse noise* *Sexy music* *Bing* *Childish music* *Werid piano music* *RIngtone music* *RIP HEADPHONE USERS* Okay, that's it, video is now over, and it's time for you to do whatever you want! Like, now that it's over, it's like, you can do whatever you want. You know what I mean? It's up to you. Do what you've gotta do. If you've gotta do some homework? Do it. Gotta go eat dinner with the fam? Do it. Gonna go have a sleepover with the buds? Do it! I don't care, cause the video's over. Alright, *kiss noise* BYEEE!"

-emma chamberlain",2018-09-27T22:43:10Z,392182,10366438,22448,oh my god oh you know my car garage didn't realize that I forgot my [ __ ] car key because it wasn't connected to my [ __ ] keys okay I literally left my coffee on the hood of the car imagine if I would have driven away though it in so funny okay hi how are you oh my god I'm so glad recently I've been having an issue I've become dependent on something that is not good for me I've been post mating every meal I'm not kidding most people are like yeah I personally like every meal and that means that they pose me like one meal a week and they think that they're being [ __ ] wild I have been post mating every single meal of my day for like a month and a half like I have not gone grocery shopping in probably two and a half months maybe even three I [ __ ] don't remember what it's like to cook a meal like I've eaten make myself cereal I will post meat cereal today that's going to change I feel myself then that stage of my life is over I am NOT going to be a postmates [ __ ] anymore it's time for me to start cooking for myself again I was like wifey material I'm starting to stray away from life material more and more everyday every single time I post made something I'm less wifey material it's time to get back in the kitchen [ __ ] oh my god my car is making such a weird sound because there's a piece of plastic that's like dragging under my car let's see if you can hear it do you hear that that's literally a piece of plastic from my [ __ ] car that's dragging on the ground and preventing me from living my best life but the other day has a great ingenious and fun idea that me and you would cook a nice wifey as [ __ ] meal for myself because at the end of the day you're your own wife you know what I'm saying that's some big T right there since it's time to go to the grocery store because sorry but I don't have groceries look at this lading so bad you'll turn my exposure down I don't know how to work a camera that better that's worse um I gave up today we're gonna be making vegan mac and cheese and a Greek salad because both of those things sound really good to me although I don't think normally you would eat those two things together but does it look like I care it's actually kind of ironic because I'm literally making vegan mac and cheese and then the Greek salad has feta cheese on it I'm not gonna be using vegan feta cheese because feta cheese shut up I love feta cheese so much that I'm just gonna eat normal feta cheese so like why am i making vegan mac and cheese you may ask I really don't know and I don't have a reason that's what's on the menu tonight I'm making everything from scratch except I'm making the pasta from scratch because I'm not a [ __ ] genius like let's not get too ahead of ourselves here there's a lot of room for error here and am i worried of course I'm worried because I have a very low IQ you know you move to LA and everyone's like don't get it opposed mates like [ __ ] that [ __ ] will [ __ ] you up and then everyone's like no and then you get to LA and you're like and then life just starts crumbling down from there but I mean it's that [ __ ] simple that's what we're doing today hope you guys are excited I am my long straw that is reusable because I care about turtles no-nobody oh my god you hear that oh yeah let's go grocery shopping oh my god I'm so embarrassed the piece of plastic gonna meet my car that's dragging on the ground is so loud in all the cars next to me are [ __ ] staring at me like laughing ah me because they're like what the [ __ ] is wrong with this [ __ ] in her car I'm just excited to be part to some this [ __ ] nightmare is over I'm literally traumatized and I also don't know where the grocery store is and I'm really confused because it says I'm here oh it's right there and I just packed it you [ __ ] me that sorry I need a bunch of spices for my salad dressing and all of the [ __ ] spice containers are humongous like I don't need this much its chipotle powder like a seasoning because they just went to the seasoning aisle and like they didn't have to put like powder or like what even does that mean like should I get paprika instead they literally have like bacon bits but they don't have [ __ ] Chipotle powder paprika is just gonna have to work for this [Music] let's do it first step is to make the pasta now that's not hard but I'm intimidated it's gonna be okay good I don't even turn this on why do I forget how to boil water it's been a while I'm supposed to put a little bit of salt into my water why oh I don't know I don't create the rules it's not up to me well so I know the lighting is bad but I couldn't fit a ring light right there so we're just gonna look dark in it it never says how much paucity is so I think I'm just gonna make the whole box whoops this is elbows which is like half inch it's okay even though I don't even really like the taste of macaroni shaped pasta even though a lot of lard is it all prostitute the same but I disagree I'd make to pee a little bit but I'm kind of busy okay now I need to find my saucepan I don't know where anything in my apartment is I literally don't know what pan is you can't really see my pot right here my pan right here and I'm sorry about it it's not my phone heat oil over medium heat okay so I don't know what medium heat means I'm just gonna assume that's in the medium well I'm just Shawn here waiting let's talk about our feelings I think that's really important to do sometimes so basically I am making mac and cheese today because I feel like even though I don't even really like mac and cheese that much like I like it but it's definitely not my favorite food I would honestly prefer any other type of pasta but I felt like it would be a fun challenge I also feel like when you go over to your friend's house and their mom made dinner 9 out of 10 times they made mac and cheese and that's too much I don't know oh wait [ __ ] I didn't measure it and I was supposed to I don't care I can eyeball it hey you should add more I don't really care okay I get to pee so bad should I just go and stop torturing myself no I should because that's not how I work oh my god cut it the wrong [ __ ] way look this is the thought I'm in it okay so you can't see the pan but I can see it and that's all that matters two heaping tablespoons of flour I know look what I did look I got it all over the [ __ ] look at that I [ __ ] up big-time now I am you can't see it you wouldn't know what I'm doing right now what do you think I'm doing well you don't know because you can't see it but I'm actually mixing the flour and the oil together and it's making a slight sizzling sound you probably can't hear it because I don't own a microphone I just tell my videos in the lowest quality possible because I'm a piece of trash but that's okay because that's what you signed up for it's not something burning oh my god I know what it is please departments video my camera just shut off and said that it had a detective error like I don't know what that means I don't even know how long it's been not filming and I was like honestly worried about it oh why does this happen to me I'm offended oh my god it's just burning I don't know no it's not thick at all they turn off the stove oh my god I think I turn this one off I did well how did that happen oh my god I'm sure already and then to pee so bad [ __ ] it I'm go feet out gonna go pee real quick so someone's calling me I don't even have time to rebut in my pants I have been a [ __ ] business to attend to here okay but really enough what's that matter feelings I'm trying to think what do I want to talk about I really don't care to talk about anything right now because I'm just really distracted do it I know we can talk about what nice break my bell oh my god I did write on it we did I ring my bell oh my god it kind of did break a little bit [ __ ] you know what it's fine it looks fine like this no but now my pants are falling down too many sucks oh I think it actually does it's tough because this is actually getting kind of fit but not thick enough sis look it's kind of liquidity should I add more flour to make it a little thicker why not [ __ ] it we don't have anything to lose and that's fine oh this is getting thicker do you know what I'm a [ __ ] genius I knew that the amount of Paula Deen I used to watch when I was little would pay off because I did used to watch Paula Deen I actually loved The Cooking Channel in general when I was younger and like Food Network all that [ __ ] my girl like chopped if that was my shape oh this is nice and thick now [ __ ] yes I knew it like I remember watching the [ __ ] cooking shows back in the day they'd be like your sauce is a little bit you know struggling just add a little bit more flour and that is what I did and now I feel perfect Jim this has three minutes left let's give it a little mix sorry being the wife he is really hard if you can't take the heat maybe you should there's no way to turn that into a joke that isn't offensive so I'm just not gonna do it oh my god this is really chunky this is a little bit too chunky I don't think that's the correct consistency you know what's something had to go wrong so oh my god the pastas done holy [ __ ] I found that too [ __ ] fast oh I'm not ready straining my strainer as [ __ ] [ __ ] in it okay aunt oh it's time to finish our sauce wow this is actually really good I'm actually really like concerned about kinda how good this is going because I thought I was going bad but then I'm starting to question how shitty of a person I am this is a questionable ingredient this is called nutritional yeast and I've eaten it before but it's never been a main component in my meals and I'm kind of worried about how it's gonna make this face she's been added it's spilling everywhere I'm so sorry mom I know you cleaned earlier but like I'm just messy when I literally go to a restaurant the area around me has like spilled food you know this is not a nice color actually the area around me [ __ ] has literal food all over it like it's a mess I know maybe I'm Harrison trained me properly that's gonna be interesting throughout my life seeing how I develop as a human being but still make messes that's gonna be embarrassing like when I'm [ __ ] at my wedding and we're all eating dinner and then like there's [ __ ] food all around me and I'm also like 25 actually want to get married when I'm older than 25 well you want I don't know I don't know the age of getting married I don't really care nobody wants to marry me anyway stuff this is the biggest container of garlic murder ever seen but that was the only option at the store so what can I say so they didn't have to boil a powder at my store that I went to because Australia when she was actually kind of shitty I just have to hope that Jesus has my back right now because I really want this today's food because I'm Wow almost done with the [ __ ] mac and cheese I'm so excited oh the colors getting better no it's not looks like poop now okay see you this smells back that kind of tastes cheesy I'm actually really scared it's a little bit gross but it's kind of not that bad so I'm a little bit worried about why that tastes kind of good let's get right to it ladies it smells weird as [ __ ] like it has oil that was a lot of salt [ __ ] think about how much sodium is in kraft mac and cheese probably like enough to [ __ ] feed an entire country let's try it now [Music] oh my god wait kind of good wait what what the [ __ ] oh man assault its salad time because you like getting your greens is so important sorry my voice really also make me one of the iconic so you want to die to the stuff gonna stop but the perfect to make the dressing so let's do it though I'm really excited because I'm making a Greek salad today and Greek salads are my favorite type of salad do you care no but I just told you so joke's on you lots of good veggies in there there's no bacon [ __ ] or ranch in it so I mean overall that's how you know you're doing something kind of right I actually personally hate ranch let's talk about that I'm so sorry too much I can't handle having knives okay do like I'm sick of this I literally just want to go lay down and close make something this is a lot of popular I'm a drastic do Scoville mustard in my not but I actually kind of like mustard so kind of gross over bunnies right when I was younger mustard [ __ ] straight out of the literal container like I literally squirt mustard into my mouth like I know I was a sociopath you don't mean to tell me oh no what do we do don't laugh but that was my favorite snack like I was literally eat it like I'd do that nonsense I remember one day I was really bored and I was watching Fred on YouTube a shocker there and I was eating mustard out of the [ __ ] container like every kid does you know I was so into the video that actually the entire thing of mustard myself in one sitting and it was a new container I think I died from sodium overdose that day and I've been dead inside ever since I forget they're like spices actually make a difference if you don't put spices into [ __ ] it doesn't have any flavor Wow big [ __ ] revelation there but still comment down below your favorite type of salad you also comment down below if you like to cook come on out here sorry every time I burp it tastes like mac and cheese and I can tell that's a good thing or a bad thing now we're gonna mix this let's not be [ __ ] stupid say no more mmm can you can see it out there this mini whisk is not gonna get done but honestly I'm just gonna use it anyway to be on grant know I'm sick of it that looks kind of good I can't see it so you wouldn't know but let's move my phone out of the work station that's not healthy for the line thought you were so it's just the right knife to use I own it I literally got tomatoes for this because that's what's in the recipe even though I honestly be completely honest between you and me don't even really like tomatoes so kind of like cutting lettuce it's kind of like really sad it's finally losing that sound what do you start getting too close to the base of the romaine lettuce it gets bitter stuff and if you know that you're real homey swipe up wake up wow that looks so good it's actually just going kind of well with this video like I had really low expectations and honestly for a good reason because I'm actually super untalented but like right over this oh I'm gonna put in like one tomato because I really don't like them that's enough garbanzo beans imagine if I actually called it that seriously would you want subscribe I would [ __ ] oh there we go do you want to put a little grease into it and then cooking on a daily basis from now on just because I don't have any promises what regardless it looks really great is going well ok let's eat [Music] Wow time to eat this whole process took me way too [ __ ] long but it was kind of fun I mean the mess I made was still annoying because the post makes you just order it and then you eat it but then you throw away your trash and then you're done and you didn't make any mess nothing happened but then instead you are being irresponsible with your health so I mean you'll be losing both ways this is definitely not back like earlier it's been overreacting wait what oh my god what the [ __ ] oh wow it's good it's not the best thing I've ever eaten but it's better than what I expected what am I gonna get absolutely not does it work for now sure oh hey Wow very fresh don't even want to eat next we know I don't even like tomatoes I know I put it in this way I would like this again oh you don't want to watch me let me just tell you this making your own meals is healthier more satisfying and overall that our experience that's a complete [ __ ] line it's not really a better experience but it's the right decision making meals for yourself is what you should even though it's not the easy thing sometimes in life the easy things are the wrong things and that's what I'm handed a video with that lesson to keep in mind I hope you enjoyed I hope you had fun maybe it'll inspire you to make your own home cooked meal that's then I'm shooting the video and I'll see you later [Music] [Music] you

-emma chamberlain",2018-09-16T18:56:30Z,441737,6774702,21147,"HI!!!!!!! Oh God Ugh Hi, how are you guys hope you're doing great I'm fucking tired but have no fear, because I have a remedy *chuckle* So you know me and you we haven't bonded recently I mean, we have but not enough we need more of each other i wanna catch you up on my life and so today we are doing the laziest form of youtube content a Q&A!!!!! ew yAs i thought it would be kinda fun if we took it back to the good old days and we just chill with some philzzz you know and had a little talking moment and spill some tea and fuckin tell you whats up Before we start the Q&A I thought I'd just fill you in on my life soooo I'm really cold right now because I have my AC turned on to 60 degrees which is not good It's too cold, but I don't care because Iike it like that and my toes are numb and I can barely feel my hands and this coffee is iced and I am kinda dying and I kinda want to die but like I don't know why but this is just the way that I live my life so moving on *slurpppppppppp* haven't cooked myself a home cooked meal in a long time I've just been post-mating food for every single meal and I'm worried about it is my health declining? probably. At an alarming rate? Also probably. So yeah I'll keep you updated on that its been fun, it's been really fun.. I get avocado toast I get ThAi fOoD I get burritos, i get sushi I get coffee I mean like you name it, I'm getting it My family is concerned I don't really care, in other news summer is over I'm getting pale I was pale even during the summer which is disturbing but now that summers kind of over im rEaLLy getting pale Do I fake tan my shit or do I not? and I just let the pale come in see, the thing is i think I'm gonna fake tan speaking of fall let's light a candle, cuz i have one right here and its fucking amazing its pumpkin nutmeg flavor oh my god its so fucking boner-ific never using that word again, sorry its very yummy and I'm going to light it right now because i dont care if you dont want me to and- cuz im doing it funny story went to my friends house last night and i forgot to blow that out when i left my house and i realized that a few minutes after i left and i was panicking i come home today expecting my entire apartment to be fucking burned down to the ground and turns out i think i did blow it out yeah i think thats it now lets get into the Q&A because i dont have anything else to talk about Have you lost your v-card? i think that you meant c-card like you know a little abbrevation for credit card and no, ive actually never lost my credit card before and i dont plan on it because that would be like, really stressful like what if somebody picked it up off the ground and started buying like appliances like what if somebody like fucking found it and bought themselves a new fridge in turn i then bought them a new fridge because its my credit card like that would be really upsetting so How many mental breakdowns do u have per day? i had a solid week there where i was having a minimum of 4 but now that things have kind of settled down id say a minimum of 3 my mental breakdowns really kind of vary sometimes we have tantrums on the ground sometimes we just cry a little bit sometimes we cry for about 2 minutes and then just take selfies of me crying for like another 5 minutes until all the tears dry and then theres no more selfie material would u ever get a tattoo? funny you say that because i actually do kind of want a tattoo i really wanted a lip tat like right here or maybe like a tat on my hands oh, speak of hands, look my fucking nail broke off so thats classy and cute, love that let me know some tattoo suggestions down below if you know what i should get i was gonna get like 'fuck' on my lip (pls no) cuz thats just kind of on brand maybe a drawing of a penis (oh god) i was just kind of teetering something funny, something quirky something i wont regret i think if i get a penis on my lip i wont regret it so let me know what you think favorite dog breed dog breeds are one of those things where a dog is a dog, you know what i mean the motherfucker comes up to me and like licks my toes or something and i love it <3 i dont care about the breed but i do love maltipoos and i really fucking want one so if anybody wants to buy me one and send it to my house, id love that first kiss aha smooch smooch wow *sluuurp* i dont believe in kissing i think its a sin so i dont do that aand *if u want the actual story go to olivia jade's channel :)* if this video gets 9 million likes i'll tell my first kiss story so guys go like it up even though ive never kissed anyone cause im a virgin well if you're like me and you're not a FUCKING idiot you just take a ruler preferable one of the really, like, kinda bendy ones from like fucking home depot no thats not the right place one of the bendy ones from like the dollar section of Target aand you just bend it as such *a genius in the making* you bend it around the circle u know and then you just measure it fuck a formula even though i think its wait c = *work overload* pi r squared? wait is that right? if thats fucking right i'm literally gonna give my self a fucking kiss FUCK i fucked it up (whats new) circumference is 2 pi r squared OkAy SoRrY like now i kinda already did in the beginning and i'm doing pretty good you know i had a few rough months behind me but we're kinda coming out of it and we're kinda fucking slaying everything happens for a reason thats my fucking motto for realz tho like if you really think about it and you really think about it u know? whatever just happened just now thats really fucking shitty it probably has a reason for it it'll probably end up teaching u something down the line that's very valuable and that's kinda the tea i was going to get a dog right? and i really wanted one but the thing is is that I AM AN IDIOT and so thats something to be considered because i dont want to get a dog and then the dog u kno uhhh suffer because im an idiot I think it's really considerate of me and really nice and honestly so generous and sweet of me to not get a dog because it just proves that i know im an idiot to give you some context here: I didn't wash my sheets for four months   um...yeah I mean- you know- we're having fun aUuUUuGUGHh so....yeah I mean it's good I get to go fuckin...do nothing you know what? no. now the sunglass emoji means a LOT to me basically- let me explain sunglass emoji can mean anything you want it to mean like let's say u want to say: ""what's up bitch"" let's say u want to say: ""damn u look good today"" let's say u want to say: ""I just got an A on my test, and you're a fucking idiot"" like- it's so versatile and that's why I love it because it's that perfect it was MADE for us you know what? no. but I can do this because I was a cheerleader and I am still flexible so this is ur treat of the day *booing* do u know what? let's get crazy wOoOOoOOoOW *booing* so absolutely fucking not no umMMMmmM nO even though sometimes I like always get sad because i think ""wow it could be cool to go to a football game"" and then I really think about it and I'm like MmMMm football games are cold, there is usually some sort of drama like ""oH Jessica JuSt kissed MaTtHeW"" ""AnD I LiKE MAttHeW"" and it always gets weird when you have to decide who you sit with at the football game like ""oh am I gonna sit with Jessica today? or am I gonna sit with the BOyS no I don't miss it thank you for asking I woke up, went to brunch: had a coffee got home: had a coffee now it's 5:30 pm and I have another coffee I love candles I love boys I love socks that are, like, really fuzzy and shit I love hoodies I love...my BED I love photos taking pictures...no I don't that's actually really not true, I fucking hate taking photos of myself I love when I just get out of the shower and I feel all clean and like my legs are shaved and i'm like ""damn. i'm a woman for once"" I love when I'm not on my period THAT'S NICE I like blankets I love coffee I love YOU <3 I love my family and my friends I love candles I love seasons like I love all the different seasons I love the fact that there's a lot of them you know, there's like all four of them you never know which one it's gonna be that month I love eating STUFFING I fuck with that I love that I love...not eating turkey I love not playing football because I don't like playing sports I love black friday oh fuck BLACK! FUCKING! FRIDAY! it's just the experience you always get something good like last year I got my coffee machine and I've been using that motherfucker ever since I love that shit its just fun. it's a good time to bond with the buds you know what I mean? go out to black Friday with the buds maybe go with your mom, maybe go with your aunt, maybe go with your fucking granny I don't care it's always an adventure cuz it's like late at night and I have this weird kink for doing things at night roblox is not fucking fun at all I literally played roblox one time and was like this is literally the worst game of all time and then I fucking decided I would never play it again also I have a really big zit on my forehead I don't know where it came from I don't know what I did to deserve it probably the fact that I postmate every meal doesn't help 0_0 no??? um...that is funny and that would be funny if i did that you know what I mean, cuz i'd go onto the toilet sit down and i'd film it and i'd blur out my vagina and my asshole people would probably laugh but that's a lot of effort cuz like imagine me taking my camera and my light all the way into the bathroom setting that up and then pulling down my pants I just don't think I could promise anything too big today well, see, I don't really like either of them but based on what I tried in my last video ~go check it out if you want~ I like chicken better what would you have named me if I was a boy? dad: ummmm I can't remember HOW DO U NOT REMEMBER okay let me guess: chandler help me out here, I need content dad: oliver? oliver? that's what I named my cat, so that's weird should I call my mom? dad: I remember I said jeffro, as a joke jeffro? oh...let's just be glad I didn't come out with a penis then dad: what was ur moms....jango jango?? dad: jack, jonah jango, ja- what is it with her and j names oh my god imagine me being a boy, like having a weiner and being named jonah dad: and isaiah issac??? (no ISAIAH omg) those are terrible names MOM I felt like the hype was SOOO big and then all of a sudden ~POOF~ and no one cares anymore I think it's time to play toontown again so everybody let's go on toontown tomorrow at 2 pm just kidding I'm TwElVe YeArS oLd you know, i'm fucking pissed about it because that is the ugliest photo of me that has ever existed in this world and it's pretty embarrassing because all of my friends have seen it and you guys have now all seen it and I will never live it down it's something that was just a force of nature to be completely honest I don't even think I look like that and maybe I do and I'm worried okay IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO BE- ow fuck AHH okay i'm done I don't want to do that anymore it's not even funny so it's just pointless at this point somebody who....likes me back my twitter profile picture is very special and there is a very distinct story behind it so I will proceed to tell you that now when I was in like, third grade maybe even second or first I woke up and I had pinkeye in both eyes and my eyes were fucking puffy as shit I decided I would send a photo to my mom I took my little flip phone and I sent a little mirror pic to my mom and that is the photo that exists now and she thought it was so funny that my eyes were swollen u fucking bitch mom and she posted it on her facebook, so all of her fucking friends saw it and THEN, to make matter worse she just laughed about it and didn't respond to my text fast forward to now I was on my mom's facebook looking through all of her photos and I found THAT i'm kind of embarrassed of my favorite type of soup cuz I feel like it's a really unpopular opinion and I don't want to be ripped a new one right now and I know I probably will and i'm worried about it my favorite type of soup is sweet pea and u know what? okay I get it It looks like boogers but its really fucking good so I don't want to hear it u know I haven't killed anyone, so this is a stupid question like, chill do I seem like that to you? like I'm kind of offended u even asked I am not pregnant!!!!!!!!!!! although because of all the postmates I've been ordering it kind of looks like it but I am in fact not pregnant u fucking bitch u should know better, that u don't ask a woman if she is pregnant if u don't know for sure because there is a decent chance that they're just fat well it could be this this is not good but it could also be this which is also not good but then it could also be this which is BAD but it could also be this which is REALLY bad but it could also be this which is kinda good I don't even think this one is bad I mean, this is just one of the better photos that exists of me uhhh this is hard but you could get creative and say something like ""teachers are like vacuums, they suck"" or you could say something a little more risque kind of like a big bang to end off the school year with and you can say *inaudible* why'd I just say it like that? I STRONGLY believe in swords I think that you need to have one under your pillow under your bed in your night stand behind your fridge on top of ur fridge on ur dining room table hanging up above ur bed there´s no way to survive ANY misfortune without a sword why do i keep saying it like that? like swwword the w is silent idk what i dont get about that SWORD 100% picking a wedgie becuz theres something so much more violent about picking ur nose picking a wedgie is pretty sane u are not even touching ur actual ass ur just kinda doin it thru ur pants u know picking ur nose u r fucking shoving ur finger into an orphus well we r going to stop right the question right there and say yes I sucked my thumb for NINE YEARS u r supposed to stop sucking ur thumb when u r idk TWO AND A HALF but i just kept going for it till i was nine well the only thing is that James is GAY YES u know sometimes we need a break sometimes we want to put out content that is not creative or beneficial or entertaining or useful at all thats what being a youtuber is all about its sometimes about disappointing Ive actually never been on a date thats not how the 21st century works we dont go on dates we snapchat boys and then get left on read imagine wiping ur ass standing up and thinking that thats okay i,, am not an idiot and im also not,,,, an idiot im also not a sociopath sO rUdE so disrespectful such an inconvenience so upset about it but it also allows me to one day have lil baby chambies and thats cute so im down one time i accidentally ordered an uber to the wrong place and so that like the uber didnt show up to like where i was u know umm and nothing really bad happened it was just really upsetting oh my god actually funny that we r saying this because lately ive been listening to some emo music in the car cuz ive kinda been getting into my feels recently when I listen to .... or sizza i start to get so into the music that i CLOSE MY EYES while im driving or amy whinehouse and im fucking driving and im like WHY DONT U COME ON- and then i fucking open my eyes and im about to hit a car that has happened to me multiple times kinda fun kinda worth it and i guess thats the last question of the Q&A today im done im fucking done im tired kind of an emotional wreck but we had a fun time catching up with me and we had a lil coffee date <3 I love u guys <3 PEACE OUT BITCH BYEEEE sister subscribe"

Yes I've been vegetarian my whole life but I have tried a few meats you know cause like sometimes bacon. YoU kNoW wHaT I'm SaYiNg so ive had bacon and then I've also had pepperoni  on pizza and thats kinda wild you know like it's rare definitely one of those things where like its the first day of school and like the teacher's like ""okay everybody say a fun fact"" and I'm like ""I've never had meat before"" and its like really cool and the whole class is like ""oH mY gOd yoU'rE kidDing"" and then I get attention for like 20 minutes and then nobody talks to me for the rest of the year like it's still cool though *American horror story theme song* let's do it bring it oh I also have my friends here who are going to help me like they picked out meat for me because obviously like naturally I'm not going to like know what to pick out.

-emma chamberlain",2018-07-29T03:27:48Z,407049,8936624,28082,"( desparate sigh) Hi its 2 A.M what the fuck am I doing? *nervous chuckle* okay I am ready for bed. I got all my shit goin on I got my like, pimple cream on I got... you know what I mean? I'm ready for bed. but plot twist - im not going to bed *dramatic drum thing* I... pull all nighters like.. A LOT probably too much, like an unhealthy amount I'd say at least once a week if not like, TWICE not like more than twice because like if I do more than two in the week, like I LOSE IT like I'm talking about like maniac behavior I'm talking about call the social security number... that didn't make any sense this is so ironic like I'm literally pulling one right now, it's 5 am, FIVE AM (puts down phone) *tHuNK* (sighs) I need help but I can't go to bed tonight and let me tell you why well... I spent the past four hours watching a crime documentary on Netflix it's actually called ""Evil Genius"" - this is not partnered with them although I wish it was netflix - eEughhH it's like a four-part documentary with four episodes and it is CREEPY AS FUCK and I'm SPOOKED as FUCK but here's the problem, right? normally when I watch scary shit at night I usually follow it up with something fun and light-hearted to kind of like, take my mind off things and make me a litte bit like less anxious or whatever tonight, that wasn't an option MY WIFI JUST DIED died I don't know what's going on, I'm very concerned and worried and my ability to watch a funny and heartwarming video before bed was TAKEN AWAY FROM ME AND RIPPED OUT OF MY HANDS and now I'm all freaked out I tried to like lay in bed but my heart was like BEATING like I literally can't go to bed like I -d-  I CAN'T *SPOOKED* I had the idea to pull an all-nighter and when I usually pull all-nighters it's to edit because I have to get a video done (cheery music) this time its different because I don't have anything I need to get done tonight well, I do but I'm just not gonna do it. I was like, why not turn this moment of anxiety into CONTENT *cheering* first thing that I think we need to do is - we need to make a coffee sis don't be silly here, now I'm also not taking off my pimple cream, I don't care what anybody says, like these zits need to go away great... for our first all-nighter activity, we're just gonna get hyped up on coffee because that's always the best way to start a video and the only way in my career, thus far that I've started a video I'm really excited because i bought these cool vanilla coffee pods for my espresso and they just taste absolutely phenom(enal) soOoo been really digging that lately also got these mini little... espresso... jars... that I can use. ALSO PHENOM(enal) does anybody really care about the stuff I'm talking about right now? I mean I hope not because that would be kind of sad, like imagine if you cared about my coffee pods that's like depressing but I mean if you do care...  bless your soul baby also, something really funny happened to me the other day and I thought I would share I decided that I would be a conscientious health queen for not only my self but also for the Earth and thought that I would start buying reusable straws because... so I decided that I would order some reusable straws off amazon and care for my planet. I don't know I wasn't really thinking I just literally added the first ones I saw to my cart and then called it a day they show up to my house the other day. okay and look how fucking long they are WHAT? like? (pretends to sip from straw) like what the fuck is this? and I ordered like 40 of them like why would I I don't know wha- I don't know why I couldn't tell you maybe I'll use it today... that'd be kind of funny would you laugh if I used it? (crash) (crash) this video you would think like oh all-nighter like wow this is gonna be a lit vlog well you're wrong. because there's literally nothing to do at night I don't know what to do maybe we could fold some laundry (crowd booing) maybe we'll go to the store might go to the store and buy Cheez-Its I dont know lately I've been really into Cheez-Its *bubbly slurping* this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen i literally can't believe myself but im kinda into it *more bubbly slurping sounds* wait is this lowkey like... really bomb as fuck like this whole thing going on here like the coffee tastes great the straw is actually a great distance from my head i can do it without hands im kind of fucking with this WHY AM I NOT MAD AT THIS SITUATION THIS IS SO AGAINST ALL SOCIAL QUEUES I thought i'd do a little laundry folding life update because honestly you guys have a lot that you need to be updated on also the camera's crooked is that better? nope but, whatever *sighs* A lot has happened i moved to LA i live here now do i like it? yes am i having an identity crisis? yes let's not lie about it i had my whole routine down at home you know, i have my friends, i had my life i had everything like figured out and then i moved here and all of that is changed my entire youtube life career all started and existed-- when i was at home and so know im trying to like adjust here, and like figure out a new routine because i dont have a routine down right now none of this probably makes any sense and im probably going to cut all of this out, but like its alot anyways so now that im admitted to the internet that im having an identify crisis let's talk about some fun things oh, one fun thing that everybody is just DYING to know about is why i moved here, cause i remember i said a little while back, that there was this whole big scary reason that i moved here that i moved here, and there IS but i know realize , and I talked to my parents about it and they agree. it's not the best idea safety wise to talk about it , yet because my mom still lives in the apartment that i used to live in and i go home and still visit there sometimes so talking about this situation while i still return to that same home, sometimes its not a good idea yeah like I don't wanna die .... actually i kinda do I can't tell the story yet, but once my mom moves, which i dont know when she's gonna move might be in a year, might be in six months might be in five years but you have my word, that i will tell you the story, its a little sketch and it will be really good clickbait i kinda got you guys excited about that for nothing, then my parents will be like ""Emma, you can't tell the story yet cause it's not safe."" and then I was like *high pitched ""Oooh""* I think those were the two big elephants in the room Lets try to think about things that aren't disappointing Uhhh- Wow, can't really think of any hmm That's... upsetting Well, I mean, some good news would be that my apartment's coming along QuitE nicely Feeling REALLY good about that You know what? We're having fun with the process I'm getting really JAcked from having to move things everyday Furniture and big boxes so that's really good for me and also me looking like a boy more than before Which is upsetting because we are still single and we are still looking for love more desperately than EVER EVERRRR!!! what else is going on? wow, really running out of stuff ummm.. *tsk* really starting to get desperate here In other news,  I haven't shaved my legs in a month I look like a Chinchilla and  it's not good and, I'm not okay with it I can feel my leg hairs static-ing to my to sweat pants right now and I'm NOT okay with it, I'm not and I don't want it to be that way and I never  wanted it to EVER be that way - I - this isn't what I wanted I'm not gonna hate on myself because I.. do my best and I.. am just living in the moment and doing me *booing and fart sound effects* ok I'm done folding my laundry I have nothing else to do with that ..so now we have to figure out another activity to do so that you guys don't get bored umm.. *fast paced action music* comment down below if you guys think this video is super f*cking boring I think we're gonna go to the grocery store and buy cheese-its do I need to do that? NO did I have pizza today? yeah, I did and I ate like four slices of it and I also had breadsticks and garlic bread and I'm feeling very thick But I really want Cheese-ITs you have to follow your gut and what is my gut saying? Its saying ""Cheese-ITs. NOW."" *slurping sound effect*
I love that for me *slurping sound effect*
mmm... That is hot...mmm This cream I probably should wash it off
Cause it kinda looks like cocaine People in LA are very judgemental When you are going in publlic, even at night, late at night You never know who you are going to see THATs worrysome I don't want to be judged.. for who I am
BUT in LA, you are judged for who you are whereas at home I can go around looking like a piece of ass lets rephrase I can walk around looking like ass no one really cares, but here, you get stared at It's like...
(sigh) I find myself trying to look good when I'm here because everyone else looks good Its like weird for me because I'm very used to not giving a fUcK But here I'm kind of like more like ""oh shit maybe I will put on a little more concealer today on my under-eye bags"" (voiceover) you know what that might not be a bad idea There's nothing wrong with putting a little effort in"

I'm actually not a mess I'm doing good, I'm  doing very nice and well,  so here's what's up. Tomorrow's July 7th. What's July 7th? My dad's birthday Yeah ew my neck looks so long right now Anyway, I live in LA now as you know, my dad lives in Northern California, San Francisco... no one cares So originally I wasn't gonna fly home to see my dad for his birthday because my dad's literally coming to visit me in LA On July 9th, so I was like two days after his birthday I was like we can just celebrate then but then I gotta text my grandma and she's like, you know You should fly home and surprise your dad and I was like, oh my god tea like that's kind of a good idea kind of want to do that. So last night. Fuck leave me alone fuck. So last night I booked flights home San Francisco to visit my dad for his birthday he doesn't know I'm coming, tonight and I'm going and I'm going to stay at my mom's house and then tomorrow I'm gonna Surprise him. Be like sup bitch happy bday. And that's his gift. Actually. That's not his gift I ordered him a laptop for his birthday because my dad has been wanting a laptop for a really long time He and it's edits, he's a youtuber by the way go subscribe link in the bio for him. My dad's been editing on his iPad for like six months now or more and he's Frustrated with it because I mean, I can't even imagine editing on an iPad that would be like impossible and you know I was like bitch It's not for you to step it up, but he didn't want to make the investment because the iPad was working for him He's like, you know what? I'm not gonna buy a laptop. It's really expensive I literally don't even know the definition of investment apparently because I don't even think that buying a laptop is investing I think it's just spending money and going broke But I know that that's what that bitch wants. So I ordered it. I'm really excited gonna give that to him tomorrow So right now it's like 7:45. I have to leave for the airport in about 15 minutes Um I should  probably call my uber, gonna do that. Yeah. I'm excited to be home This is first time I'm going home since I moved to LA. So that's fucking lit I'm so tired right now because did I had to carry literally a 400 pound package. Okay, it was probably like 30 pounds but like it felt like 400 pounds. I just realized that literally in every single video I complain about the fact that I have to carry boxes to my apartment because it's an everyday occurrence, and it's Breaking my bones and I'm dying. But yeah, I'm gonna stop because like you guys get it, like I have to carry packages Call your jets mommy, you know I'm not gonna say that ever again. I do carry like this big-ass package from my apartment lobby into my apartment and I swear to God It was probably one of the worst things I've ever had to do in my life and to make matters worse He's 110 degrees in LA right now Bitch, I'm dying. It is hot as fuck. I've literally been inside all day because I can't fuckin handle that So I'm like tired. I'm drained. I'm a mess. That's the tea. I've been talking for way too long Every youtuber always has that but the whole point of YouTube is to talk. So I don't really know, you know what I'm talking about But yeah, they get to see my dad and get to go home Yay It's the next day you don't care I'm outside of my dad's like art gallery reception thing that's going on right now gonna go in and surprise him. It's his bday I haven't even texted him yet, which is fucked up. Like you probably think that like forgot or something Well, I didn't okay. So I'm that my mom filmed that which is so awkward. I feel like I'm like a prank channel Hate that, haven't brushed my hair in five days. It's my Grandma. We have to be quiet No way what is up girl? Happy bday, wow what a surprise, I know. Oh my god we're vlogging Most of the time when kids surprise their parents in YouTube videos There's like tears and emotional trauma and just a lot of emotion. But I mean this was pretty chill I guess you didn't argue that I haven't seen my dad like what a month, so it wasn't really anything too crazy No tears nothing to clickbait with. Yes. I'm a little bit mad. Dad. Please do better next time expecting a few tears Maybe even I don't know something crazy like fall on the floor and start rolling around or something like let's spice this up next time content, you know anything like you can't just like Not you know like cry at least you know, I like tear up that was it pretty anti-climatic. Not any high emotions Okay, so I don't my dad to come into the car because I was gonna give him something real quick So we're gonna do that right now. Fuck. I'm all nervous. So we're on camera. Hey, what's up everybody? Are you uncomfortable? No, of course not. Why? I'm like on camera all the time I have 100 videos We're both youtubers, yeah I didn't even have the decency, no I didn't even have the decency to wrap it So, here you go. Oh my god this is too much Well I mean it's in a whole foods bag, so it's not gonna be anything good Look how much space is above my head. Okay. Why don't you stop and open this? Kids my content is just about to get a whole lot better. Fuck Yeah, go subscribe cause I just bought him this laptop Picture me like sitting in a cafe just Like I edit all my videos on an iPad Mini that, oh i already told them that It's like I got you the SD card adapter and also USB adapter Oh my god, thank you kid. Wow that is so sweet Happy twentieth bday That's Awesome, no, I'm excited. I hope you use it. That'd be super good for you I could boot this thing up and use it tonight. Fuck Yeah, you are. Okay. Well, he just turned 20 so go subscribe. That's his gift. Yeah, peace guys, peace This is a super short video like I normally make pretty long ass videos on my channel, but this video was really short But I mean, I thought I'd upload it. Anyways, you know, just throw it up for funsies. See what I could do.  But Yeah Hope you guys enjoyed regardless even though it was short as fuck I'll be back later this week with another regular length video, but I just thought I'd throw it up for fun So hopefully enjoyed seeing me do a good deed, um pretty rare. No. I'm just kidding But well, hope you guys enjoyed it guys. Have a good day do something nice for your family Um, or don't I mean it's kind of up to you. It's a free country So maybe when I start making a little bit more money, I'll buy my dad a car or something So I'll be the next episode dad. If you're watching this. Don't get your hopes up, though. Alright, bye Love ya  "

i think thats about right okay I am pale as fuck and so.. oh my god! okay well thats nudes i'm not gonna do that i gotta really bad sun burn yeah so… thats been something after that i came back to my apartment and i moved like probably ... i dont know…. ten pieces of furniture from my apartment lobby to my apartment almost died and cracked mentally sorry hannah i promise i'll let you talk in a second NO i'm enjoying this like … keep going she is like.. no i'm enjoying this e e e emma… please don please don't please do not... please do not punish me than i edited from... basically night time untill the morning time and… i didn't go to bed i pulled all night we know how we do and then i get a lil knock on my door and who is here ME well it's miss hannah meloche hey guys its me WOOH i had a very rough day as you might imagine but when… this little little... nub- nubbin i had no clue thats what that meant showed up on my door step i knew that it was gonna be good so basically moral of the story is... bae is visiting me but guess what we're not a complete squad without our last member ellie is coming to LA... to visit me with also hannah who's also visiting me in LA band is getting back together we're freaking pumped i had a very rough time leading up to right now so, i'm just glad to be here oh, to make matters worse my camera broke. so here's my camera it used to go… like this. and then this screen would flip up but now they aren't connected anymore um... so that's good and to make matters worse i ordered one about three days ago it was suppose to show up on Sunday today is Tuesday i go to my apartment mail room and turns out they lost the package with my camera in it so today... me and hannah went and we bought a new camera for me this is my new camera i like it thank you for listening none of that probably made any sense do you think that even make sense do you think it did ?

I mean as great as it could be Caesar salads are so good This one just happened to be 28 dollars Was it worth it? Of course not! But it was a great experience and I'm really glad I went Thank you so much to God for creating this reastaurant I just got a text and you heard it, I'm sorry You always what? I always wondered what it smells like What my car? Yeah! I love you! byeee I love you guys Oh my God Jesus fuck First shopping point of the day Tj maxx Feeling very big Why is te lighting so bad? we are traumatised we just found out that there is not a home section of this Tj maxx just the clothing section so there is a TJ Maxx that has a home section like a half mile away from us but do you know what? we are traumatized. We came all the way here expecting I'm not okay by the way, do I look okay to you? I'm on my way to Home Goods feeling really good. So I'm on my way to the home.. So we're.. (booing) So we're on our way to TJ Maxx/Home Goods.There's a little home section. We were feeling really great feeling really confident and I look at my emails to see that me entire urban outfitters order was canceled If you're wondering why I'm so.. I don't know.. triggered about the fact that my entire Urban outfitters order was canceled is because I ordered almost all if not literally all of my furniture off of urban outfitters oRbAn and it was canceled so that meant that like none of my furniture was on its way y'know what I'm saying? And that was upsetting to me, as one might imagine And to make matters worse, this ended up happening four more times And I didn't' know that when I was filming this, I had no clue Emma from the future is here to tell you that that did not happen once, twice... That happened four times. Urban Outfitters, I love you. Sponsor me. Um, I did have a mental breakdown about that at one point As one might imagine, I mean I have a - I have a mental breakdown about everything but like this really got to me, so I had literally my couch, multiple chairs, rugs, fucking everything in this order and it's just cancelled I'm destroyed I'm upset Thank you and goodnight But at least we're at Home Goods Fuckin' who cares about Home Goods when your entire Urban Outfitters thing gets cancelled Mom: Yeah but they could - they could have a couple cool chairs! Also, I made an order on Dote and accidentally used my old address I sent everything to my old address So like, that's convenient! Use code EMMA for $5 off your first order of Dote not spons Yay. Finally, we're in the right place, this is actually home decor, Feeling really confident now, *to Mom* How are you feeling? Mom: I'm feeling confident *cheesy music* Okay, so I think we're not gonna be getting art from here *cheering* good morning everybody today we're going to IKEA! we were gonna go to ikea yesterday but- mom: you said hi-kea :/ okay, fu- IIIKEA.

James: That's too small. Okay. You can't get a Gucci belt and have a small Gucci belt. The whole point is that you spent too much money on it. You need those fat jeans bro. Like imagine getting that. You can't because like... you know? *booing sound effect*   Grayson: You can Well, you shouldn't though. *music* Feeling like a big fat bitch right now. Yeah, you feel like a douche bag everyday carrying this around. But you have to, you're in L.A. Alright, James went shopping for himself So know it's up to us. Grayson: wear this Emma: That is so ugly... p eople in Idaho wear that Grayson: Where is Idaho? Okay number one, there is nothing wrong with Idaho guys. Sorry to bash all you Idahoans *laughing* I don't think that's right. And number two Grayson, how do you not know where Idaho is? Like are you alright dude? Grayson: Well that was pointless because we did't get anything. Grayson: Actually, we did. That's all we need. ""laughing* Secure the bag. James: best sister shopphing Grayson: We don't even need rent. I cannot afford my rent this month. And am I worried about it? Of course I'm worried about it. Everyone: You're not worried about it. Emma: I mean I live here. I can sell my fridge - I don't even need it. James: Sell? Emma: I Postmate all my food now that I live here. So I don't need that.. James: That is correct. I don't need a fridge. I also don't need a dishwasher. Like who uses that? I can wash them myself. Ethan: no you don't hand-wash. James: You hire a servant. Or I could use paper plates. *Everyone talks about paper plates* Ethan: You need a third assistant. Ethan: You assistants assistant. So are you guys like my assistants then? Yeah you are. Grayson: Is any of this funny? *music* Guys: Ohhhhh! Thicc! Dang! She's here. You did it! Now you're officially better than most people. Thanks! What did you just say? ....I said thanks? Oh no, we don't say that in L.A. She needs a little bit - She needs an attitude class. Yeah, you can't have manners... What do you mean you can't have manners? *music* James, you gotta be excused. Since you don't have normal human emotion. *Laughing* What!? Also, James has only been here a year and a half. So he hasn't updated as well as we might have. We have a nice one point five years on him Which is a lot in L.A. time. Like sixty years off your life. There's a few things you need to know *music* You know like how to act. In certain situations here in L.A. The first exercise were gonna start with is asking you questions that you will frequently get asked. Here in the city of Los Angeles. *annoyingly* So what do you do? I'm a YouTuber! No no no, say like ""you know -i-i- i um"" Like talk about what you actually do in your normal life, rather than your profession. Like I film a video once a week and- No- like how do you make money? ...from YouTube. James: *Ehhhh!* wrong Mind you I just met you two minutes ago. How do you make money? - and like how much? Can I lie and say I'm not a YouTuber? Yeah, you don't wanna say that you're a YouTuber because *whooshing noise* You get disrespected for that. You can pretty much do anything besides- YouTube. James: You have to answer with a job were they can't ask you any further questions. That's so true! James: I am going to rejoin this conversation- (gibberish) Wanna sit on my lap daddy? Get on here baby There's something that you'll learn when you're -Um- Four!? And your parents tell you Never ask someone how much money they make. Like I remember in first grade, they did like a take your parent to work day. or whatever it is... So you take your parent to school and they like explain there job. And my teacher told me - When I was in first grade and six years old- ""Don't ask how much money they make."" And ever since that day I know to not ask someone how much money they make But... I get frequently asked, "" How much money I make?"" Every single adult in this city!! It's just weird. When you move to L.A. people will think you've ""changed"" Okay, well I mean obviously very clearly haven't. Yeah I don't know why they would think that? Thank you hunny *screams* OH! what is that bug on the ground right there?! That was not vegan... Okay so people are going to expect you to change And when they ask you, ""Did you change?"" What are you gonna say? Of course not. I'm still the same bitch! I think I'm a little too nice."

Let's make it our own little fun game so let's see if Emma becomes shallow game We're finally here, my, mom's driving the rental car Because i'm not allowed to drive because i'm not 25 yet you can't see My, mom she doesn't really like being on camera that much you, want to just kind of poke your head in oh Gotcha, bitch! For starters I'm exhausted I got like Three hours of sleep last night because i was just kind of fucking around You know i was getting crazy, and having fun on the interwebs before i went to bed so Don't act like you haven't done the same thing is is this accent offensive please don't Get offended i don't even know, what accent it is you can't get mad at, me if i don't know, what it means okay? Also it's nice and foggy here in la right now, which is really nice because i personally really, like, that i just ate My entire Asian box and forgot to freaking film it. I forgot to film it. So will this act like i'm eating it right now *Music* Going into our first apartment i don't really like This, area so this is probably all just kind of one why is a screen like that Just probably just a lost cause because i don't even like it but we're gonna look anyway. So let's see how it goes Update let, me get in the car before i start talking shit. Just got out of the first tour and i did not like- Mommy? hahaha Oh my God my mom just hit her head on my camera Are you okay? Are you sure? ""No"" There is a really ripped buff guy running right there ""Oh shiii-haha"" We just finished touring our first apartment. I hated it. I did not like it and like the guy i told him i was like i just want to check out the apartment and he was like you want to check out the amenities i was like you know what? We kind of have a crammed schedule today, probably not gonna check out the amenities he's like ""Okay no problem"" And then he starts showing us all the fucking amenities we're almost  there for a goddamn hour And I didn't like it. I knew the I didn't like it the second I stepped foot in. And he's showing us everything"" the pool Was like the size of a bathtub"" It was a piece of shit and the rent is like *Mom laughing in background* The rent for this house, overall i'd raid this apartment a fucking two out of ten it Was just shit it was so bad. So we will not be moving into that one uh-huh we're Gonna probably, go to one or two other ones today but honestly They are so Annoying the way that they are in there i just don't even know if i could even do one more like They're, just they show. You everything it's like, bitch show, me the fucking apartment Like, don't show, me all this added shit if i don't even know if i like the apartment yet, also if they, ask You, hey, do you, want to see the amenities? No i don't Well then don't fucking show, me them And i'm saying like i can see your pool as the size of a bathtub from the outside you don't need To, walk, me by it bitch Update, we decided that we're not gonna visit any more apartments in this area because We don't really like it it would be good for somebody who's like 25 and up but i am 17 i am ripe um so Laughing at my, own joke like the little conceited bitch that i am i would show The apartments but i feel, like, then the people Who are giving us the tour would be like put that camera away, you fucking suspicious bitch, also there's a pressed Juicery right there ""well the markets right over here so we can come back later"" why, can't we go right now? ""Yea we can go now"" Ew that was  weird i was like? Like out of impulse like, i didn't mean to do it Looks, good i guess even though i would like more almond butter, and like, what's that liquid right there like i don't know ""Slurping* Mukbang *More slurping* That eye roll talk about teen rebellion you are so high maintenance ""Maybe you can live in that building right there"" ""Or that one over there"" And getting fucking murdered let's see a, little air bnb tour shall we? Ew. So outside we have this nice little table, we have this nice flat screen, along with A little fuck, why is it not focused along with this. Cute little dining room table continuing it you have a little cute little thing Right here continuing, we have our own little personal kitchen, where, we can cook, whatever We want. I mean that's the whole point of a fucking kitchen, but, sure there's, also cool, little foods Which is rare washer and dryer just in case i shit my pants a. Cute little all-white bathroom with. A, mirror, there's me Last but not least We have the little bed that me and my mom are gonna share which kind of sucks but i mean whatever Oh, yeah i know, well best can, let's see what's in here oh my? God a little closet this place is awesome and then there's this mirror what's up guys Fuck....... Fuck Hope you enjoyed my airbnb tour i'm gonna take a nap now i'm very tired i got three hours of sleep last, night please, feel, bad for me so, what are we thinking. ""i think like 3c-"" Think, like 3c cool, darkest brown will be really good and fresh for your hair, we also have 4 dark, brown, natural but this One has a cool, anti brass Things do you, think it's, gonna be good and fresh yes It was 100%. James's idea to dye, my hair, today, and he's just not even in the room for this moment. This is gonna be good. I think this will be really hot. I Hope it's good do you, think it'll get a boyfriend from this, no, oh, maybe really I've just tried Everything at this point and i just know That my look, isn't great, so i'm just we're very much the same people right i think we're finding out throughout Today right over there if it's not one for you it's not gonna work for me i mean just by the Series of unfortunate events, we both incurred through our lives right i know something probability is gonna get any higher see a lot cuter Okay, so i mean you're already cute i think this will be really very fresh, new Look, for you but if i go, bald i mean that'll also
Be good for content and clicks Lots of good content and clicks good fresh fresh and clean content how's it but you know i'm scared i don't even want to look anymore I knew I had made a big mistake Oh my god look at that. this is great. haha Sorry, james didn't mean to get dye all over your nice white tiles. Hehe There you go! I literally wet everywhere like i have water everywhere.  i'm so excited. i'm soaking wet everywhere but, i think it's worth it ""We love a wet sister we love a slippery sister."" we love a slippery sister Okay, I look like fucking severus snape Day two apartment hunting i have new hair i hate it good morning so yeah i don't know James talked me into that last night am i regretting it slightly because my blue eyes are a little- are  blue My hair is black, and with a little bit like megan fox, so i'm trying to see the positive in this situation Who's gonna, tell, her that she just doesn't look, like megan fox, oh god My mom fucking hates it hates it she hates it she's so angry she wants to fucking choke me to death, why Don't you come over here mother and give your opinion, UGLY!!!! Yeah, she thinks it's ugly, so that's always good you know, when you like? Dye your hair and you come home to mom you're, like, what are you thinking literally I like turned on the light she was like, no that's horrible i was like Okay, you know, what it doesn't look, that, bad from this angle? Look, and they look in the viewfinder it's not that bad it's not that, bad like i look More like older and goth but it's not that bad see like at. This angle Am I goth now? What? I'm wearing yellow glasses. I'm wearing plaid I look so much like an egg No you don't , oh, my god no it makes my head look like an egg. It makes your chin, look Super sharp. ewwww. Is that one is that the whole megan fox thing cuz You're, it's like Megan Fox book is it like, yeah but you have to show, me a picture cuz I can't picture what she looks like Oh, yeah,Do I look like Megan Fox? Well if you did your makeup you probably totally, would If I was just a little bit more genetically gifted I would look like- ""No no"" It's just it's just that what mommy i don't think Megan Fox and also to like the coverage it just there's so many places Where it didn't even get on the hair, okay, well let's not. And then there's like, so much left on your scalp Yea okay it's a fucking mess Hey, guys, you might be like, Emma you didn't vlog all, day, and that is true i didn't um? We visited four apartments today it took like 30 hours sometimes you'll set foot in an apartment and you'll be like immediately no But instead of like kind of dropping out and being like nah never mind i'm good like you can't do that you have to finish The tour, and these tours take, like an hour, and half the time you know You're, doing this little small talk, you're just like so you know, uh are you, from the area and it gets really old? We actually found like one apartment that is solid move-in ready i would move into it would you mm-hmm Thank, you if it was in a different place okay, um she's problematic, we applied, so we'll see i'll get back to you, guys We'll see how it goes i just posted an instagram photo with, my, new, like black hair and everybody's like, emma What the fuck are you doing and i'm asking the same thing what am i doing, why is my hair black What is happening with my life? Am I having a crisis the answer is yes just in case i didn't make it clear enough right there yes i am having A crisis it's like kind of sad like my hair is now black just in time for summer Don't look under the tan maybe it'll look just tell, me it'll look, good with a tan It will look good with a tan if i'm tan and my, eyes are like, blue it'll, like pop yeah Anyway, um i wanted to vlog some of these apartments that i'm checking out but i feel so uncomfortable because it's such a professional affair And i want to make myself look, good so if i whip out A camera, and i'm like i'm moving to LA, and i'm a Youtuber then they'll be like yeah, okay, so we will not be accepting her application like i'll just describe some of them We have bedrooms in them and they usually have kitchens and windows so if you think that's good enough you think They get it the area that i'm potentially moving into i'm not, gonna say, where it is or else all like i don't know You, guys will find me and like kill Me like to slice my head off or something which is like good i mean sometimes i wish somebody? Would do that to me but it's not it's something i want to invite into, my life, also like half the reason Why i'm moving is because of some issues Which i can't really get into until i move but when i move we'll do a nice big story time should i do that About the thing that happened to me you think that can, be some big clickbait right there but, it wouldn't even be clickbait It's not safe to talk about it yet isn't that so cool, not safe for me to talk, about it yet get ready for the video No, but it actually isn't safe for me to talk about yet cuz If i'm living still, where i'm living and i just said story time and the person, who it's about, who i don't even know Who it is i don't know, who the person is they get angry, they will try to kill me you know What i'm saying so it's like let's be a little girl i have like period cramps but i'm not on my period Oh, my, god let's see if i have a tampon in i have this Weird phobia of like leaving tampons in and like not remembering to take it out And then like a week going, by and the tampons still being in there so um Fuck i'm literally gonna, die alone i'm so fucking disgusting What's up guys? Day 3 of- *GPS interrupts her* ""North-point setting in place"" Day 3 of apartment hunting you know what we're not doing, good we're not thriving my Lips are so chapped i look like i have two lip injections, feel like i'm finally fitting into the LA Culture with, my fat, ass lips they're, not even fat they're just red Maybe i have like herpes or something so today we're visiting more apartments in a different area there is just so many areas i think today is a Promising, day the area that we're visiting today has a lot of promising options. I mean i'd say that that's good You know got my coffee in here little styrofoam cup Horrible for the environment would not recommend i can't wait for me to actually pick out My apartment and then show it to you because i feel really, bad cuz, i'm like, yeah guys checking out apartments And then i'm like, not showing You anything you know, what i mean it's kind of rude but i guess it's youtube these? Days it's all talk and no show. You know, what i mean? That's ok, though? What have i been doing for the past few hours Looking at apartments what have i not been doing filming them or showing you them at all We visited two hated them both with a, burning passion the guy, who, was showing us these apartments Was wearing acid-washed jeans i was like this is bad he, also had to yorkies cute but concerning you know Feel like you could be literally parking that parking lot They, would never know i'm trying to talk my mom into doing illegal activities today's been quite a, day Oh, god this is scary what, where are, we? This is probably the worst video i've, ever made. Nahhh. You know? *Burps* Ew"

What in the fuck is that? but I'm gonna keep it because I think it's kinda funny. Okay. So, just got to the airport in Montreal. 'Montreal'. Is it 'Montreol' or 'Montreal'? and I met some baes. And I meet some baes. They came here for me. like how special is that Like, how special is that. I don't deserve them. I  don't deserve them, and you're gonna meet them right now and you're gonna meet them right now. Name and a fun fact, alright? Name and a fun fact, alright? ""Name and a fun fact? I have no clue what the fuck I was thinking."" ""This girl over here is just like, ""Bitch. Name and a fun fact? This is not middle school."""" this girl over here is just like: ""b*tch name and a fun fact, this is not middle school"" ""I can't be the only one who had to do that type of activity in middle school."" i can't be the only one who had to do that type of activity in middle school ""and her friend is even more like, ""Oh, why the fuck did I even try to say hi to this bitch. SHE'S FUCKIN' INSANE!"""" and her friend is just even more just like ""oh, why the f**k did i try to say hi to this b*tch she's f**kin insane HAHA *AHAHA* ""Moral of the story is: I hate myself. I don't know why I miss out on these social cues. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to function in social situations."" ""I'm Carly, I've been doing dance for, like, 11 years."" ""My name is Gillie and I'm friends with Carly."" *HAHAHA* Yo, that must be fuckin' sick to have friends and to have, like, the friends be like: ""This is my friend"", like, that doesn't happen to me. ""My name is Sheera, I am friends with Gillie, I guess."" *ohmahgawd* I think at this point they're just bragging about the fact that they're all friends (Scoffs) We get it. Y'know? Hmmph. Da fuq. Like, it's fine if you're all friends, just invite me to be in the squad. It's not a big fuckin deal. (Scoffs) You could just invite me and be, like, (Muttering) ""Hey, come to lunch one time with ussss"", like, it'sss not that hard ""You seem lonely, let's hang out."" Y'know. I'm pretty nice, I mean, like, I'm kinda pushy. I'm not too clingy. I'm pretty easy to be friends with. (Audio of kids cheering) ""Hi, I'm Angel, and I don't know what to say because I'm boring."" ""Hi, I'm Catherine, I don't know."" We're in theee... taxi. I slept the entire time on the plane. All 6 hours *Deep breath* of the flight, um I'm here for Elle Mills' tour. She's a Canadian, she is a local. She's gonna show me around for the five minutes that I'm gonna be here. I've never done any kinda, like, shows, or anything like this. I'm excited, I'm pumped. Y'know, love trying new things in my life. Oh yeah, I'm really sweaty. Um, did I say that already? Why are you staring at the camera? I'm leavin' it in. Elle: You scared the shit out of me. Get over here. Are you ready? Elle: I'm scared. It's gonna burn a little bit. *Elle moans a little* Doesn't that burn really bad? Oh, it's gonna work Elle: I love that you have your airpods in. Oh my God, yeah, but I can hear you. They're not even working. I'm just doing this for the effect. Elle: *laughs* *Oddly very peppy voice* I'll see you tomorrow! Elle: Bye, I'll miss you. Hey! I'll miss you... Elle: Is that-? No, that's great. Elle: ...cool. *Both laugh* *Grind on me plays* Good morning! Today is the big day. Today is the day we've all been waiting for. Look at my hair. This is... not good. Yeah, I hope you guys are having the best day of your life so far. If today isn't the best day of your life, then you're doing something wrong. You're doing something wrong and you're a piece of shit, so don't forget that. So, here's the game plan for today, 'cause I know you guys LOVE that. And I know that that's the huge... vlogging... yes. Just something you should always do in your vlog, is tell everyone what you're gonna do even though you're also going to SHOW everyone what you're gonna do, so... For starters.... we're gonna go down to the lobby, and then we're gonna, um, get some... So that's the plan for today! This is my little get ready with me. I'm not doing any makeup, or anything, for this event. Because, ya know what, I've kinda gotten to that point in my life where I'm, like, ""Don't even TRY."" Okay? Ya know what, prolly should've tried a LITTLE bit harder Because I look like I have a fucking penis Ummm... I look like a boy. Eghh... This is kinda ugly. Whatever, I've already decided I don't care. *Super loud OHHH* Also, I ended up ordering food last night. And it was honestly, not good. Which is rare. I know I said I went to bed but I actually postmated food and THEN went to bed. Soo... *In ASMR kind of voice* Gotta be clear with you guys. Don't wanna lie on the internet. Y'know? I've never, like, ordered food to my house and then had it come and me be, like, ""eh"", ""This actually is not good."" And then that happened last night, but you know what? I'm not gonna be a negative Nelly. And instead, I'm gonna be a positive Patty. And I'm gonna lie to you. poop di scoop Right now. I'm gonna lie and I'm gonna actually say that it was really good. So, let's try that again. Hello, everyone! Ordered food last night, it was awesome. It was SO good. Seemed like it had been warmed up in a microwave twenty minutes before it was so good. I should probably brush my teeth, just as a courtesy to those who will be around me. Should I put moisturizer on my face? Yes. Now my face feels oily. Prolly shouldn't have put on moisturizer. Whatever, it'll sink in. My skin's like a fuckin' sponge, it'll soak up anything you put on it. Like a little bitch. No, now it's really oily. Lemme show you what I'm drinking right now. *applause* This lil 'Pop & bottle'. Mocha, cold brew coffee with almond milk. I'm not gonna lie to you guys. You guys are in the pinch. This is pretty good. *iconic slurping audio* *smacking lips* I mean, it's a little gross, but like, what isn't these days? I use *bleeeep* Wait, I'm not gonna tell you what brand I use. Just in case they wanna sponsor me. Ya know what, I'm a brand friendly queen now. I don't do anything for free Nothing's for free anymore. *applause* I only do things with the intentions of money now. I am no longer genuine. I don't care about your feelings. Just kidding, I use Sensodyne. Ummm... Don't even try to sponsor me. It's just... f*ckin'... a waste of your time. You don't wanna work with me. *sighs* I'm using reverse psychology right now. And it's WORKING. 'Cause Sensodyne is in my email right now. I bet. I mean, I BET. Because reverse psychology has never failed me in my life. But I'm like if a boy is like YoU'rE f*CkInG UgLy I'm like YeAh I aM aNd YoU dOn'T wAnT tHiS D*Ck YoU KnOw WhAT I mEaN? And they're like... yOu'Re RiGhT. And i'm like... YoU'rE LyInG tO YoUrSeLf And then they're like... *realizing their mistake* Oh Sh*T YoU'rE rIgHt... I'm In LoVe WiTh YoU And i'm like... yEaH yOu ArE I don't know is that like illegal? Like to do that to someone? I can't tell also that only worked with me in fifth grade. It hasn't worked for me since. Let's see if Sensodyne slid in with that freakin' brand deal email right here. let's seeeee... alright guyssss... alriiiiiiiiight. there's enough of me- there's enough of me to go around everybody yeah, umm... sooooo... sooo, there is not *yhm* an email. no email from sensodyne *tries to poke her brain* Yes, I did just kinda pick my nose which I didn't even get out a booger, so I don't know if it counts as picking. but I did have a little itch in there and I did do that sOO hope you don't mind. *spits* Fess up. What did you just do? Emma's mom: ""I was watching a video about a squirrel..."" Wait now, the heater just turned on. Now no one can hear you. Emma's mom: ""I was watching a video about a squirrel and... I realized that we were running late.."" My mom has this bad habit of watching facebook videos. Usually about animals like five minutes before we have to leave for somewhere and then we're always late. It's just-st It's this really, really vicious cycle. This is why I don't bring my mOM anywhere. Do ya know what, I don't even know what I'm talking about. I do take my mom everywhere *applause* turn off the camera Yeah I call her mommy still I'm kinda growing out of it though 'cause lately she's been pissing me off I'm like you're losing that privilege, queen. You know what I mean? Hi! I'm Elle Mills and welcome to our VIP. Well, look here! We have lighting and that's it! *laughing* ohmygawd! *in oddly perky voice* It's gonna be me up there. What did the ocean... the microphone's not on... What did the ocean say to the sand? It didn't, it just waved. *really. really forced laughter.* *applause* Ladies and gentelmen, please welcome... EMMA CHAMBERLAIN!! *screaming* *everybody talks by neon trees plays* I wanna die. That is the most cringe thing I've ever seen myself do and I've done a lot of cringe stuff *weird moaning noises?? idk at this point* *sound of regret* *applause* So, what are we eatin' today? ""We have a canadian delicacy... poutine"" Elle: ""Cheese curds and gravy."" Oh my god it looks- okay, but like chEESE CURDS?? Elle: ""If you don't like cheese..."" No, I LOVE cheese but like, curd? Elle: ""yeah... mMmMM"" *laughing* Okay, let's try it. I'm like genuinely scared for my life. Elle: ""Do you like gravy?"" I've never even tried gravy. Elle: ""Okay, then this might be a problem."" It smells really good. That tastes good like, I don't think you can hate that Elle: ""You just had a fry though.."" Elle: ""It's okay to say you don't like it"" That is good. Elle: ""Is it?"" Emma: ""Yeah!"" Elle: ""To me it's a no"" No, it's just *80 year old laugh* It's not bad I probably give it like a 6 out of 10 because it's like 100% EdIbLe Elle: ""OkAy"" That was my ""poutyn"" rev-, ""putin?"" Can you help me say it? Elle: ""poutine"" That was my ""poutine"" review Is it good? YEAH Is it bad? NO Is it okay? *slight nod* YES *Elle laughs* So I never ended thisss... video... And you probably like: ""Emma, you're f**king crazy."" And you do right about that So, let me finish it up. The reason why I didn't vlog on the way home is because... the traveling home experience was extremely traumatic and I will try to sum it up as quickly as possible because it's 3 am, my mom is sleeping in the other room and you guys don't need a long explanation. But you do wanna know a little bit, I bet because that's what content is all about information that won't help you in life, just stuff that's kind of added sh*t that's like relatively entertaining and probably not even entertaining at all anyway. To sum it up: My flights was booked for me by somebody else, I didn't book my own flights for this trip and so.... There is a little bit of a mistake.... My mom's flight was perfect. It was booked for the correct date and all of that. My was accidentally booked fOr A dAy LaTeRrr then it was supposed to be so show up to airport ready for my flight aaand they're like... yAaH sOoOOo... Your flight is actually tomorrow at the exact same time and that was a mistake. Which is funny because my mom is the one that was the guest on this trip. She didn't even need to be there. She was just there because I was like: ""I'm a pussy"" ""please help me"" I'm the actually one that needed to be in Canada annnnnddd.... *lip smack* but that's what's not the point so anyway. It was very intense to get that fixed because the flight was literally going to take off any minute and we were trying to change around the flight info, like 2 minutes before. *over it sigh* It was a lot. Okay? But long story short our flight ended up being delayed 3 hours so we were more than on time and not only that there were only 11 people on my flight on a plane with over 100 seats. Does this make sense? Is this processing to you? Everybody got their own row, we got to watch movies on the plane. I watched some great movies. I watched ""I, Tonya"", which is a good movie or  ""Tounya"", ""Tanya"", I think it's ""Tanya"" It wouln't be ""Tounya"", that just wouldn't make any sense even though I thought that the ""Tonya"" was spelled with an ""A"" instead of an ""O"", but... Guess that's not my business also I watched ""Lady Bird"" cried my ass off during both. It was a great experience, so... yes, it was a little bit (buacky?) but we made it work. The thing that was really truly traumatic is that once I landed I was waiting outside with my mom for our car to pick us up and take us home and we almost got mugged so that was k00l. Some guy was like checking me and my mom out,  we were like: hMMm, tHiS iS wEiRd, BuT WhAtEvER mAyBe He Is JuSt BeInG CrEePy FoR nO rEaSoN. Yeah, after of few minutes with this guy ss-walking in circles around my mom and I, staring at us and our bags. He disappears inside of the airport and the security guard comes over to us the security guard was like: ""Yeah, we have a issues with people getting mugged outside of the airport at night you guys are probably gunna get mugged."" and I was like that's hella swaaaaaag good story for the kids, and ... that's that then after that, our car came, picked us up. We went home. We went to bed and everything was well. Fast forward to a few days ago I decide to go to the apple store and buy a new laptop so that I could edit on the go and you know start pumping out more content, being the youtuber that y'all want me to be. Spent way to much money on this piece of sh*t but *ermm* despite I start editing on this new computer Actually the video that you are watching currently right now and the computer just completely fucks up and glitches and like deletes half of the videooo doesn't really make any sense so now here we are trying to not have the video get deleted again which I probably will so if you're seeing this that means that I've defied all odds of nature and I figured a way to edit this video and get it out without it being deleted by my video editor not video editor meaning like somebody sitting here and editing for me because unlike most youtubers, I actually edit my own videos because I actually don't want to pay somebody else to do it so... It's also very creative for me, it's a very big creative outlet so I obviously do it myself. I'm talking about my video editing software program on my computer. If I manage to defy all odds and actually get it to cooperate with me then you're seeing the video and that means that I'm God. I'm literally Jesus Christ himself. That's the end of this video, editing this has been a very long process because my computer is not cooperating and not only that. I'm also just kind of a piece of shit so that's a part of it as well. *loudest sigh* AND I think that's everything that I just wanted to get out of my mouth that's kind of why I'm a mess. Everybody's probably clicked off at this point anyway. I'm literally speaking into these Apple headphones like not even my EarPods so trashy *sigh* sorry It's 3 am, pulling an all nighter, drinkin' a coffee you guys are getting the real raw, nest of this (idk) you guys have never seen me at this point but here it is, it's me doing thissss. This is what you don't see and now you're fucking seeing it, fucking trippy *tries to take a sip while laying down* *tries not to choke while laying down* How was that?

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2018-05-30T01:12:23Z,237719,4826753,14115,"I now make videos in bed and this is the peak of my career. Okay, or maybe the downfall you tell me Hey guys, what's up? Hope you all are doing absolutely Amazing. I hope you're doing great. So today is May 23rd. I turned 17 yesterday surprisingly I know I don't look like it, but we don't need to talk about that Okay, and I realized that I am still so young My opinions on things are probably gonna change by the time I turn 20 or even 30 or even 40 or even 50 and I thought you know, Emma that's a very insightful thought you are so smart and you are so powerful And I thought you know what? It might be really interesting to document my opinions on things topics in life while I'm at this young and ripe age of 17 So that when I'm older I can look back and see what I thought about things when I was 17 So I went on my favorite social media platform Twitter and I said, hey guys let me know some stuff that you want to know my opinions on and you guys just Absolutely went off. So hope you enjoy coz we're in bed You know what? This is my 17th year of life and I'm not gonna hide this shit anymore I'm not gonna set up my fucking camera and sit in a chair when I could literally film in my bed Like I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. This is genius my future husband out there. Hopefully they're watching this love you cutie Like this is what its gonna be like to be married to me I'm kind of hungry right now, but whatever, thoughts on global warming and You know, I'll die soon enough and like I won't be affected by it so (screaming fans) You know what though? I fucking love polar bears and I I'm sad about that like polar bears are really fucking cute I'd really hop on the back of one of those and just ride that shit around if I could opinion on Pineapple and pizza, you know what? I don't fucking care I've never tried it and I bet it's good. I bet it's great. But I also like don't care Like if it was placed in front of me, and I would 100% eat it. I'm not opposed But like why would you eat pineapple pizza when you could have like a nice slice of cheese? I feel like throwing a bunch of shit on pizza just eat cheese pizza and shut up, you know what I mean? It's like stop being like that. Stop being so something like that youtubers you don't like so number one I'm putting this in so I can click bait my video as this. Oh wait. No should I do that? No, I'm not gonna click bait my video with this, you know what my morals aren't all that bad anyway Because I don't have any youtubers I don't like yet Comment down below some youtubers that you think I should hate because I haven't really decided I mean, obviously, you know, we have the basic Jake Paul Logan Paul Lele pons But I mean like everyone hates those that's just like a default thing that you're born with like you're born hating them That's not tea Like we've been knew about that sis you feel me do you know what I just realized that youtubers? You don't like that's not me sharing my opinion on that. That's it. That's like a question (Vsauce music) Whatever I don't care. was the moon landing real that's a question that is not an opin- That's not something you want my opinion on but I will instead give my opinion on the moon landing moon landing Amazing big step for Humanity. I appreciate it. I I personally have no interest in landing on the moon myself A lot of people are like what am I goals is to like land on the moon one day I just don't think that that would do anything for me Same thing with like skydiving like I just have no interest I enjoy like staying on that like I love having my feet on the ground. I love the feeling of dirt under my feet I love the feeling of the asphalt on my little toes. I love that but that wasn't what you said You want my opinion on the moon landing? Do I think it was real? Of course not (Vsauce music) But despite who cares whether it was real or not America said it's true and whatever the government says is correct and is right Conspiracy theories and the Mandela effect, you know what everyone needs to shut up about both? I'm sick of it I'm sick of it. Oh my god. I have like neighbors like I forget about that sometimes conspiracy Theories are thing or I think are really interesting and I like looking into them But it's one of those things that I research on the side and I don't talk about it with others because it's just over discussed at this point like if I Let's talk about something fresh Mandela effect is the one conspiracy theory. Is that even a conspiracy theory? Not really? Maybe ok the Mandela effect I'm so sick of it. People are just reaching for the Mandela effect I like when things are kind of like oh only few people know about it, but now everyone knows about it Just shut up about it. And do your fucking homework Oh Laurel and Yanny. Ah another thing everyone needs to shut up about people get one thing and they just Juice it until everyone is just like tell me but for the record I hear, yanny Comment down below what you hear thoughts on AP classes when I was in high school before I graduated Big tea right there. Everybody thinks I dropped out of school. I did not actually graduated early So stop spreading rumors and bullying me. Stop bullying me I always took a lot of AP and honors classes cuz I was trying to be like some sort of crazy bitch It was very unhealthy balance it out and don't overdo it or else you'll want to die. Like I did I was very depressed Premarital sex God and religion thank God you guys have some good topics that will create a lot more traction for my channel This will hopefully make it so that more people will click premarital sex. You know what I can't even speak on the topic I'm a fucking vir- For my younger fans if you are under 12, no sex Do you know what there's no. Is my cat in my closet. Holy shit. Wait Oh my god Kitty, what the fuck? My cat was limp. Oh my god. I am such a bad person My cat has been in the closet that entire time. Okay, I'll explain, I can explain myself. I leave my closet open a lot Oh, hi kitty My cat likes to just sit in my closet for some reason Sometimes I'll like not look before I close my closet and he'll just be in there and I won't know about it and like hours Will pass and he'll just be okay never hours. I am NOT do not call the Humane Society I literally am like emotionally reliant on him. You cannot take him away from me. My little baby You literally cannot take him away from me. I will put myself in jail if you like Okay, whatever. So where were we god? We're about to get really deep right here. Okay. God is not one person God is not two people but God is three people and it is the Jonas Brothers and I've known it this whole time Religion I'm Your opinion on build-a-bears, you know what this is actually a great question when I was younger I was obsessed with build-a-bear I wanted to go in there everyday if it was up to me and I ended up collecting probably three of them and you know What my opinion on build-a-bear is that they're fucking tricking you you go in to build-a-bear and you think that you're gonna use that bear Everyday, you think you're gonna snuggle with that little bitch. You think you're gonna fucking play around with that little $90.00 bear. Okay your build-a-bear will be shoved under your bed and you'll never see it again It's fun to make it. It's fun when you're in there But once you leave the build-a-bear store the bear means nothing to you. It is just an expensive hobby Just go over here. Dude. Anybody who like talks shit on these cookies is like lying Dude, these cookies are good. A lot of people would argue that they're the backbone of our society and I would agree Have you ever gone to a birthday party and not eaten one of these? No, have you ever gone to a school related function and not seen these? No, have you ever gone to a Saint Patrick's Day party and not seen it like no, it's the book. Oh my god Hey guys back in business. What's your opinion on people who use their phone in the shower? Why do you need to do that? Well, number one. You can't even use your phone in the shower unless it's waterproof So you probably have an Otterbox, which don't even get me started on OtterBox's I'm not gonna lie I did want one when I was in like fifth grade, so I guess I can't like really talk shit on it What's your thought on used bookstores with creepy old men that own it asking for a friend? I can guarantee you are not asking for a friend and that you actually do often encounter a creepy man who owns a bookstore and what I have to tell you is do you need a summer job because you could Send him feet pics For money. Starbucks coffee Starbucks wanna sponsor me money can change any opinion on the Internet and that is fact But Starbucks coffee tastes like battery fluid. It tastes like acid. It tastes like gasoline and it is not good But if you live in an area where you can't necessarily find a little coffee shop Starbucks is all you have aka you live in Delaware or some shit the middle of the state? No one cares about And you all you have is Starbucks, you know What is cereal considered soup don't overthink it like that opinion on your XD phase if you had one sadly my XD phase is still Continuing I still do use the words XD more than I should. I think it's the reason why Lot of boys.h Don't talk to me. It's not even a joke anymore It's serious now because it's a part of my vocabulary and when I'm typing quickly It just slips out. furries, if by the time I'm 30, and I'm not married I will consider becoming a furry to find companionship fennel/dill very serious topic I need your opinion on the disgusting herbs immediately. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa disgusting. Let's talk about this sis.Fennel I think I had it in a salad a few times and I don't hate it. Put it in the right dish and it can change your life eat it by itself. That might be gross. Don't ask me sis I don't fucking know. Next dill I'm personally a very big fan of pickles and my favorite kind of pickle is of course a dill pickle. I hate sweet pickles They're literally eating them as a sin in my opinion I would like to have your profound input on the topic of memes I think that memes are something that should be shown to one another sent to one another but never talked about out loud Spongebob you brought to me like squeezing. My like cat's fat He's just really fat parents who don't allow their kids to watch Spongebob as a child don't want their kids to grow up and be funny my parents didn't want me to watch Spongebob at first because all of the parents were buzzing being like spongebob is rots your kid's Brain, like I don't know why that was a rumor. I loved seeing SpongeBob's butt cheeks Like there was no issue with that for me marriage. What a concept. I think that being married could be really fun but I also think it's a little bit stupid most likely there's someone out there in the world that's better for you than whoever you Married, which is a scary thought but regardless I'm probably gonna get married and I'm probably gonna have a really corny wedding Maybe I'll make it Star Wars themed even though I've never seen Star Wars But I feel like that could still be a fun theme, you know, everyone dresses up is like yedi's Is that what they're called Jedda? Yeah, Jedi's yedi's Yoda um dark Vader Darth Vader I don't fucking scrambled eggs if they are liquidy they can ruin your day liquidy eggs are Disappointing, I like my eggs almost burnt because that's the way that it doesn't make me gags eggs are disgusting to me They're also kind of good at the same time and it's like upsetting cuz I've never been able to decide how I truly feel about Eggs more the story is it's a touchy subject for me, and it's a little bit triggering cardi B I I I hate I actually like some of her songs finesse by Cardi B  and like Bruno Mars slaps major The things that I say even shocked me and like I'm the one who said them and like that's not good You know if corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables What is baby oil, made out of if I was a true comedian? I would say babies, but I'm not so sheep mineral oil. ghosts Spirits I want to believe it because I want to be a ghost and for that come test me bitches I'm gonna regret that the 1929 stock market crash. It was hard for me going through that at the time I personally wasn't affected. Why did it take you so long to your first brand deal because I'm a piece of shit What's your favorite meme right now? A lot of you guys have probably not heard of this one, but I've been really digging this meme That's kind of it's so funny I've never really seen a meme like it and it like affects me in a different way like it's funny but it also like makes me think you know what I mean and I appreciate that about a meme in the main that I've been really liking is the one that's like why you know It's so funny opinions on anime I heard that all anime is like porn I'm afraid because I made fun of it my whole life. And so now that I'm older and it's actually cool to watch anime I'm afraid of that like somehow because of that exchange I'll die communism for all you idiots who don't know what communism is or haven't like gone through the seventh grade yet No one's richer than the other and so I think it'd be great if we had some Communism going on in America because that would mean that everyone got Gucci slides going to the bathroom therapeutic Important quality time for you and yourself. I love taking a shit. Oh my god. I'm tired I've been filming for like a year and a half curse words Imagine being like hey, I don't like you when you could be like hey fuck you It just it adds up that you need when you  when you just like, you know what I mean. Will you be my girlfriend? This is not a topic for my video and this is actually a question and because of that I will not be your girlfriend But if you would have said opinion on what it would be like to be my girlfriend we would could have really done something there Do you think that Miley Cyrus was Hannah Montana? That is the stupidest thing. No, Emma. Do you have a boyfriend? We want the good tea sis No, If I had a boyfriend I'd definitely tell you guys comment down below. I think I should date anyone who it should be Maybe even harass people and tell them to be my boyfriend. It's up to you help a sister out Yeah, what's on my lip? Is that like a like birthmark? Yeah, but comment down below who should I should date and then like harass them telling them to date me? that'd be like really like handy isn't it's like almost like I don't have to like I don't have to do anything then like it's All I used to be like, oh fuck like it on those. Oh my all my friends We're just telling you that you should date me But like that doesn't mean that I think that like that doesn't mean that like I could like blame it on you guys, too And it's like good and like easy for me. So he has to go harass people It won't make me like look bad if they don't know that this like this conversation is happening Get me a boyfriend like I believe in you"

*THIS VIDEO IS SPONSORED BY CUROLOGY*",2018-05-22T21:07:56Z,141435,2018244,8378,"Hello and welcome to my first brand deal I'm very nervous right now as you guys probably know my channel is not necessarily brand friendly Getting brand deals has not been an easy thing for me not only has it not been easy, but it also hasn't been possible Hahaha, but out of the kindness of their hearts curology has decided to sponsor today's video and I'd just like to give a big round Of applause the curology for sponsoring me and really taking one for the team because they didn't have to do that So let's just give them a moment Love you guys, so let's get into the details. The funny thing about curology is that I actually already used the product I've actually been using curology for like nine months. Let me go get my bottle to prove to you that I use it Okay, this is not fake. This is spons This is spons but I actually use this which is kind of funny because like that kind of defeats the purpose of a brand deal like I would Have promoted them for free, but we've got to get that money. So it's okay If you didn't believe me, here's my bottle of curology. I'll put it right here so that you don't forget About it. I found curology because my skin was so bad. It was not cute (sad music) (cheering) And I have tried everything I tried Proactiv I tried like all these other weird  I can't cuss all these other weird um acne remedies like nothing was working and then my mom found a curology and forced me to sign up and I am so glad That she did because now my skin is not as you can see Thank You cure ology now I must say it wasn't perfect overnight. I didn't just wake up. My skin was clear It took a few months but after a few months My skin was like so bomb and I was getting a lot of comments like Emma. What the did you I can't cuss though I just cussed again. See I'm not brand friendly curology. Thank you for putting up with me Like this is really sweet of you guys Everybody was commenting on my videos being like about your skin is so much better. You guys really damn wait Can I say damn, is that like appropriate the cool thing about? Serology is that every bottle is like different like it's not like the same for everyone Each person has like a custom prescription formula. Those are big words. You're paired with a dermatology provider Yeah, like they like make you feel special Oh and they're there to just answer all of your skin questions and prescribe you your own special little formula with Prescription I'm slightly illiterate ingredients mixed just for your skin I can't believe I just said all those big words that was like really professional with me. I'm really feeling quite sponsz today There's nothing in here in my Specific formula was made just for me and all of my weird skin things that are wrong with my skin because there's a lot wrong with it with um I'm popular I fight cussed one more time. I'm going to get this brand deal taken away all you had to do is go to their website fill out a fun little skin quiz and upload some little selfies and They did the rest and then you're paired with your own special little dermatology provider Mine is named Emily Gruber Thank You. Emily for making my skin less Thank You Emily for making my skin Cuter, it's cuter now so grateful for you sis. Emily analyzed everything she analyzed my skin history my current regimen and Skin goals to give me exactly what I wanted in the product and I am just forever grateful for that Here's the front of the bottle. It's so beautiful and fun. Here's the back of the bottle It has the ingredients right here, which I do not know how to pronounce any of those but I'm gonna try regardless zinc Pyrithione, Clindamycin and Niacinamide. Oh, you know I think cyanide is a bad thing sinem I'd thank you better and then as you can see We have Miss Emily Gruber right here who helps me with everything and it's just my best friend Also, if you didn't believe that I use this project every day, look at all that residue if that's not proof Like I'm sorry, that's proof. Like you cannot call me a fake Also, let me show you the consistency because I think that's kind of fun feel like a beauty guru As you can see, it's just like that now for the most commercially part of this entire thing I'm gonna tell you how you can do your own specialty bottle of cure ology and be just like me It is so easy to just sign up using the link in my description Please use it and also because I'm nice and generous for you. You can get your first bottle free at curology and shipping is only $4.95 which is just an absolute. bargain sis. You got to take it. Come on Also, if you're worried, you know what I mean, you're like I don't know is Emma scamming me well, guess what It's no risk in commitment free sis. If I keep calling you sis now You're probably gonna unsubscribe your all you also offers a 90-day money-back guarantee so that if you hate it Which you won't but if you hate it You get your money back and you can spend that money on whatever you want like a new car Even though there's not gonna be enough there, but see yourself. I hope you enjoyed my first brand deal This will probably be also my last brand deal based on my performance here. I didn't do so well, but um, we'll see That's it Thanks"

I LUV U,
-emma chamberlain",2018-05-18T00:12:10Z,281065,7620121,24550,"Can you believe I literally printed out the fucking recipe [wow...edgy] Like we're in literally the middle ages using a printer anyways i dont even know what ow fuck! [then stop clapping omg] I drank so much coffee, I literally feel buzzed. Like I literally like-- is that-- I don't even know what being buzzed feels like. Cuz I'm like 12, so... Hey guys, what's up and welcome back to cooking with Emma! Editing Emma: *sighs* WHY are you acting like that? Also, I have leftover, like, acne spot treatment on my nose that I forgot to wash off this morning, [noice] so, um... I mean yeah, we're doing good. I haven't done one of these in a while because I kind of neglected it 'cause I was like, 'eh, it's a stupid concept.' mm :) But I thought I'd bring it back for a few reasons. Number one: my birthday is coming up. Yes yay my birthday It is May, my birthday month. So far this month, I have not celebrated myself once. If anything, I've actually abused myself. No, not really. Like I just-- *that one meme* they asked you how you are and you have to say you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into it because thEY WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND-- I thought that today make myself some little birthday cupcakes for my b-day! Editing Emma: I just realized that I never actually tell you when my birthday is and so I'd just like to announce here, formally that my birthday is on May 22nd! Just keep that in mind, when that day rolls around, wish me a happy birthday, make me feel special, um, send me money.. Send me that money, I might even start a GoFundMe called 'make Emma's birthday the best birthday ever' [actually tho] Donate all of your parents savings, all of their retirement funds and make me feel special, everybody! Thank you so much; May 22nd, a day for the books, a day to put down in your calendar, a day to never forget. It is the best day of the year, because it's the day all about me, and I am the only human being on this planet that actually matters so alright! :D Keep it in mind, baby Another reason why I thought we'd do a little cooking with Emma today is because you guys-- (editing emma:) I know it's disgusting that my cat is on the counter, but trust me. I wiped off the counter before I started cooking. Okay, trust me. I.. did that.. I did-- I did that. I'm just gonna-- *screeches from the fiery pits of hell* You guys have been sending me shit tons of stuff for cooking with Emma Let's do a little haul. Shall we? First we got an electric mixer. Which I am so excited about! I didn't even wash it just gonna use it, unwashed. So if I die, I don't care. yES If you guys are OG Cooking with Emma watchers, you know that I used to have to mix stuff, like, with a whisk so I would have to like take a whisk like this And like mix it really fast, and it was like not good mmnyuhhhh I'm literally so tired! My arm is burning! 30 more seconds! 10 9 8 7 6 MY ARM! Yeah, it wasn't good. Another thing- next thing- speaking of whisk, the next thing in our haul: this beautiful golden whisk like,, okay. Next someone got me a adorable aDORAble little oven mitt set, okay This is adorable! And the last things that you guys got me were some aprons. I don't even know which one I'm gonna wear today today. Do you know what? I'm gonna wear all of them. Okay, I'm glad we figured that out. It is so cute- Wait, why is it like that? Oh my God- Look how low it goes. Look how literal- like wait. Is that normal? Oh, no. Oh I see. Here's apron number one. This one's a little bit more.. stylish. Next one is this- oh, this is just amazing. Don't be afraid to take whisks! fucking funny. I'm literally gonna be wearing four.. what are these called again? Aprons! hah..I am an idiot. Have I been calling it robe? I don't know if I've been calling it aprons this whole time. We're gonna see about that. What just happened? Okay, next one. This one says: Danger - Emma's cooking. haha I'm offended. This one actually says the same thing as-- but don't be afraid to take whisks. So if you guys sent me something for Cooking with Emma, Thank you, and it's because of you that I'm back here doing another one Well, it's also because my birthday is coming and I deserve it. It's my birthday So naturally we're gonna be doing some sort of cake. Cake is good. But what's better than cake? Cupcakes. So today we're gonna be making cupcakes. I think the whole thing with like birthdays It's always so funny like when you're a kid and stuff. It's like on your birthday It's like I want my favorite type of cake and everyone has their favorite type of cake well I'm a little bit different with what my favorite cake is because no one else has the same favorite cake as me my favorite cake Was always lemon cake Yes, I had issues as a child If y'all are new Basically, what we do here is is that you watch me bake and then by the end of the video You're like I just wasted ten minutes of my life. You don't really benefit actually at all So you can click off now because I already got my ad money. So that's good. You already given me your gift to me So you can just click it off if you want All right for all my homies still here. Let's just hop right into it. I have this whisk I've used this before This isn't a new thing but still thought I would bring it out here because it is fucking awesome What if I just wrote it like like kind of like this reminds me like a witch Oh Like, you know like witches on their broom, but I'm like a cooking witch. Oh, that's so cool Now I'd really be on to something if my broom wasn't facing the wrong way Let's first talk about our lemon cake that we're gonna be making today it's vegan I choose to make vegan things because if I don't make it vegan Then I get roasted and I'm not in the mood for that because guess what it's my fucking birthday and I'll cry if I want To but I don't want to cry so don't find roast me in the comments. Oh my god I'm tired already like we haven't even started. I'm already tired and sick of it and like we're ready do you know what I have to do all of the dishes for this after this is over like I have to do all of The dishes and it makes a lot of dishes. I should probably set the oven. What's even the degrees 350 I don't care It actually took me a really long time to find a recipe for this type of Cupcake because surprisingly there isn't a lot of vegan lemon cake recipes after thinking about it for a while I realized it's because no one likes lemon cake After probably like 20 minutes of searching online I finally found this website and I knew that it was gonna be a winner by the headline I mean like it is good enough for him. It'll be good enough for me. You know what I'm saying? Fuck, going into this. I actually spent also more time trying to find this recipe because I really wanted it to go well
I actually went and I read some of the reviews of this lemon cupcake and I was so pleased to see that all the reviews Were really really positive. I thought we'd go through some of them today. Mm-hmm Anyways, these cupcakes are delicious. I made them for my daughter's birthday Dinner a couple of nights ago and they go such rave reviews that I made a double batch for a party. She's having tonight Well, number one. I'm glad that the cupcakes are delicious I am glad because that tells me all I need to know that tells me that it's a winner and that tells me that I should make them but where I got a little bit triggered about this was that like This mom is like being bragging about the fact that her daughter has like two birthday parties Like I'm not even gonna have one birthday party The daughter has a birthday dinner, and then she also has another party that she's going to tonight Okay, also, yes. I did print this shit out for two reasons. Number one actually only one reason I only printed it out for one reason It's because once my hands get dirty, I'm not gonna be able to touch my phone to look at this shit So I print it all out pretty genius if you ask me Colleen says these look crazy good I'm almost afraid to make them bitch. What's the worst that can happen? If you make them you'll eat them all in one sitting who cares. That's what menopause is for I'm just assuming that all of the people writing these reviews are moms. Sara says these look delightful I want to just bite right in that's gross whose mom's name is Sara I feel like Sara is like the name of like a 12 year old girl every single time I've never met somebody named Sara who was older than 12 I don't even like baking. I want a spoon feed that frosting into my mouth bitch Calm down, fuck I did not use a big enough ball for this Okay, no, it's good So how have you guys been? I mean, I just want to know like have you been like is your birthday coming up? Cool I really don't care Let's talk about my birthday. Oh my god wait, I just realized that I forgot to show something in my hall earlier So let's show that now a bunch of super mini whisks 20 of them You guys are amazing because that is so cute now back to work because that's just irrelevant Let's talk about birthdays personally. I think birthdays are fucking stupid also I don't like getting older I use some when I was little and I want Wanted to be older so bad and now I'm like older and I'm like, well, I'm still 12 but oh, yeah You guys don't even know how old I'm turning 12 last year I was also 12 but because I don't look any different it makes it so that I'm just still 12 now Do you want this I'm turning 17, which is funny cuz I don't look like it I want to be 16 forever being 16 is the funnest age and it took me the entire year to realize that too I was like being 16 sucks. And then now I'm like fuck being 16 was so fun You have freedom because you can get your license and you can drive around but then also Your parents still pay for everything's looking awesome. Let's use the electric mixer. It says mix it What the fuck? Yo big fat shout-out to the person who sent me this shit because this just changed my life, let me like it Okay weird, I don't even know what you're talking about I got distracted by my I'm worried about me. What else should we talk about running out of content? Um, let's talk about 17, 17 the age that no one cares about like what happens to you when you're 17 when you're 16 You get your driver's license and then when you're 18, you become an adult when you're 17. You're just a piece of shit But I think it would be a good year. So I'm gonna try to make it the best year of my life But I'm also getting really old and like I don't like being old I don't want to be old like what's gonna happen when I turn like 30. Oh my god, they get more wrinkles now Let's get Botox so it's like fine. But oh my god. Do you know what I Bitch I forgot to buy flour, I might have some oh my god. This might change everything guys I literally think I forgot. Okay get a fucking load of this. I have coconut flour. I have almond flour I have green banana flower. What the fuck is that and I have Tiger nuts flour, okay None of these are regular flour. What kind of household do I live in? Hi, do we have like regular flour? If not, don't even worry about it, but do we? She said No, so now it's the game. We're gonna play a game called what flour do we use? I'm just gonna eat eeny Meeny miny. Moe eeny. Meeny miny moe catch a tiger by you I don't know something on saying that out loud makes me really uncomfortable. So I'm just gonna be like this Almond flower, I purposely chose this one because it's the one that I feel like is the least likely to have error Okay Like my life was a mess before like it's one thing to like mess up a recipe and like have shitty Cupcakes on a normal day of the year, but like it's my birthday You know what I'm saying? I like went grocery shopping for this video and I like forgot the flour I Would use this shit all day if I could what's next what's next who knows these days I was kind of deep I'm kind of sad now. I'm kind of gonna get lazy now. I'm just lazy in lazytown. Oh my god, where's my coffee? Do I did I not I could've sworn I made myself a coffee earlier. Oh my god. Wait. Yeah, I already drank it What the fuck? Okay. I'm not like trying to paint it I the flower Huh? Did you guys just see that okay, it's okay you can't get Let's taste the batter I'm scared for my life It tastes so good like what it's perfect this is a fucking birthday miracle I can't get too excited though because it's all about what happens in the oven and that's when things are gonna get bad So I like clean this up. Let's talk about our feelings lately. I've been thinking about how I'm gonna die alone. I You know I've gone 17 years out of my life and I have been single the entire time. Is that gonna change anytime soon? Probably not what I mean. Hey, I haven't had to deal with getting hugs when I didn't want to have one a hug No one gives me hugs. So it's never like I don't wanna hug right now. You know, that's good. I Have like nine cupcake pans but I still thought it'd be a good idea to like order one on Amazon for this video and I didn't need it and my Mom got mad. I hope I have cupcake liners if I don't that's many bad, but it wouldn't be the first mistake We've made oh, yes, finally something goes good for me. I only have three little whiner. Um, So yeah, so no, we're doing good. Let's see. Do I have any more? Oh my god. Wait, do I have more come on? I might have more. Oh my god. I do have more that was actually a really good luck for me Like I'm actually like scared cuz I'm like too good lucks in a row. I Might die soon. Let's talk about birthdays in the past for me. I don't even really remember. I've never been somebody who likes birthdays I like going to others people's birthdays. Why because they had to stress out and they had to plan it not me I didn't have to sit around and plan it the moral of the story Here is you should try to get invited to other peoples parties So that by the time years comes around you have no desire to even throw a party I was also trying to think about what my favorite age so far has been like being alive wise but I think 16 like this Year was an amazing year probably one of the best years of my life But at the same time I wanted to die for half of it. I'm really scared the batter tastes good. It looks good It's just it all depends on what happens in the oven if the chemical reaction doesn't occur properly These cupcakes will end up being shit and honestly, even if these turn out fucked up At least I can eat the frosting and like cry myself to sleep. God. Did we figure that out together? Don't tell your mommy it smells like a barbecue outside cuz I have all my windows open cuz it's nice and warm out So yeah, it's most like a barbecue. How are you feeling about that people? Also, I got a little bit of batter on this string which it's just definitely that's not supposed to happen because you can't wash that Okay, let's taste it This is so good bitch Bitch bitch I literally don't even care how the cupcakes turn out anymore this frosting is so good. Whatever. I don't care This is my birthday miracle. I'll see you when the cake is done. Okay when the cupcakes are done? Yay Yay first impression it's intact, which is promising. I see we add some food coloring to this how Can you shut up? No? You fucking what the oh, I'm just gonna leave it. Wow. This actually feels cool a little tie-dye actionable tie-dye. Bday action I've been filming for like three hours and I'm just done. Oh my big bday cupcake. Oh, What the fuck"

-emma chamberlain",2018-05-11T00:53:59Z,153589,3407070,7202,"It's kinda hot in my car oooh a Hi What's up, guys? -Jesus Christ- Do You See What I See? That's fuckin gross. -whispers- if you can't tell what it is. it's a hair I'm sick. I'm not feeling so good. Okay, but guess what the YouTube GRIND doesn't stop. all right? I already was kind of slacking this month, and I'm sOrRy, but we're back. We're fuckin back But I'm sick and so I don't want to do any.. Creative ideas because of that we're gonna be doing what I like to call EAzY content So we're just gonna be driving around today and just talking about what feels right Of course, if we're gonna be doing a little driving video, we need to have a little activity, you know what I mean? We can't just drive around aimlessly. That's f***ing stupid. Today. We're going and getting druMROLL PLEASE . .. . Philz! (kids cheer) we're getting Philz I haven't gotten Philz in a video in a while.. So I don't even know if you guys all know what it is, but it's a coffee place and it's SO GOOD I used to go there like every single day, but then I stopped because I--I- I got.. oof I can't talk I'm like struggling cuz like my tongue is all swollen from being sick anyway, I'm actually kinda concerned for myself because I don't think you get a swollen tongue from having a little cold I think it's something worse Something like chlamydia who is screaming outside of my apartment right now?! I'm going to literally go out and whoop some ass Do you hear that? I NEED to move.. I got an espresso machine :))) And so now I'm like well--- f*** I can't just like go spend all my money at Philz (well, yea I can) because I have an espresso machine like I have to start prioritizing What means most to me, you know what I'm saying, also I wanted to try out Philz new app. This is not f***in sPoNsORED I wish it was, like literally it- Oh, i WiSh iT WaS Philz please like pay me a lot of money. Slide through with that coin. You feel me? I I regret saying that Philz has this new app where basically you can order Phil's through your phone I love how I'm talking about this app like it's some sort of like Technological advancement that hasn't existed for like 20 years on like other apps for other... Establishments like Starbucks has been doing this for years. Okay, but I'm a f***ing grandma and I don't go to Starbucks so I don't care Fuck you guys, fuck you. Oh my GOD you're an idiot You're so fucking stupid. we're at a stop sign with how hard is it to figure that out? Disgusting bitch anyways, haha. You can order your coffee and then ten minutes later, It'll be ready. So that's what I'm doing today I really wanted to try that because that means less human contact also cuz I'm sick and the last thing I want to deal with... ...is people being like ""oh my god your voice sounds so bad are you sick?"" like shut the fuck up Anyways, I've sent a few things that have been kinda on my mind lately, and I thought you know It wouldn't hurt to just kind of rant about 'em. Right? Right! last night I was laying in my bed and I was like looking through my own videos Which I never do by the time I upload it. I'm like sick of it I'm like, I never want to see this hoe again Right. Also, I'm like squinting because they don't have sunglasses or maybe I do nope I don't. Okay Well, you're just gonna have to watch me squint then. I look constipated So I was watching old videos from like four or five months ago and holy fuck that shit is so cringe Oh my god, you would think that like not much would change in like four or five months? No, I was literally like watching a cardboard box fucking talk We don't talk about that anymore cuz that's just too sad almost but I'm glad though cuz I guess it's good and bad It's like that means I'm growing, you know I'm evolving so I need to like order my coffee right now like as I'm driving Right and the coffee takes ten minutes to like be created I don't wanna like order in the parking lot cuz then I'll be waiting but I also can't order it while I'm driving cuz I Cuz I'll fucking crash the car and die also I decided I'm gonna not bleep out my f-bombs anymore So do not watch my videos around your mom. Well, actually I take that back I'm gonna bleep out some of them sometimes I'm just gonna bleep out them when I feel like it like if I'm like Oh, well, I kind of need that f-bomb right there, then I'll leave it But if it's like an unnecessary f-bomb, I'll bleep it out. If it's one that really didn't need to be there Just kind of like a filler. I really Need to work on my vocabulary Okay, oh my god we have a red light right now I'm gonna see if I can order this okay I might be able to do this... fuck. I just did the first step. I just typed it all in So now all I have to do is press pay But I don't want to do that while I'm driving because as I said before I want to preserve my life You know what? I mean? Like I'm Feel like I could live a pretty long life As long as I just like kind of keep things under wraps, you know large creamy almond milk no sugar iced. Perfect funny story about this app earlier I decided that I would like place the order because I like assumed that they would let you choose your pickup time right I was Like well if I order it now, they'll be ok if I want to pick it up in like an hour So I was gonna do that right you're ahhh fuck you. Sorry, I just cut a bunch of people off. Haha Don't even care Yolo bitches. I placed the order They never said anything about time and like pickup time before I place the order after a place order It showed on the top of the app. It was like pickup in 10 minutes. I'm like bitch immediately. I'm like panicking I'm like, I can't be there in 10 minutes and then below it There's a little thing that says made a mistake on your order? cancel right now. You have 30 seconds, and I'm like faaaAAAA Like quickly like I'm canceling it. This guy's staring at me. Imagine being me Imagine literally giving a thumbs up to someone staring at you in traffic like who the fuck does that? Actually, I'll just act like I'm talking on the phone So yeah So basically, she said that in and then because her yesterday and I don't know I'm just feeling like really because I'm just feeling really kind of confused about it business-wise, you know And I don't know. I'm just kind of lately Well, I mean yesterday she told me but it was kind of like and you know what I mean Because she didn't tell me all of it. She just kind of told me some of it and so ok I have to put you down Sorry, that was the most uncomfortable thing. That's ever happened to me That guy was dead ass staring at me and I'm like, what the fuck am I supposed to do? I can't talk to my camera right now. If you're looking at me like that, I don't even care I feel like even Casey Neistat would be uncomfortable in that situation and that man vlogs anywhere! Fuck youuu OH...You're old though. So it's fine. Meh can't be mad. I can't be mad It's like illegal to be mad at an old person while driving. Did that guy just flip me off? I'm like, you literally cut ME off bitch. You can't flip me off now That's not how the rolls can't it's not how it you know what I mean? Don't want to hit a pedestrian and then go to jail, you know, ah, there's...oh fuck. Ooooh aaack I'm gonna go why am I now in a driveway? How did this happen? And how am I here? It's time to pick up my Philz. Let's see as you can tell I'm ecstatic I also just rewatched some of my footage and I was filming like the lower half of my body Primarily and I just want to apologize for that because no one wants to see that Yeah, that's what you're gonna get but it's not what I know you want. You know what I'm saying? Yaaay. I've officially decided that this whole order for pickup thing is just genius. I literally walked in there It was already made for me. It was perfect. It was an amazing encounter. I am so blessed for it Why is my blinker on? Okay Tastes great. The funny thing about coffee is that it's not actually that good like it kind of tastes bad But you're more just like anticipating the results. I don't know what I was talking about here like coffee Tastes amazing. You know that if you drink a coffee, you're gonna shit later and that's like great You know what? I mean? You also know that you're gonna have energy so you're like excited about it So it's almost like you like the flavor because you know, it's gonna have good results for you I don't know. Think about that next time Let's talk about what I've been thinking about lately number one Kanye West's Twitter. The thing about it is that I actually don't care about it AT ALL I could not give less fucks about something. I wanted to tell a little story I like made the conscious decision to like not follow Kanye just because I don't care about what he has to say. Also because... ...Everybody is talking about it enough... ...So like I just felt like they can tell me if anything crazy happens and I'll just unfollow him. So I've literally seen maybe three of his tweets, right? I don't even know what everyone's like ranting about like I don't even know why everyone's so angry at him I
don't know because I don't really want to look it just kind of feels good to me to not have that burden and I'm like proud of me! I feel like I'm rebelling against society for not knowing anything about his tweets and not reading them! But all of this was happening, right? I was like consciously rebelling I was like I don't want to read these I don't really care Occasionally one of his tweets would show up in my timeline because somebody would like like it or retweet it or whatever usually it was just stupid inspirational quotes and that was the end of that but One day one of his tweets shows up in my timeline and I was like, how is this in here? I looked at the top nobody had retweeted it, nobody had liked it I'm like what the fuck happened what happened? Next is frightening. I look at his account. I click on it right and I see that I'm following him and I was like No, I'm not what the fuck meaning that something happened that made me follow him and I have a conspiracy to the fUCKING government It's paying on Kanye to put ideas into our brains and the government wants us to read his tweets So if we don't follow him the government follows him for us Oh fuck Oh... Kind of zoned out there for a second, you know, what I should do right now I'm gonna react to a few of his tweets cuz I haven't like seen any of them This isn't bad. Like this is nice. Like I agree. Like I need this advice sometimes like sometimes I do need a walk outside Okay, I mean like, this is like a literal like 2012 Pinterest quote. Like that's it. Okay I'm not gonna read anymore cuz they really don't give a fuck speaking of Twitter I am still not verified on ANY social media platforms! Ohhh you poor thing! and a lot of you guys are like Emma, why the fuck aren't you verified? Like asking me as if I know the reason. I have NO clue. The only real benefit for it Is that just looks cool It doesn't really have any kind of like visible benefits Like it doesn't benefit me in life except for like maybe boost my ego for like five minutes and then I'll go back to self-loathing You know what else I've been thinking about I'm a little bit punchy right now Like I'm a little bit violent like I feel like I'm a little bit aggressive. That's the word! You know what, I'm not gonna like hide it, like I'm gonna show this to you I'm gonna like let you live this life with me, okay? anyway It's time to go. I need to leave. I think I need to drive away I'm being very aggressive and this whole entire video is just so fucking weird Like, what even happened? I want you to leave here feeling like you have something tangible that you can like use To apologize to you and to make you feel like you got something of value Out of this video and not just watching me be aggressive for 20 minutes I think we should do a little playlist video Segment because I need to listen to some music because I'm just kind of like triggered right now Why am I triggered? like nothing fucking happened? That's like that Shows you I've been on Twitter too much. FUCK, I just drove by a cop! I drove through a yellow light It turned red in the middle of the intersection or whatever and I know that's not illegal I don't think but there's a cop right there and I'm like fuck. I'm also jamming out This might be the end of my driving career, I might get my license taken away right now! Not even because I broke a rule just because I deserve it. I don't even deserve to have my license I'm way too rowdy for this shit. Anyways back to jamming out. Ahhh is this illegal? I don't know. Well, I did it so... This next song, it fucking bops! it's by ""Declan McKenna"" Declan if you're watching this, let's go on a date! Just kidding... *Notices someone staring at here and laughing* fuuuUUU Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. FUCK. Um no, this is so bad, oh my god this is so bad Oh my god AH I need oh my god, I'm in so much pain I'm literally in pain because I saw someone laughing at me like they know, like they know what's happening Ok like I'm so embarr- do you what? I don't care. No, I do care like that was so embarrassing! I always regret it! Like I feel like I'm in my own world I feel like no one can see me, but like no like everyone can see me! and like that's the thing I'm filming DAD! Hi everyone So yeah My camera just turned off and I was just talking to the camera with like no one actually like with the camera being off for about 20 minutes so like I mean, yeah, like we're doing good. I'm not even filming right now. Like I don't even know Yeah, I am. That's a first. This is about to get sooo aggressive because I'm angry now Okay? let's go back to what we were gonna do Yeah everybody already knows that shit, I'm not gonna play anymore. Okay moving on So um, Before I play this song I just like to kind of run it all by you and make sure you guys are all aware that I did in fact hear this song live while I was at Coachella, yeah I'm just want to like make sure you guys were all aware that I was in fact AT Coachella And while I was there, I actually did hear the song live So I just wouldn't want to run that all by you guys All right Make sure you guys all knew and we're all completely aware of the fact that I was at Coachella and heard this song live So I was at Coachella and I heard it live and it was amazing Seriously the best time of the year, I mean wow It was just unreal and actually while it was, wait funny story while I was at Coachella I actually got to hear this song live fucking unreal. So yeah. Alright, let's get right into it Not to mention that I did actually hear this song live at Coachella How did that happen?? This song makes me like really emo so I'm not going to play a lot of it cuz like I don't want to get emo right now like i'm already aggressive like now I don't want to be sad AND aggressive like that's a bad, dangerous combo. Doesn't it sound like it'd be from like the Lord of the Rings soundtrack. I don't know, like it's good! So that song slaps. I hope the cameras still on like at this point like the god only knows Jesus Christ it is still on and I'm proud of me because guess what? I didn't think it was gonna be. I didn't think it was and it is. The thing is like once I start a playlist Segment like it's it cannot be short and then it's like next thing I know I've been filming for like nine hours. This video could've been over right now Like this video could have been over a minutes ago, but you know what? we're still going because I decided that I would show you every song I've ever liked in my entire life! What the FUCK!? Wait, what the fuck is going on here? oh my god, I'm watching like a dad like film his child like, with, I don't, nevermind... And I'm gonna cut someone off you feel me? like especially this Tesla right now like you know You can't cut off Tesla's like they will ruin your life, so I just have to be considerate of that. Okay? Thank you God. Ok do you know what? That's it for today's video, I am done. OK? I'm done. I think that like that song makes me less like feel less aggressive like my aggressiveness is like lowered about 4% like I'm still very aggressive. But yeah, thank you for watching this. I love you so much, you're amazing and you're important to me and you're my best friend Stay cool and I'll see you in the next one. Peace out."

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-05-05T03:16:52Z,146862,3897958,9924,"God Jesus there's no way to make this lighting not look bad. No. I'm gonna, like... it's gonna be this way So what's up? another travel vlog? We're really on that grind Guess who pulled another all all-nighter? Guess who pulled another -- fucking... pff guess who pulled another all-nighter?? Me, because guess who didn't plan her time right and then had to edit all night? Me, okay? *aggressive burp* Sorry like I don't... Last night, I pulled another all-nighter because I had to wake up at 5:00 a.m. It's literally like deja vu from my last vlog which was my Coachella vlog except for that I'm not going to Coachella because I already went to Coachella and that is over. Thank God I am going to Orlando, Florida for Playlist Live. Yay I am so flippin excited I've never been to anything like this ever in my life. I'm doing a meet-up on Saturday, and then a panel on Sunday I'm pretty sure my meetup is with Elle Mills and Weston and Kalynn those are like my favorite people of all time think it's gonna Be a great time, but it's 5:30 a.m.. Right now the flight to Orlando Florida is like Six hours, I'm not too pumped about that, but I downloaded some movies on my mom's iPad. I sound like a fucking toddler I downloaded some movies on my mom's iPad. I'm just drinking a coffee and Letting it all hang loose, ew. also, if you don't know what playlist is cuz I don't know maybe people don't know I always assume people don't know things I just Assume you're an idiot even though you're not you're fucking smart, and you're beautiful You're welcome, but anyways I think it's like I don't even know what you'd even call it it's just kind of like a cool thing I actually, don't know what it is I literally don't know how to describe it. You're just gonna have to see I guess hey friends. How are you? I want to go in like do a meet and greet with Weston. oh my god I'm turning it off Hey guys in the airport right now sitting in a chair doing awesome Just spent 80 dollars on a fucking portable charger because they're so expensive Let me do a little portable charger haul not sponsored. Wish it was though I'm poor, but I'm too scared to do sponsorships because I don't want to look like a sellout I have this little cool one okay? I like about it. Is that look at this look at this little gadget right here  and you're like Me see, I'm saying some good shit right there. I'm really hungry. I don't know what I want to eat I've eaten Mexican food two days in a row and there's Mexican food right there, but I'm just like do I really want to have Mexican food a third day in a row like I think the answer might have to be yes And I'm kind of scared of it. Also look at this see right here This is because I put on fake tan over a scab because I literally had chafing from my backpack at Coachella For my backpack I could Coachella   Yes, I was chafing and it's embarrassing, but I chafed at Coachella, so I was like whatever I can't wait to watch movies on this on this bad boy later downloaded some movies on this hoe It's not even my iPad, but hahaha my mom's I'll have one of my own one day Why are you staring at me bitch, also mommy do you wanna yes? I still call my mom mommy like don't comment down below about it I don't freaking care if you don't call your mom mommy. You don't even have a heart or you're just like a little bit more mature than me I'm at my hotel room. I don't really know what to do with myself because it's Thursday and like nothing really starts happening until Tomorrow yeah tomorrow, so it's kinda like eh I don't know what to do it myself Hi, I took a few hour nap and it felt so good tomorrow morning, I'm doing a Shoot for lucid magazine and so that will be really cool. Also look at this like sunset behind me You can literally see Universal Studio or Universal something. I don't know what it's called and Disney World from my freaking room. It's awesome I'm just gonna lay here in my own drool and tears no just Um well I'm gonna shower and then hit the haystack. You know what i'm saying? so... Guess I'll see you tomorrow Good morning! (I am so sorry about my behavior.) how did i do? Okay as I said last night? I have a little photo shoot today So I thought I would do my makeup with you guys cuz I don't really do my makeup ever so this is gonna be fun And interesting I'm starting out with the glossier invisible shield daily sunscreen moisturizer primer thing I just recently made an order from the makeup brand glossier. It is so amazing. I am gonna be showing some of their products today. I'm such a beauty guru, so yeah I love it. (I wanna die.) Don't know if I should also use moisturizer with it like should I moisturize with it Maybe I should I don't know what I'm doing see that's the thing maybe I should moisturize like in the dry areas See this is me like doing science instead also. Oh my god quick moment I'm wearing my shirt my report of the week merch. He is my favorite youtuber I'll link his channel down below because I just love him so much and he makes me feel calm when I'm anxious and I just Love him, so now. We're putting on some concealer I have the NARS creamy concealer because I decided to splurge a little bit But I don't even know if it's my color so like that's cool I also don't know what I'm doing most people are always like don't leave makeup corrections down below. i already know what i'm doing. But I am on other hand not like that if you see something that I'm doing that is wrong Please tell me because I want to get better. I'm not afraid of some Criticism and I know that the Internet, it's usually not constructive. It's usually always Just negative criticism, so I'm willing to take both positive is preferred, but we'll work with what we have. i know I wasn't patting on my forehead. I was kind of rubbing and I'm probably gonna get roasted for that Know what I'm doing like I watched James Charles sometimes like it's not like I'm just sitting here. You know being stupid yeah You're on your period yeah, no wonder you're a bitch I was supposed to have my period right now, but it just never came so I'm probably pregnant We're gonna be using the laura mercier Even are so proud of me right now cuz I like really stepped up my makeup game now I went to Sephora the other day and bought a shit ton of stuff that I didn't need I'm gonna be baking today now this Is what I'm gonna Fuck up first. I put it underneath my eyes. Okay, great. Just killed that I don't know if that's correct like I don't know if I did too much if I did you little like I don't really know But I really don't care because this is what I did at Coachella, and it works. Oh Oh, my god. Wait when do I do my eyebrows? I want point I never used to do my eyebrows, but now I bought this glossier product And now I'm like well you best believe I'm gonna be doing my eyebrows I think their headquarters is also in San Francisco. Not sure about that actually I Don't think it is so that was a lot. I don't care yeah I just googled it and their headquarters is in New York, so I don't know where I got the idea. It's in San Francisco I guess I'm just an idiot so for all the men watching this who think I look like an idiot There's no men watching this actually so I don't know why I even said that boys hate me My doors are always open though, and I'm willing to take Suggestions, so this is the brow product It's called the glossy a boy brow, which is just ironic because I look like a boy at all times, so Looks so good. It looks so good. I'm not even she looks good, and I don't care what you saying look I literally don't care what you have to say about it like she looks good. Do you ever get an eyebrow brush? No, okay. I'm just gonna die now And it actually works kind of good, so that's really weird and upsetting about whatever fuck I wish I had an eyebrow brush damn it. That's so helpful How do I let me know how my toothbrush, but it's just not the same actually it kind of is the same That's the thing that's upsetting about it. Anyway. Okay? I think it's time to brush off my baking now probably too early for that, but I'm sick of having it on here, and then the mascara I use is the Too Faced better than sex mascara and waterproof because I cry a lot So at least I already brushed my teeth which is the most tiring part of the day? I hate brushing my teeth if it was up to me. I'd never brush them again, and you might be like Emma That's disgusting, but I have a reasoning here. Also. This angle is just so bad. I'm sorry about that That's just like the worst angle of all time I don't like brushing my teeth because even if it's a waste of my time it takes forever And it's just uncomfortable. This is fine like we're doing okay on this side, but this eye is just fucked up I used to use eyelash curlers, and they would help so much But then one day I was using it and then when I took it off it had ripped out a bunch of my eyelashes without my consent and Yes, I am a beauty guru now, it's not a big deal. You don't need to freak out about it This is the makeup of the day am I proud of it Do I just hit the hay no, I'm not kidding this is BAE. She's dope okay. Just look at that smile. She's so sweet Yes of course I was jealous that he would kiss Megan like that, but also I was terrified for my life I'm sorry Cailin, but you're using too much tongue, buddy hey everyone guess what? i can make 250 yo mama jokes and not even breathe between them My wants to follow you for some inexplicable is there you go The coordinate is it's so sick I would say the same joke no fucking awesome. I like it it Just makes me kind of uncomfortable like just a little bit. Oh, I don't I actually can't do Yeah, so good morning guys woke up to a little hip hop moment feeling real good about it Went to bed at 3 a.m. Like a freakin savage didn't listen to my freaking mom either told her I don't care, and then I went to bed No, I like for then woke up this morning. Took a nice shower. You don't care about my life back of the hip Oh, I'm not like an hour worth of footage of this. Yeah, it's like in half It's blurry - I don't want to watch this at all anymore. Can we? Can we please leave I think it's I am so happy. I have a bagel now feeling very good about this. How are you? Just we just finished our Meetup. It was like 9 hours I wasn't made my body is like adding on like healthy. I'm not okay Kaylynn, I'm sorry for ignoring you I'll do better next time welcome to the family vlog. We just got a new dog. our house got broken into. weston's pregnant. One big happy family someone just gave birth. AWWWWWW. a c-section. YEAAAAAAH. For some context we found this gummy bear on the ground, and we said whoever would eat It could get 20 whopping dollars to spend on whatever you freakin want if you want to buy whatever You can use that money. I give you this $20 bill. You'll eat that Okay, but now this is when things get extra freaky So I moved the camera right when he ate it and didn't even catch him eating it on camera Yeah, I don't know I'm flawed. It's fine Just have nothing today Sorry I'm gonna watch this footage back me what the fuck was I just doing what the fuck was I just doing today I have A panel which I don't even know what that means I guess I'm gonna talk about some stuff on a stage I love my bae I like her because she refills the snacks, so I'm like you know I'm looking around and I look for here And I see baked chips and it reminds me how fucking annoying baked chips are literally the stupidest shit. I've ever seen in my life if you like baked chips stub your toe I don't care Hi we're at a fucking bowling I don't know why we're here It's hard to tell what's going on here? So I'll tell you basically he threw the bowling ball before the bowling pins were put down and so then obviously he hit the little Thing that comes down and it the ball came back to him, haha funny What's up guys I'm home I'm an absolute mess. Do you know what let's just put the hood on I don't even care anymore, okay good I feel better this way. I thought that I would give a little playlist recap because i didn't really vlog a lot I kind of was a shitty *burp* Why did my burp literally taste like gasoline like I'm afraid I'm dying I'm decomposing I didn't really vlog a lot cuz I'm like so lazy and no it's not even I'm lazy It's just that like all the good stuff happens when your camera's in your bag some stuff. You can't even vlog because it's like illegal So anyways, playlist live is cool it it was fun. It was awesome to meet you guys if I met you this weekend Thanks for saying. Hi. I love you so much, and we had a lot of fun. You don't care about this stupid shit Let's talk about the stories So I only really have one story time and it's just kind of a series of unfortunate events let me take a little sip of Coffee before this one cuz it gets me a little triggered Okay, so basically if you're like a creator you have to have like certain credentials to like get around obviously for like safety reasons So that like a murderer doesn't like come in and like kill David Dobrik. You know what I'm saying We have like a special badge. We have like a special wristband like a lot of our special shit You know what I mean. I was walking around with my friends. Yes. I have friends They're actually not my friends I just like was like following people around and was like hopefully you don't mind that I'm following you and we were in the Creator' area of the hotel I turn around and I see this girl walking around with us She was like wearing no clothes like she was just wearing like a bathing suit and like shorts like no shoes nothing What's going on? And I was like I have no clue who this girl is And I wasn't sure I was like does anyone know she is I looked at her badge, and I was like that is not Right looks a little off. It looked like it was from like 2009 She ends up talking to me And she's like this is like my friends badge like it's not mine like I don't even know am I gonna be okay I'm like oh shit. I'm like. Oh fuck. I'm like yeah, you'll be alright. We end up walking around We go to few people's rooms. We're just chillin. She's kind of just like lingering around. I was like alright I got to like talk to her. You know like make sure she's alright I think everybody assumed that someone else knew her right it was like oh, no. She's probably their friend. Oh no She's probably their friend but like none of us actually knew her so finally we were gonna go to the like Creator party which is like actually really boring so anyway. We're getting into this party We were with like 20 people right and I let everyone go in front of me cuz I'm a polite ass bitch this girl is in front of me the girl that had been following us around all night that I did not know she shows her badge and the Guy immediate is like that's not real, and he's like where'd you even get this and she's just like lying? And he's like yeah, you need to go before we kick you out, and I was like oh fuck like hey I don't know what to do about this, but it's not my business because I'm normal okay. I'm just chilling here I don't know this girl like she just showed up. This is none of my business I hope she gets back to the hotel safe. I don't know what to do. I meet up with my friends We're like walking into the party and she like literally goes like no take me back to the hotel and I'm like Bitch I do not know you for a little bit more context So you can understand why this whole thing triggered me so much because I feel like I'm definitely a little bit traumatic Basically getting back to the hotel from the creator party means taking a golf cart all the way across the hotel grounds It's not like easy. It's not like a little two-minute walk like you have to hop on a fucking golf cart It's a hassle the fact that I was gonna have to do that for her was not okay with me, okay I was really triggered. Also if you didn't tell I am so sick like literally. I don't know what happened at playlist I don't know if it was the fact that I was hitting everyone's juul. I just am so sick So I don't know pray for me if you're watching this This is why this video took so long to get up because I'm fucking sick as fuck Okay, sick, bitch And then the security guard was like letting everyone in it's like are you associated with her? And I was like no she was like if you take her back to the hotel And if you're associated with her we're going to have to take away your credentials. I'm like what are you fucking talking about? I'm like I don't even know this girl. You're gonna like tie her to me? I'm like, oh hell no at this point I'm fucking fuming I'm like this girl follows us around and then like Selfishly like brings me into her own situation and like makes me take her back to her hotel room She could very easily have gone back by herself. It's safe. We're at playlist live We're not at fucking like I don't know the state pen like we're like it's safe here But she dragged me into this situation and made me go back with her I would never do that to somebody she like faked her way in and then forced me to like pay the price when she gets Kicked out I was fucking pissed so I take her back. I drop her off She wants me to like walk her to the front door. I'm like girl at this point It's been almost like 30 minutes because this whole situation that just caused a huge issue. Okay. I'm like good luck I'm so sorry that this happened to you. Please like stay safe. She's a human being uh yes I am triggered about this situation Yes, she was being selfish by dragging me into this shit But she's also a human being and I understand that then if she's somehow watching this which she probably isn't I'm sorry that you triggered Me, but you did so finally I get back to the party. I'm like Jesus Christ I hope I get good karma for this shit I'm like pissed like I can't even have a good time like we're trying to dance around. I'm like Cardi B. Comes on I'm like I want to go off right now But like I can't I'm triggered you know what I mean like she pissed me off all of a sudden I like reach into my pocket, and I pull my hand out and there's just like oily like liquid all over my hand I'm like what the fuck is this My chapstick exploded in my pocket, and it wasn't like a chapstick like the stick kind. It was like the liquid kind I will show you like you see how when it comes out. It's like liquid It was like that but even more liquidy It was actually the Kiehl's kind of chapstick - great chapstick But it is so liquidy And it is so oily and it just spilled all inside of my pocket not to mention I had bought that chapstick in the airport on the way to this trip, and it was ten dollars I was hoping that that would last me at least six months, but no it exploded all in my pocket And it was gone when I talk about chapstick I have to put it on it's like a weird thing so I go into the bathroom I'm fucking cleaning the chapstick out of my pocket, and I'm just like oh Okay, I'm fine. I'm totally fine. No like I'm good. I'm good at this point. I'm good I'm chapstick everywhere it also made like a little oil stain through my fucking pants So it look like I literally jizzed myself it looked like I had a fucking penis and that was upsetting, but I'm like okay We're just gonna keep going. I mean playlist live let's have a good last time Let's get crazy, and so at one point Weston is like complaining about his phone being dead, so I'm like hey What don't you don't worry about it use my portable charger You're chilling buddies mind you I had also bought this portable charger like three days before it was $80 It was an investment so of course I'm a little bit hesitant to give it out to just anybody, but I was like whatever. I'll give it to him I'll let him use it so letting him use it and like an hour goes by and I'm like did he Fucking lose it finally like the time came up. Where was appropriate cuz my phone died I'm like Weston Do you have my charger like my phone's dead? He's like we have some bad news the fucking kid broke my goddamn charger So used to have a cord right that comes out and you can like plug it in right here The fucking part that goes into the iPhone just falls off and That was the end of that that was it that was playlist this year. I hope it was fun. Hope is crazy finally I'm like done traveling so like my videos are gonna be normal again And I'm gonna be able to upload more and stuff like that maybe out I'm not gonna promise that though actually I'm not gonna promise that Cheers, and I'll see you next time go follow emma lmao:)  "

Yeah Sorry. Today's another travel vlog. I know you guys probably like Emma stop with the travel vlogs We're done, but um April's a busy month, so buckle your seat belt and come along for the ride if you want Today we're going to Palm Springs, Palm Desert, Coachella Valley for Coachella Music Festival I'm so fucking excited. I'm definitely tired though. I just pulled an all-nighter and you're probably Emma. Why did you pull an all-nighter? Here's my answer. I was editing a video, and I thought that I'd be done by around 1 a.m. And then next thing you know it's 5 a.m..

All right for starters we have bandana, which is from the bandana store actually I don't know where I got that so I don't know maybe Amazon or something glasses are from Amazon my top is from zafo It's actually bathing suit top because we're crazy like that my shorts Are Levi's my little fucking chain head ass thing is from brandy melville socks are from Topshop and shoes are converse so Mozilla Haven't vlogged at all today, and I just want to let you know that I'm sorry But I hope that you forgive me we're gonna gain some coffee right now. This is my second copy of the day Okay, like are we surprised we're back for a second one Guys I just thought I've lost my goddamn camera. He was on the ground. I'm in idiot. Okay. Sorry bye um hello I swear to fucking god. This bitch is on crack. She's on crack. I'm freaking out geometers You're off the camera cuz I'm being annoying as fuck right now. Okay. Bye okay? Well, she may be on crack, but at least she's self-aware Hi, it's day three let's talk, it's been a minute, okay I just wanted to fill you guys in because it's kind of been a hot minute It's so scary to bring out my camera because every time I bring out my camera I almost lose it and so I'm just like scared that I'm gonna like lose my camera Okay, sorry my body has been in like excruciating pain the whole time my upper back my feet have blisters all over them my voice Hurts I have dust all up inside my nose. I am a mess last night. I saw Timothy Shalem egg. Just chilling I was like you are so hot then I saw Jim Charles like twice since I hide of them those I'm scared I always thought Justin Bieber. It wasn't him okay. That was fucked up. Yeah, that was we were freaking it yeah, it was just a fat dude with a band and I Think we saw, Olivia O'Brien you saw her what? It's actually not as crazy as I thought it was gonna be but it's just like you're constantly walking around and your body hurts And you're just like what's going on look and you're dehydrated when there's lines for everything Alrighty get into the crowd you. They really can't and your edible all the time. I've been here. There was entire also I kept thinking that somebody was gonna Somehow like open my backpack while I was standing there and take my camera out so super paranoid about that doesn't mean it All right, so I didn't really get a good full photo of this outfit So this is gonna be a little bit of a struggle, but we're gonna do it Anyways, all right my glasses are from Francesca's again My little top thing basically naked top is from forever 21 My jewelry is from forever 21 And then this little necklace right here may or may not be something that I designed and will be selling down the line Maybe will but maybe it won't my skirt is from PacSun and my shoes are Nike Air Force Ones From Nike obviously so there it is stay three outfit. That was it Literally here again like this is the only place you see us like we are not anywhere else. We're getting coffee at all times it's just how it is really happy sometimes I Finished it in two minutes Bye At this point Coachella became living hell, okay, I didn't want to be here anymore But I still had to be there for another I don't know hour-and-a-half. It was not good I have never been more tired in my life That's kind of good Hello and welcome to Emma's Coachella review you might be like Emma Let's just like end the vlog right no one gives a fuck well I thought it would be kind of valuable if I gave you guys a little Coachella review because everybody's always talking about how amazing it Is now perfect it is and how flawless it is and how perfect it is And how it's the best time of the year, and how it's so fun and there's no flaws and it's totally worth the Thousands of dollars that you invest into it the funny part about it is it's not even actually Investing because you don't ever actually make any money back It just sucks money from your wallet, and then you never actually make it back it Just goes into nothing because you don't it's just that's the thing about it Also, look at this weird piece of lint in my hair It makes me really uncomfortable, and I like can't get my eyes off of it and like editing right now He's really difficult because they keep staring at the stupid piece of lint anyway, okay, well today I'm here to tell you the truth I think everybody wants Coachella to be as amazing as it looks because like they just want to believe it You know and I wanted to believe it. That's for damn sure and was I let down No, it was still a really cool experience But it's definitely not what I expected it to be so I thought I would kind of take you through the pros and the cons so first we're gonna start out with the cons because there's more of them I think that part of it is because my expectations were so high that like a lot of things stuck out to me as being Like kind of shitty the first con is that your body is gonna be hurting at all times my feet were hurting From standing on them all day my back was hurting from like standing up all day and jumping around and shit my lips were Constantly chapped like it did not matter how much chapstick i put on they were just getting dried out drying out dried out my nose Was all dry and had like dust and crusted in it because there's like dust flying around cuz you're in the desert Yeah, I had blisters all over my feet I don't know why I was like chafing like my backpack strings were like chafing my like arms like it was bad I'm also sensitive. That was probably part of it I'm a pussy moving on it's not all about the music a lot of people. I know even me I was like oh, I'm going for the music dude like what the fuck like I don't care about anything else I just want to hear the artists. I love ya know. No it's not like that okay I was like so disappointed because there was a lot of artists I wanted to see that I just couldn't end up seeing because like sometimes - two of your favorite artists will like be playing at the same Time and you have to like choose You know you and your friend might not agree so then it's like I don't want to see them, and it's like well I want to see them and they're like ""go hang go by yourself"", and you're like well I don't want to die, but also a lot of the times You'll show up and you'll be so excited, and then they'll be like a technical difficulty for example I went and I saw Rex Orange County. He was a special guest I was so excited He's one of my favorite artists like ever and like his microphone kept like fucking up like it like stopped working completely at one point And he like you couldn't even hear him also like his microphone kept making like weird loud squeaky sounds was all fucked up I'm like what the hell you're going just for the music I would say don't go because it's so much money And you're probably not even gonna see everybody you want and like it's probably not even gonna sound as good as it would if you Just like went to their concert like Separately another con is that it's a fuckin mess. It's a big mess There's creepy men Everywhere people just like grabbing your arm and like kissing your hand and following you around and shit like I'm ugly and they still were Doing that and that says something drunk people everywhere like people throwing up It's a mess okay moving on there's just no reception so if you want to like text your friend and be like where are you? You can't like if you're lost you are lost next it's so fucking expensive if it was cheaper I wouldn't be as harsh but because it's Literally anywhere between like four hundred and fifty dollars in like two thousand dollars depending on when you buy your ticket Or if your VIP etc I spent like nine dollars a day on coffee. This is actually a lie I literally spent 27 dollars a day on coffee because I bought a minimum of three And they're each nine dollars meaning that I spent a minimum of twenty seven dollars God I got in acai bowl one day and that she was fourteen dollars I mean it would have been twelve, but I wanted almond butter on it So that added two dollars. I don't care the only cheap thing at cochella is the water bottles in there two dollars each, which if you really think about it It's still kind of a lot, but whatever also buying your outfits for it are expensive because that's like the whole point of Coachella it's the outfits and like the pictures and making it look fun when it's really like not as fun as it actually looks so that's All the cons now, let's talk about the pros number one the vibes are good You're gonna meet a bunch of different types of people you're probably gonna see some celebs which is always fun but like if you Don't go to Coachella Just to see the celebs because you'll look at them from far away and be like whoa and then That's it and it's like is that really worth a 700 dollar ticket? No. Everybody's just trying to have a good time except for the pedophiles They also actually are trying to have a good time but like not Kind of good time that we like in this community Another Pro is that? It's super fun to post about it on Instagram and make everyone else hate their lives that aren't there the way that people make it Look on Instagram wow like it's a lie like I mean I'm being honest like it looks so fun on Instagram like I remember all the years I was like oh my god like that looks so amazing and it's cool But like it is not as fun as it looks on Instagram the amount of like struggles that we dealt with throughout the whole thing Was like absurd I feel like that's about it. So that's all the pros and cons Overall I think I'd rate Coachella a 6 out of 10. It's exhausting afterwards. You're like this is just Like I can't even believe I just went through that Hopefully that shed some light on what it's really like and you can like make a decision more educated Lee now everybody else Lying to you guys being like Coachella so fun its the perfectestttt thing i loooovvee it who knows if i will be going next year, i dont know I don't know if I can do that again, but then again. It's one of those things where it's like It's kind of worth it tho follow emma chamberlain on instagram and vsco if you want"
ulMu3TxDk7I,thank you,,2018-04-22T15:56:56Z,163478,1653092,20767,"My dumb ass, I'm about to fucking cry or some shit I'm like so....no crying allowed Give me a minute, let's cool down a little bit. I'm a little bit emotional, right I was like I did not think I never cry well that's a lie I cry all the time *beyonce being a queen* For starters, I don't know how the fuck that happened Wow okay? Thank you, I normally don't get like real sappy on this channel You know just cuz I just don't feel like it's my vibe I don't know how to deal with that kind of emotion it makes me uncomfortable But I feel like this is kind of different, and I feel like I owe you guys. Thank you. Thank you for Watching my videos supporting me putting up with me dealing with me interacting with me and being my friend Oh when, I first started my channel. I literally did it cuz I was sad, and I had no friends now I feel like I have a bunch of friends do I? No :( but I feel like I do because you guys make me feel Happy and like not as lonely. So thank you for that throughout my youtube channel I was kind of got roasted for not bringing attention to milestones every time I hit a milestone I wouldn't say anything about it and people would be like you're so ungrateful You just hit said number blahblahblaaaah and people would be like why don't you think you're like? Supporters because I've never thought about it like that. I never looked at it as like. Oh, I just hit this milestone That's a really bad way of explaining that I never really thought of like a number of subscribers in that way because for me It's always been a one-on-one encounter if that makes sense I don't think about it as me talking to this crowd of people I was thought about it as me connecting with one person one-on-one So every time I did a milestone. I'm like I don't want to bring attention to this specific number because to me every single Person is like important and putting everybody into a number doesn't feel fair to me So that's always been my mindset with that but the reason why this one is different is because I Really didn't think that this would ever happen when I first started my channel I did it for fun because as I said earlier I had no friend *sobs*, and I wanted something to distract me and to kind of like take my mind off things You know take the edge off and like the fact that it like did this I mMMmmmM I still can't a lot of people are like Emma's gonna change now, but that is not the case okay Let me tell you it's always gonna be me with my coffee. It's always gonna Be me in the car always gonna be me doing me at this point I think you guys know you're not coming to my channel for anything like a Value the only thing that we have here is that you're my friend. I'm your friend We got each other's back and let's just have a good ass time the kind of videos I make might change the way I look might change hopefully I'm ugly right now, but the end of the day it's always gonna be me and it's always gonna be you I just wanted to thank you guys for sticking by me being the coolest fuckin group of people on the internet I swear to god. You guys are so cool you guys understand me you understand my humor we laugh together We cry together and we stay together ride or die gang. You know what I'm saying if it was up to me I'd give you a guys all big hugs separately Individually, I would go through every single one of you and give you squishy hugs because I've been told I give good hugs And that's honestly a really good skill to have like have you ever gotten like a shitty ass hug And you're just like why you're like slimy on me, I'm sorry I'm getting a lot of text from like my mom being like Emma no one likes you shut up You're probably like Emma shut the fuck up with this corny shit miss me with that shit But no YouTube has been a crazy journey. It's been one of the most like emotionally challenging journeys of my life You know at times. I just wanted to not do it. I was like, I'm fucking done. I'm done like I can't do this anymore It's so much work. I'm tired. It's just makes you like question like why the fuck am I doing this, but at times It's so fucking awesome, and one of those times is like right now But it's not even like the times like right now that make it worth it It's like all the little times that I get to like interact with you guys tweet back and forth with you guys And we like laugh together and you guys are like Emma deactivate like no one likes your Twitter. I'm like okay It's all the little things this is the best shit I've ever done in my life and advice that I would give you is if you want to start a YouTube channel Do it do it for the right reason do it because you genuinely Like making videos do it because you want to connect with more people do it because because you think you could add something Positive and great to this world, but even when you think I'm never gonna get anywhere with this You're probably wrong and you probably will get somewhere with it You just have to keep going because there were so many times when I'm like yep I'm wasting my time But if you just keep pushing and you keep going through that horrible feeling there's no way you won't pass #WIN And that's all I got to say thank you guys. I love you guys follow your goddamn dreams Whatever you want to do do it because you have no Clue how successful you're gonna be at something until you try it I could go on all day about this shit I just love you guys with truly my entire heart like I don't love a lot of things okay I hate most things actually and you guys are one of those things that I genuinely care about with my entire heart and feel so Much like unconditional love for I love you guys more than I love some of my family members haha just kidding No, but really though. We have a connection. That's so special I don't know if it's like maybe just me like maybe I'm just sorry. I don't know what's going on. Hopefully I'm not the only one that feels this feel like I truly feel connected to you guys in my soul and like that's something That's so special to me. I could never express how grateful. I am for that. I just love you. That's all I'm gonna say. I'm gonna cut it off Cheers. Thank you for sticking along. Let's just keep doing what we've been doing Let's keep having fun laughing crying together and going through this journey of life together bye, I love you"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-04-12T18:38:55Z,254299,10627796,9618,"Hi ladies and gents What's up, guys? How you guys doing today? I'm just chilling in Cedar Rapids, so yeah Today is Saturday April 7th, and I'm starting my Coachella prep. Let's backtrack for a sec Coachella is coming up April 13th through 15th or 12th through 14th or I don't give a fuck Coachella is a music festival if you didn't already know and it's basically the most annoying time of the year for everybody who's not not going, and I would know because for my entire life I've been the person who didn't go and had to watch everybody else on social media be there Yeah, it's the most annoying shit of all time. It's literally so fucking annoying. I'm like triggered because it's so Fricking annoying, but this year I am blessed enough to be actually going Being one of the annoying people I always used to like make fun of people who are at Coachella. I'd be like haha guys you're stupid, Coachella is stupid? What the...fuck? Like I wouldn't want to be there like I wouldn't want to be seen like all those cool artists are wearing those outfits or Eating those popsicles or like riding on the ferris wheel like I would never want to do that. Well this year I'm doing that and I'm really fucking excited about it I thought it'd be kind of fun if I documented all of the things I have to do I'm popular I thought it'd be fun if I documented all the things I had to do in order to prepare for Coachella because there's a lot, okay. It's not easy I remember when I would like look at all the girls going to Coachella I'm like wow that looks so fun like they just get to pick out their outfits and like they're all tan and their nails are Done their hair is done like wow they look so good, but there's so much more behind it than what meets the eye I'm pale my nails are disgusting look that one's broken my roots are all grown out like I'm a Mess I have so much. I have to do and I literally leave in like less than a week. Oh yeah quick shout out to Dote because Dote is actually sending me to Coachella Let's just get right into the process Coachella prep 2018 is it 2018 I feel like it's still 2017. No. It's 2018. Okay. That's weird What's up?! Okay, so step one hair I am getting my hair dyed because I'm just a hoe like that Basically as you can kind of probably see maybe I've like really heavy highlights, and I basically just need to get my roots done There's a fucking truck in the middle of the road and I am literally late to my appointment so it'd be really great if you didn't think that I want to die okay how am I gonna do this. Okay. We're really having you do a little detour here. Okay. Bye Fuck it's really fucking hot in here no wonder if it's the heater is on why do I have the frickin car heater on? I'm so stupid hair is one of those things that is like if your hair looks good Everything makes sense it frames your face, and it frames your heart also I'm gonna see if she can make my whole head more blonde even though the answer is probably no because every single time I've ever Gone
and asked it been like can you guys make my whole entire head a little bit more blonde the answer has always been no because they Say that my hair is already too bleached and that all my hair will fall out and then I'll be bald so like I don't Want that then I don't know okay, my life's a mess. Yeah, yes, I will see you guys after I get my hair done I'll try to do a little bit of clips while I'm in there, but I'm just a lazy bitch, so we'll see Hi now blonde again or at least like my roots are blonde again There's a little bit of kind of feel like that line of brown, but whatever I don't give a frick I just sat in that chair for like four hours And I just need a burrito or something but should I eat a burrito probably not because Beyonce's going vegan before Coachella Okay, what's up? Guys? It's currently Sunday So the next day and today we have a new project as you know one of the most important aspects of Coachella is the outfits Duh, I've been working on my Coachella outfits for months and because of that I will not be showing them to you right now because Why would I show you them before when I'm supposed to like really Debut them on the day of the festival I won't be doing that I'm gonna be showing you a little Coachella haul some of it was sent to me by Dote some of it I bought with my own money some of it I found in the trash can Bad joke some of it. I'm gonna wear some of it. I'm not gonna wear These aren't gonna be my outfits if that makes sense. I don't know whatever enjoy Oh, yeah, also not that you care, but I'll have like the store in the top. You. Don't give a fuck okay It's the next day, and I'm stressed one of my favorite outfits that I have planned for Coachella fucking duh, I'm obsessed with it It's like super dynamic and like interesting and like fascinating and edgy The glasses that I initially picked out for it, I realized when like shown in the light Don't match the outfit as well as I was planning basically the glasses don't match. I'm obsessed with this outfit I'm not gonna like let it go and glasses are like the most important aspect of an outfit in my opinion And so I need to freaking get some glasses right now. I'm so I'm going to mall and I'm gonna get it And that's just where we're at that's what we're doing today and then let's just Let's just go let's just see what we can find and just see what we can do and see we can find this here we Can do ahh Hi, so we're back from the mall and Eww I literally went into probably seven stores bought a bunch of stuff that I didn't need Just stuff that I wanted for my life And I'm not gonna be showing you that because this video is about Coachella not about my life But I did find one pair of glasses and they are these They're kind of ugly they're actually really ugly and I actually immediately regret buying them and the moral story is that they're gonna bug lis like I They're definitely ugly, and I regret them They looks better in the store, so you'll be seeing if I wear these probably not because they're a little bit fucking crusty Okay, hi. Sorry thought I'd have a little jam sesh next task nails you heard that right ladies gotta get the nails done and gents Not assuming your gender. I have acrylics my middle finger is broken. It's been broken for like two weeks I'm not excited about to get these done by to get these beats I don't know color I'm gonna get I'm thinking I'm gonna get monochrome nails kind of like that because I think that's kind of sick kind of festival dives We'll see if they have the monochrome nails here. I think that they do or not monochrome. Yeah monochrome, or is it whatever oh? My god these hoes fucking clean bitch now give you a little montage afterwards. They came out so Flippin cool. I should clean for Coachella Kill me okay Hey guys Hey guys probably gonna hit this car right here Don't really hit this car early in the mood for that today, but today is the last day before I leave for Coachella I'm doing pretty good. I only have a few more things, but I do have quite a few things I have to do to it. First of which is a juice cleanse Now you guys are probably like Emma really, and I don't mind you I'd be saying the same thing I'm doing a juice cleanse today because so many people do juice cleanses before Coachella I don't know why I originally wasn't gonna do one. I just like did it didn't even cross my mind, but last night I was at the gym trying to get ripped you know and I felt kind of shitty you know and you like eat a lot Of food, and you just feel really like full, but like sick at the same time I don't know how to explain the feeling it's not good though And so I was like how the fuck am I gonna make this feeling go away Then I saw on somebody's Instagram Story that they were doing in juice cleanse and I'm like I bet doing a juice cleanse would make me feel less like shit now here we are driving to the press juicery. I'm only doing a one day juice cleanse because honestly I don't think I could do a Longer than one day juice cleanse cuz I love food way too much I'm leaving for Coachella tomorrow And I'm also uploading this video tomorrow meaning that I have to have this video done by tonight meaning that I can't give you guys An update because I'll still be doing the cleanse while I'm uploading this video if that makes sense I thought okay well then then Emma. Why are you even showing you doing a juice cleanse if you're not gonna talk about it Well, here's what I'm gonna do I'm going to do a little taste test of all the juices that I'm gonna have to drink today? And then I'm just going to talk about how they taste even though I'm not gonna talk about the effects of the juice cleanse You're probably like Emma. What are you gonna do about coffee if you can't drink coffee today, bitch. Don't worry I happen to be drinking coffee while I do this juice cleanse I know you're not supposed to drink anything But the juice like you're not supposed to have caffeine you're not supposed to have alcohol That's an issue for me cuz I'm 2 years old, but I don't give a literal fuck. Can you not ride my ass? Comment down below if you want me to vlog at Coachella   I forgot I was filming fuck Hey guys just got to the press juicery can't wait so excited to see what happens, I'll see you guys once I have my juice Hey my juice got my press freeze this is like my favorite food this and burritos favorite food also
So dope we go to press Juicery so much that I had enough points to get 15% off of my juice cleanse How awesome kind of nervous for this juice cleanse because what if I have to drink a whole juice that tastes like shit I bet That's gonna happen the lady said that you should start your juice cleanse at like 8:30 a.m.. It's 11:30 a.m. So I'm three hours behind, but that's a-okay someone just pulled into this parking spot next to me Now I can't be myself Do you know what I'll move Jesus crisis tight spots of really fucking I can't even get in too fucking tight That's what she said. I don't want to sorry. Oh God. Okay. Sorry for all of that confusion Let's try out the juices now you already know the drill okay. I'm gonna try these now I'm not drinking them now okay first one kale spinach romaine parsley cucumber celery apple and lemon that sounds fucking horrible. Let's see how it tastes Well not great, but I think I'll be able to tolerate it Hopefully juice number two pineapple apple lemon mint this one will be easy let's try it out Oh, yeah This one's super nice super nice juice number three kale spinach romaine parsley cucumber what I have to drink this one twice This is the exact same one is the first one and I already know It's mediocre at best so that's juice number for this one. I'm afraid of beet apple lemon ginger I hate beets so let's see how this goes it's pretty though. Oh, this is actually not bad at all This is super pleasant okay, not too shaby. Juice number five cucumber pineapple lemon coconut water aloe vera See how it is okay, this one's ass Ew. I think the cucumber's throwing me off ew because it's kind of bitter Ugh, no. No can't wait to drink that later the last juice is super yummy, and I know because I've had this one It's vanilla almonds dates vanilla sea salts super good, but we'll try it anyways super good damn boy. Yeah, really fucking sexy They give you two waters that you're supposed to be drinking first water They give you is this chlorophyll water, which is basically water with chlorophyll in it I think it just tastes like normal water, but I can't tell It tastes kinda weird I can't tell if it actually tastes weird Or if it's just the fact that it's green is like playing with my mind and making me think it tastes weird I don't know But something about it rubs me the wrong way Then I'm supposed to be drinking this aloe vera water right before bed because it's supposed to act as a laxative she told me so that's disturbing I don't like how that tastes at all ew you know it tastes like soap water oh This is gonna be a hard one to get down aloe vera water. Not a fan of it Okay, and then last but not least I got this wellness shot that has ginger lemon and cayenne in it this isn't a part of The cleanse this is just for funsies actually I've already had these before and I know that they taste like ass So I'm taking the wellness shot Cheers Fuck ew Not doing good yeah, this whole experience is not gonna. Be easy. Hopefully I poop a lot I just like to give a little update and let you know that um while I was drinking one I and I was driving. I was drinking and driving, but not what you think I was drinking pressed juice not.... alcohol anyways when I was drinking it   I gagged like really bad and like threw up a little bit This is not gonna be easy. Okay well that's it I literally I've consumed one juice and I've already like threw up cuz it tasted bad I feel like I'm gonna throw up still so like this is not good. Okay well Hello and for the next step, I am naked I don't think you can see any of my body parts Don't want to get demonitized so I just got out of the flippin shower And it is time to fake tan because you girl is pale. I'm not gonna get spray tan today instead I'm using loving tan. This is not spons but I wish it was because I love loving tan this is ultra dark for Experience tanners only which I am because I used to do cheer and I had to fake tan all the time So let's just hop right into it. Let's get right into it. I thought while we were tanning We could just talk about our feelings, so there's gonna be a lot of times where you can't see my face But as long as you can feel my presence. That's all that matters. Also, I have a feeling you're gonna End up seeing one of my nips at some point So we'll see. My mirror's all fogged up Jesus Crist I'm gonna put it on my butt cheeks That's fine, this is quite the process, but I feel like usually when I do fake tan I like half-ass it cuz I'm like if it looks like shit like what ever dissever actually want it to look good so like That's what I'm really gonna try hard today. You know it's the hardest part about fake tanning getting your back It's so flippin hard might have to have my mom come in and do my back mommy Do you want me to do my back? I need assistance? Thank you mommy Also, if you guys wanted a little inside scoop the scariest part about fake tanning is doing your face guess what time it is guys It's time to do the face. I'm scared I get scared into my face. Oh shit. That's so much great. I look good Okay, and that's it for today's video I'll see you at Coachella if you want you can follow me on Instagram and you can see all the pics right when they come out And you can follow me on Twitter because I'm gonna be tweeting about what's actually Happening rather than like Instagram where it's like what you think's happening And then Twitter is like   Or you can just wait for my Coachella vlogs to come out where you can see the vlogs so we're really gonna be documenting this Whole thing get excited get pumped or don't I don't really care. That's it. I love you guys Maybe I'll see you at Coachella peace out Love you also I'm going to Playlist Live so maybe I'll see you there too. Okay. Bye Orlando Playlist Live Orlando, Playlist Live Orlando  "

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-04-02T21:47:59Z,367485,7310360,21256,"Hey, what's up you guys yes. hello guys welcome back to my channel today's video is going to be very serious ((creepy music)) I'm serious. I know lately conspiracy theory videos have been really-uh, you know popping off actually not even lately I feel like they've always been popping off. Shane Dawson started the trend and then now we all can't stop. Americans just can't get enough (AMERICA FUCK YEAH) Every time I watch a fucking conspiracy theory video, I'm pretty sure my IQ raises like a few pegs. I don't know okay. It really makes you think. After watching like hundreds of conspiracy theory videos in my life I've kind of like grown an eye for some sketchy shit. I literally see something and I'm like okay I like know what's going on here like you're not slick bitch. But like while I see all of these things not everyone else sees them like I do. Not everyone can comprehend the level of conspiracy that I am able to comprehend and because of that I decided that today I would compile all of the conspiracy theories that I have (currently) that I came up with. UM, WAKEUPSHEEPLE hehe Anyways, and I would just share them with you. I might in this video be exposing your fave, and that's okay like take it from me; we're in a safe space right now me and you we're in this safe space no one can touch us let's just go right into it. Jake Paul the *incoherent fumble of words* We love him! His content, we love him we love everything about him He's a king and so is his brother, but we don't have a conspiracy about his brother today because we just don't uh hehe *sip* Jake Paul five million on YouTube in six months (never done before) he's a absolute YouTube beast. He's doing great for him all-for all of them. He's doing great for all of us a'right And he's really inspirational for me and for other little kids who need guidance And I'm basically a fetus so I also love him. This one is one of the most convincing photographic conspiracies, I've ever seen in my life, and let's just hop right into it. Jake Paul here he is just take a little look at him look in his eyes kind of I don't know get familiar with his face. Good. Now, let's take a little look at Herman Munster. If you don't know who Herman Munster is he is let me actually read what the fuck he is. 'a fictional character in the CBS sitcom The Munsters' aka like an old show that old people watched, but I'm actually not old I'm in fact actually a newborn child if you can't tell by my appearance. My dad actually brought to my attention that Jake Paul looks strikingly like the dad Herman Munster, or is it Herman or Herbert? The fuck I don't know Jesus Christ. I didn't watch the fucking show. Herman! Now if you look at them side-by-side, I mean they really do truly look almost exactly alike, but when it gets truly, truly frightening is when you actually overlap their photos, and you see that their facial structure aligns almost exactly. Their smile is identical, their forehead size; identical. Receding hairline; identical. I don't know man This next conspiracy theory *cry* (sad music) Will have you fucked up. My next conspiracy is about the family favorite, David Dobrik. Everyone loves him, he's a vlogger, he's dating Liza Koshy (everyone loves Liza Koshy). He has a great squad; who doesn't love David Dobrik, right? Well your opinion might change today because I just found out something about David Dobrik that is absolutely heartbreaking and here's what it is. So the other day, I was on David Dobrik's YouTube channel, and I was just chilling right; there scrolling through his videos And I find that every single video is 4 minutes in 20 seconds long *disgusting nose scratching sound* Now if you're just rolling through his channel homepage. It shows that every single video is four minutes and 21 seconds *disgusting nose scratching sound* Oh god I have allergiesss   * SNEEZE* Uh fuck but if you actually click on his videos they're in fact four minutes 'n 20 seconds long What do you know about the number 420? WEED. Yeah, David. Marijuana, pot, the devil's grass, dank... what do people call weed I don't even know david dobrik smokes weed people and this is not it this is not the end of this theory his profile picture on YouTube as you can see it's a picture of him looking up at The camera like a fucking guilty slob *INHALE* Sorryuh... as you can see it's him just chilling with a white background Completely white background which is number one racist and number two and looks like he's floating in a cloud a lil' weird Why would he choose that why would he choose a profile picture that makes him look like he's floating in a cloud Because what happens when you take a little inhale of the weed, and you exhale it?? Clouds. Of weed. But it doesn't end here doesn't in here, and that's the thing it continues on his Instagram I went deep down into his fucking Instagram and what I found was absurd the first photo I found plus on February 4th 2015 David posts a selfie in what looks like a desert or some shit? I don't give a fuck if you zoom into the background of this photo number one you see a person But that's not important if you scroll a little bit to the left actually to the right sorry I don't have a brain you see that. There's literally a piece of weed in this photo I have nothing else to say about that moving on David posts on August 14 2014 a picture of some weird ass will confirm pizza this pizza looks like it literally Is from a trampoline park caption. Holy shit imagine this david dobrik on a nice August summer night in 2014 just lit up the bomb with the Buddies right just completely took so many rips off of that bomb just took so many bong rips just had just took a Puff off of that going it's high out of his mind and post this photo of pizza with the caption. Holy shit It's the only logical explanation for why you'd post a picture of this weird ass fucking pizza I've seen a lot of pizza slices in my life But the way that the cheese is falling off the side is upsetting and disturbing And the only person that would enjoy sad pizza is a freaking pothead, but it doesn't end here I saw another photo that David Dobrik posted in 2014 Actually this one was in November to be exact of him with some what seems to be Popeyes Chicken Look at all those chickens Funny David we know your secret that man looks way, too Excited about that freaking chicken everyone knows that Popeyes isn't even that great actually I wouldn't know I'm a vegetarian and I've never eaten it before but I was like you know what pictures speak a thousand words Right, but this picture only speaks one word to me and that word is munchies David There's only one reason that you'd be posting all these pictures of food is that you have munchies because you're a fucking Pothead moving on the last piece of evidence for this theory is probably the most damning in my opinion And that's this photo as you can see it's a picture of David in the street wearing some shorts a shirt Insane some mid-calf socks in some vans um yeah, try and tell me the your man crush Monday Doesn't put on that outfit before going to smoke a dunk with the buds to go hit the bomb with the buds? This picture was posted in November of 2015 a little bit older than the last few photos And he's still a fucking pothead. Sorry David. It's not my fault that you just lost all of your freakin fans Next conspiracy is about the one in the only the Tana mojo. She is the story time queen She is the story time goddess she serves us Content now Tana Um you don't know I exist probably and I hate to do this to you because I know this is your big secret But I'm gonna do it to you right now Tana mojo, right? Let's get a little background on this one because that's the only way that it'll make sense okay Here's Tana now when you look at Tana. You're like she looks like she's 28, right? That's what I think anyways. I should no clue how old Tana was when I looked into the first time. I was like well She's probably like 25 maybe 40 no just kidding just kidding, but she looks old not like old like oh this bitch has wrinkles Tana Please don't make a storytime about me She's 19 does that look like a teen to you know when I found out this information I knew that she was lying to us And I have proof all of the proof comes from her Instagram and it all starts with her birthday her birthday is June 24th Nineteen something I have to google it I forget Tana mojo was born on a bright summer day specifically June 24th 1998 and she's 19 Here's what I found a day after tannaz birthday in 2017 Tana posted this photo with her friend looks like they're just posing Amongst, that's the word I'm illiterate amongst some construction And if you look on the floor the word No appears on the floor weird a little bit weird right well it gets a little bit weirder once I saw this I was like whatever you know what this probably has a hidden meaning But it just didn't make sense to me yet I continued scrolling back into her Instagram And I found this photo this photo was posted also June 25th, but the Year previous when looking at this photo I was like sorry also look at my computer. It's over here get over it get over yourself Immediately this photo struck me as being very interesting especially because I couldn't find her and it actually took me like probably salt five minutes to find her until I realized she's just The only blog one in the photo, but this is an irrelevant fact if you zoom in you can see that There's this little poster. I don't know pop up in piece of whatever the fuck on it It says VidCon as you can see a little bit blurry VidCon the last two letters on flip those letters, No What are the odds that an emoji would post a picture on June 25th of 2016 and of? 2017 both with the word no present in their photos What does this tell me people this tells me the ten emoji was not in fact born on June 24th? 1910 --i was born on June 25th 1998 she is actually one day older, I knew Tana was older than I thought but I didn't know it was gonna be this intense So some heavy shit right there, but anyway Next moving on to jennxpenn she is a funny comedy kind of youtuber she also acts I think she's pretty cool the conspiracy about her is that she's actually me. Yeah pretty weird I've gotten a lot of comments being like yo, you look like jennxpenn well I should have a conspiracy that were the same person don't really have any evidence on this one But if you look at his side by side, we kind of look alike I mean, I personally don't see it, but since one of my opinions ever been important And if the internet thinks that we look alike then that means that we're probably the same person more on that later ""music"" this one is also short the dolan twins.... their holograms My life is ava. She's always on the go. She's traveling she seems like a great gal Well this conspiracy is actually not about her YouTube and it's actually in fact about her Instagram and about her life in general But her Instagram is where all the evidence are, so let's just get right into it I have a conspiracy that IVA is actually on Vacation at all times and actually has never been to her house, but it is scrolling through her Instagram And I realized that every single photo that she posts is in a different location She'll be in Australia, then. She's in you know the book llamas or some shit, then she's in Hawaii She's in Hawaii like every week, and I'm just like bitch. Do you go home? No, that's the thing I think she has a house somewhere where it is No one knows But I don't think she ever goes there because I've never seen her post a picture being like yo selfie in my room I scrolled back into her Instagram D I did some deep fuckin scrolling, and I could not find a picture of her not on vacation I literally scrolled all the way back to 2015 and I found this photo Okay, given in 2015 when she was using Instagram filters and flash tattoos She still was on fucking vacation, so I something a stalker, maybe I don't know okay my life Is ava has been on vacation for three years, and she will never come home. Um. That's my story Next we have Jason Knapp Jason nash the world's favorite old man. Just kidding That's a joke Jason if you're watching this which you're not, but um no Shane. I love you dad It's whatever Jason - friend of david dobrik the pothead Jason nash shows up in a lot of david Dover's vlogs which is normal and as far as the world knows David dobrik and jason nash have no actual relation blood wise and they're just kind of like you know friends right well This is a little sketchy to me because why would a young? Pothead like David be friends with like a 40 year old man such as Jason Nash I know Jason Nash is probably a fun guy, but personally if I was a 20-something year old pothead I would never hang out with a Middle-aged man, but maybe that's just me I did a little bit more research And I saw Jason and David to me together seem like the classic uncle-nephew kind of relationship And I first found this photo of them together Jason and David just chillin and when you look at them together Do they look alike not really but have you ever seen an uncle and their nephew look like no so that's not even important But if you zoom in on this photo, and you look at Jason's face pretty basic, man We've seen many of these in our life. I googled the word uncle just to see what I could find I found this photo stock photo of an uncle pretty quirky photo if you ask me I mean wearing some weird-ass glasses But none of that's important and a fedora bad choice But that's none of my fucking business if you zoom into this uncle's face And you compare it to Jason Nash. They are identical literally look at this shit I actually couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this the number one stock image for uncle is identical to jason nash And you're trying to tell me the jason nash isn't david dobrik uncle you're Stupid if you look at this stock photo and you zoom in to the stock like logo thing you have a camera no one gives A fuck well in the photo of Jason and David you zoom in to Jason's hand what is he holding a fucking camera? Insane and to make matters even more convincing david dobrik has merged with that exact kind of camera on it Are you fucking kidding me jason nash. You're david's uncle just come out and it made it already. Yeah can pussy oh god I'm getting tired from this shit conspiracies are exhausting Next conspiracy is about our favorite beauty guru. Everyone's favorite beauty guru or at least mine. I don't know Jeffrey star he's a king He's a queen he's everything that we want in a person actually it all started when I was talking Jeffrey Starr's Twitter And I saw that he lives in Calabasas, California Immediately that sparked my interest who else lives in Calabasas the Kardashians I've always had a suspicion about you every star that he was something more something bigger than what we could understand or comprehend But I didn't realize it was this big I was scrolling through Jeffery stars Instagram, and I found this photo that he posted on February 13th of this year It is a photo of him and in this photo. He looks particularly like Buzz Lightyear I don't know. Maybe the lighting was weird or something, but after seeing this I was like weird I'll keep it in the back of my head and a few days later. I see this photo I was just googling the Kardashians aimlessly You know just being like Kardashians seeing what would pop up in this pops up Kourtney the oldest sister with Jeffery star It's funny insane to me that they literally have photos together. That's it That's the end of that conspiracy, but I mean I'm pretty sure it's true so fuck off. I don't care Casey Neistat, vlogger, family fav I've never met someone who didn't like Casey Neistat because you can't physically not like him and because of that he's a hologram Shane Dawson also a hologram This last conspiracy-  look at me and bae James Charles another amazing beauty guru. I'm not gonna lie I give him a view and in a nice like every time he posts a video And I also go onto his Instagram live streams And he ignores me every fucking time James if you're watching this what the fuck- sorry This one is definitely the most insane conspiracy out of this entire video And I want you to buckle your seatbelt for this one because you might not sleep ever again So James Charles has a little cute little intro that he does every single video where he says hey sisters Cute right, I mean it makes me feel special when he calls me a sister actually I think he says hi sisters I don't fucking know anyways whatever HI SISTERS x3 The phrase ""hi sisters"" in dutch, is pronounced ""hallo zussen"" what does that fucking sound like to you? like if that was like in English What would that sound like to you in English ""hallo sussen- zussen"", whatever the fuck, sounds almost exactly like Hello Susan. Now, this is when the shit gets fucking scary Susan, the CEO of YouTube. James is not addressing us in his videos when he says hi sisters He's not talking to us. He's talking to Susan *sad music* (in a sad voice) So that's it for today's video.. *fake laugh* No, I'm like good. That's it for today's video I hope you enjoyed it, if you thought any of these were interesting This video might have shed some light on who they truly are"
d0ZJvU2ciBM,i went thrifting (again) and it was INTENSE,"i actually did things today

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-03-30T01:02:06Z,280842,9571466,10514,"And if you ain't a ho get up out my trap house   Good morning guys, it is 11:00 a.m. Not doing so good, actually no. I'm doing good. Lately, I've been waking up at like 8 a.m. cause my mom thinks that it's good when I wake up early so she's been waking me up every day at 8 a.m. And telling me get your fat *sigh* Get your ass out of bed, but today 11 because it's Saturday. We deserve a day off right ladies and gents We have a big day today's a big day, we have a lot of Tasks, oh my god. I like sneezed and almost peed. Lets get right into it Oh my god, you know that new dance move on -hold on. I kinda have it. I'm working on it Please comment down suggestions on how I can improve cause I wanna know how to get better. Oh my god it's taking forever. What the fuck. Why is it like that hey turn it down guys seriously? Why is it so overexposed? I literally? So if you're wondering what we're doing today, I will tell you that right now And I'll make it short because no one cares for starters. We're gonna go thrifting. I know everybody's probably like oh my god Thrifting? wow you're so cool and unique also I'm going to Cody and Noel show and I'm really Excited about it because we get to see Cody you get to see Kelsey they love them both so I'm really excited to see them How much Cody's chill so it's gonna be good time so stick so stick around if you're interested in watching me do those things We have three thrift stores that we're going to today the first one is right next to my house the second one is Salvation Army And the third one is a st. Vincent de Paul there was one thing that I wanted to discuss with you all and that is these bad boys hold on a sec Airpods Let's talk if you don't know what they are okay? I almost just hit this little kid because he's being so fucking stupid literally grow a brain bitch. Just kidding  my god This kids really being stupid. He's like riding a scooter in the middle of the street as if like he's invincible bitch You're not like stopping a little tool okay, baby Hey, dude the little kid almost just went in front of my car again with his fuckin scooter like I don't know who this kid is but He needs help. Anyways, airpods. Yes or no the short answer is yes the long answer is Fuck yes They are so overpriced and they are in fact a waste of money But they're basically headphones that you can just shove into your earlobes and fuck you. Oh, it's an old person. It's fine They're basically headphones but they're bluetooth and They fit your ears like Jesus Christ Himself would fit right into your ear if he was a headphone They don't fall out very easily They do sometimes fall out, but it takes a lot for them to fall out considering that they're just floating in your ears I'll show you how they look they just shove into your ear like that They look really sick like when you're wearing them you look like a fuckin genius, I just turned on the wrong Street god Damn it anyways amazing investment I am so glad that I bought them probably one of the best purchases of my life sick right the only thing that happened to Me that was a little bit disturbing. I was chillin at my desk all of a sudden I accidentally bumped one of them out of my ear which is a rare occurrence usually they just say in your ear all the time and Never even like budge. That's the word is it the word budge never even budged Yeah, they don't budge, but sadly it fell out and it fell into my shirt first I took off my hoodie to see if I could like jiggle it out somewhere couldn't find it then I took off my Shirt mind you I was alone so this is not weird well it's still kind of weird and couldn't find it then I think that they might have fallen into my Pants or like into my pocket because I was wearing sweats, so I'd pull down my sweatpants next thing I know I'm fucking naked and I still have not found my air pod I soon realized that it had been on my seat the whole time And I just had failed to check to see if it was it on my seat and there it was that's the only negative Experience that I've had with an air pod so far and honestly is that really detrimental, No Thank you so much. Apple for another great product I Stan Can hate that word, but now that we've had our little air pod rant. Let's go through it, but first You have no clue what I'm listening to right now ooh swag My god Literally gonna dog oh my god. I can't believe this is happening right now. Oh We got it That was the scariest moment of my life my air pod fell in between My seat and like the glove compartment or whatever. I was so fucking scary. I'm literally shaking okay anyway I thought it was gone forever. It wasn't though so we're fine I have never had a more successful thrift trip in my fucking life. I got so much good shit I might not even go to the other two thrift stores because I just got so much shit okay before I do this haul I'm Gonna make it quick and I'm gonna make it spiffy I might even make it a try on haul if I'm feeling generous, but you'll find out later I spent thirty dollars on all of this shit. Just get ready. I got so much stuff, okay I didn't try on anything, so I don't even know some of the stuff I might not even like and I might sell it But anyways this big hoodie thing that has like buttons super freaking cool and swag Grandpa would definitely wear that but we work with it I got a shit ton of t-shirts so get ready first one edible arrangements how fucking sick is that that's just funny I just can't wait to wear that and have people be like why another graphic tee that will confuse everyone, Nintendo How fun is that like I was a ds4 next these pants are weird, and I'm gonna get judged But I don't care if they're these like stretchy waist pants. They kind of look like nurse pants These are literally the ugliest pieces of shit. I've ever seen I don't know what these are what is this? What is this who would ever wear this? I literally look like I'm like I don't know I don't know what I regret this then I got these okay These aren't even my size, and I'm just gonna sell them on my deep hop probably unless they somehow fit okay I don't know why I was so attracted to them, and they also kind of look like nurse pants But like just bear with me here. They're kind of like cargo pants, but like not like thin Um not only do these not fit me at all, but they're also really fucking weird. I regret this also I got this like weird inclination to go look into the plague little boys section Who kind of sounds creepy like the young men's section which I normally don't do cuz usually like child sizes wouldn't fit me But I guess today was an exception. I found these SiC high-waisted jeans by the brand Premium jeans where they're so cool. They have these like really cool. Details right here. This is like route 66 They're so sick next another t-shirt I don't know why I just kind of like how it's like Hawaiian style and I can just tuck it into jean shorts for the Summertime this next shirt is funny It says camping chick, and I just think that something about that's really kind of funny And I also love this color like olive green and also just look how sick she is Okay, this next thing is kind of frumpy, but whatever I think it's cool It's like hoodie material, but it has buttons like that this would like some leggings and like converse just really get chill day Okay this next thing sorry I'm talking so fast There's just so much shit and like you don't want a detailed description these next things are really cool And they probably won't fit me and now that I'm like looking at them like they're kind of big, but they're so cool and it's these Levi's they're like a really interesting color I Could literally eat cereal out of this in holes next thing I've never really seen anything like it so I thought they're kind of cool. They're like these cargo pants They're really soft and comfy material. Do you can be honest you don't really like these pants, so I'm probably gonna sell them Oh, maybe pop they're really fucking ugly, but I mean they're kind of cool I guess but they're really ugly on me, so yeah, it's the thought that counts I don't really like camo that much anymore. I kinda have like a camo face now I'm not really into it so I kind of like these cargo pants that like don't have camo on them That's really what I'm vibing goods lately I've just been really vibing with it so yeah last, but not least another stupid t-shirt honestly My mom's gonna be so mad at me for buying all these t-shirts because they take up so much space and I like never wear Them it's just like Vineyard shirt. I just thought that the design on it was like kind of cool I don't know why I just liked it like it Just spoke to me and I didn't fight the feeling so that was it that was my thrift haul it was good I guess I'll see you at the next thirst or peace out I Don't know what's happening today, but I've like never had a better thrifting experience in my life like I literally got so much shit So let's just do another haul I definitely got less stuff, but like still I'm sure as heck not mad So let's just get right into it first thing. What is this? Oh? Yeah, Navy turtleneck it has this cool little detail on it It's a turtleneck and I love turtlenecks, so I got this just playing that turtleneck. I don't really know why I got it I like this kind of knit like this kind of I don't know if it's cotton or yes, yes cotton sweaters because they're less itchy so that was a cool thing that I got I bet it was owned by a Grandma, but I don't really care next I got this big kind of like oversized just shirt And I also got this because I like the material and I just think it's like so comfortable I don't know. I kind of like something about that stripe. It just gives me kind of 90s vibes even though I don't know shit about the 90s so next thing I got is dead-ass the best shit. I've ever thrifted in my life It's this fuckin pink and green collared long-sleeve. It's Ralph Lauren which is just sick, and it's just like so perfect like it's literally the most perfect thing EE It's the most perfect thing I've ever seen there's only 10 bucks Which is a little bit expensive, but I don't really care so yeah next it's an Oxford College or Oxford University kind of like a Collared hoodie thing so sick like I don't know why I'm so obsessed with this I just love the like collegiate thing, and it was literally three dollars like why would my mind's made like Harry Potter? So that's good cuz I love Harry Potter last, but not least I got some pants. These are just like khaki style pants I can't tell if they're navy or black. I think they're black. I don't know just a good basic I also like the style of like khaki pants And I haven't been able to find ones that I like really love and I feel like these are really cool So I might love them this guy's staring at me blocking my car and calling it a day Okay, really freaked out right now feel like I'm gonna die whatever and then I know I said I was gonna go to another fur store today, but I am not anymore I also have a story to tell you guys because I don't know I like to update you on my life about something shitty that Happened to me yesterday, and I just thought maybe I tell you about it, so here's what happened yesterday ID I would postmates a burrito to my house And I was very specific that I wanted whole-wheat tortilla in two sides of salsa pretty self-explanatory you think apparently not I was very excited about it and it arrives at my house my new I had not eaten yet that day I was starving I was basically ravenous. Literally could have bit off someone's head if I was tempted enough I opened it up and already an issue arises. Okay. I noticed that there is no salsa They didn't give me my side of salsa, but I was like hey Do you know what everybody makes mistakes everybody has those days? I'm not gonna worry about it today is not the day we're not gonna freak out about this today We're gonna be chill. We're gonna be nice. I'll just have my burrito dry and crusty It's fine, so I wait a minute and kind of contemplate my life, and then decide that I would buy all over a plane's File like a complaint on post mates and just feel like they forgot my salsa like it's not a big deal But if you could give me a refund news the right lane after filing my complaint which was not a big deal I'm not like some sort of speak to the manager had a bitch. I'm pretty chill in life I bite into my burrito and immediately when I bite in a half a mile very soon after biting into this burrito Do I realize that this is not what I ordered I didn't expect What was gonna happen next my burrito had a tomato in it not like diced tomatoes like that kind of salsa or whatever? I'm just talking about one big fat in round ass tomato mind you I don't like tomatoes One of my least favorite foods I hate Tomatoes I will eat tomato sauce I will eat ketchup I sound like such a fucking bitch right now And I thought life couldn't get any worse and I was right it really couldn't get any worse. Oh wait Yes, it could so then I go to file another complaint and be like hi not only Did you not give me salsa? But you also put tomato in my fucking burrito and you know what when I'm eating a burrito the last thing I want is any sort of fruits or vegetable okay, I'm eating a burrito because I want a burrito I don't want a fucking salad bitch. I want a burrito I went to go file another complaint, and it said you already filed one complaint about this order And you can't file another one, at this point. I lose it.

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-03-24T02:05:18Z,309554,12447404,14691,"This is kind of an all-time low for me. How are you all hope you're all doing good umm Ok ha so this morning. I woke up, and I was like ok gotta film a video today Why is that guy staring at me Jesus? It's so weird out today ok whatever and as I was sitting there trying to come up with a video idea I realized wow Emma you are hungry, and you are emotional And you are a fucking Mess you need some food Basically just came up with this fucking idea that isn't even original because other people have done it before but I just thought I would Do it my own way. We're trying vegan fast food today Because I don't really ever get fast food because there really are no vegan Fast food options that are like actually good as far as I know but I still thought it could be kind of fun to like go to all the Favorite fast food places and just see what they have to offer vegan wise also I thought that this was perfect because it's raining and all of these fast food places are drive-through So I don't even have to leave my fucking car I can just sit in here and make my car smell like fast food and rot Our first stop is Jack-in-the-box and you might be saying Emma What in the world would they have that's vegan? Let me tell you number one actually they have quite a few options But I'm only gonna get two things from the menu because not everything really Looked good to me the first thing that they have how do I get in here do I go in this way? Jack-in-the-box here we come bitches the first thing they have is like some sort of teriyaki bowl And if you ask for it with no chicken, it's vegan and then also their curly fries, so I'm really excited We're actually here right now. Let me look at this menu Oh, they also have a side salad, but I'm not gonna fill with that. I don't mean that I literally don't know how to order from the drive-through, so I'm like really scared Hi, can I have a small curly fries the teriyaki chicken bowl with no chicken. That's it. Thank you This is so weird. Also. I don't even like jack-in-the-box. I've always been kind of a Burger King McDonald's You know kind of bitch I used to really like Chipotle - but Chipotle bucks me up ruins me destroys my stomach lining literally like melts my stomach lining and like just Evaporates it until I'm literally just a living piece of like rotten meat. That's so fucking gross this video is completely vegan Thank you so much. Oh my god Nervous my God my car already smells like shit from this Okay, first thing we're gonna be trying is the curly fries if they put this up, and they really fuck everything up Let's just get right into it Holy fuck are you fucking kidding? This is the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. Oh my god. This is not fine fair Are you fucking kidding? Me? These are the best fries? I've ever had in my life jack-in-the-box What the fuck literally 10 out of the 10? Okay now we're gonna try the teriyaki ball, which is really fucking concerning What the fuck oh my god, this is what it looks like It doesn't actually look that bad, but there's dead-ass literally No teriyaki sauce on it at all what so why don't they call the teriyaki bowl? It smells like cow manure like I know it's just vegetables, but it literally smells like a fucking cow let's try it anyways Okay, the rice is good, but it has like an undertone of like sock but It's rice. How bad did it fucking be you know what I mean, it does not smell good to me I mean I hate to be dramatic cuz I know this is like the broccoli smells like socks oh poor Emma But no, it's not appetizing, but I mean you do what you got to do Yeah, no that's just not good I mean I can imagine if it had a sauce on it Maybe it could be do a little bit like I give this a solid two out of ten. I Mean it's literally rice and vegetables it does the job, but it's just so flavorless, and there's no sauce on it It's just so boring and sad I grossed out like it kind of feels sick a little bit I literally just ate like one Broccoli and like some curly fries and that was it and I feel like I'm gonna vomit so I think this video is not off To the best start, but let's just keep a positive attitude attitude Next we're going to talk about slash Pizza Hut because they're like connected or whatever so supposedly talk about their Crunchwrap supreme is vegan if you ask for added black beans, and then you take away the sour cream nacho cheese and Beef Obviously, I'm have a slightly complicated order being like yeah Can I have like this with like not this and this they're probably gonna want to kill me But I don't really care and then also from Pizza Hut supposedly now They have a fordable vegan pizza, so that will be really fun if they have it I'm really hoping they have it if they don't have it then that aspect is canceled And we're just gonna get our talked about I think everybody should give Arby's no selfies Literally, I don't know what's going on in my head. I think that everybody should give jack-in-the-box Curly fries a chance because you won't be disappointed like they're genuinely good, and it's you're guaranteed a good time I'm also getting like meat sweats even though I didn't eat meat and also like I shouldn't be sweating Maybe I'm just anxious Literally the Taco Bell and McDonald's are right across the street from one another how fucking perfect is that for this video also this talk About fucking nice like they must have just updated it or some shit I feel kind of hashtag blessed to be in the presence of such a new and modern and tough about it's been raining so much Lately and it just makes me want to curl up in a ball and die Rain is depressing. Okay. It's time sour big moment. I'm kind of embarrassed to have such a complicated order, but whatever Thank you Are you guys not a Pizza Hut as well okay? No problem? Can I have the Crunchwrap supreme in add black beans? No beef sour cream or nacho cheese and can I have bottled water And yeah, that's it Okay, thank you So I guess this isn't a fucking Pizza Hut - my mom told me that this was a talk about and Pizza Hut together Guess what mom is not and I'm disappointed and I'm sad and I'm mad and I'm angry I was like really excited about trying the vegan pizza, so Literally the closest Pizza to me is 15 miles away alright that guys we're gonna find something else to replace it because that's fucking Cancelled so I'm really mad right now at least I get my special Crunchwrap supreme Oh, I think it has guacamole in it, and I don't really like avocados Hmm Whatever I know everybody's in the comments prolly gonna attack me for not liking avocados, but I don't so Like eh, thank you so much, okay, there's like nowhere to park Do I go oh I'll just park in the McDonald's parking lot. That's so far I feel like I could go to jail for that, but I'm gonna also. Oh this kind of smells good Okay, this like smells really good whereas my teriyaki bowl teriyaki bowl. Did not smell as good I'm kind of sad though because this wacom only in it, and I'm really afraid of avocados But I guess everything happens for a reason. Oh it's kind of true everything does happen for a reason oh Also, I love black beans, so I'm really excited. Oh, hi love black beans. I was literally like I Love them. I'm just saying What the fuck that was so scary why hopefully they didn't mess it up What if they accidentally put meat in it, and then I like take a bite into it? And then I eat the meat why am I like afraid of that like it wouldn't be the end of the world But I've been a vegetarian my entire life, so I've like never tried beef in my entire life. Yes I know it's been crazy most meats like scare me because I've never tried them before and I know everybody's probably gonna be like imma Make a video of you eating meat actually I bet no one's gonna say that in the McDonald's parking lot Let's try this bad boy. Oh Sure, this is hella. Good. My dad asked. Don't know what's in it, but it's really good. Sorry shit my teeth. Oh my god I never had a water whatever oh Shit, that's kind of a lot. Okay. Hopefully it's not too spicy, and I burned my mouth off Definitely good. It tasted like really like not that gross it's like okay You know and you like fast food and afterwards like I feel like literal ass right now like that was discussing that was like Relatively fresh and there was like vegetables in there and like black beans and like it was good I think the whole point with the Crunchwrap supreme is that it has I got whatever um It has like a courtier it has like a corn chip in it or some shit, and it was really good So I'd say that was a success for sure oh, I never I forgot to rate it. I would give that a solid seven out of ten Let's move on to the next one For our next stop rat McDonald's now We're already here because we were in the parking lot and here we're gonna be getting Apple pie and hash brown for your coffee. Do you guys have like almond milk? I'm sorry I have a hash brown and an apple pie. Thank you Holy shit, okay, sorry oh my god, I'm nervous why am I nervous here, we go big moment running on empty food review Oh, thank you so much. Oh my god first. We're gonna be trying the hash brown. I'm so fuckin pumped for this Mmm. I mean, yeah, I give this an 8 out of 10 Flaky crispy very good, but I wish it was thicker it's still really fuckin good though. Hey dogs ham eight out of ten I'm so glad I have water now very refreshing now. We're gonna try this fucking apple pie I could literally Looks like this. I suppose. I haven't really been showing the food. I've just been kind of eating it, but whatever oh My god, okay This is like really interesting the filling on the inside is like perfect apple pie feeling exactly what you want an apple pie filling It's hot but the crust has like a weird smell the crust kind of gives me like a little bit of cardboard vibes But overall it's really good. I'd give that probably like a six and a half out of ten Because it's really good and like the filling is really good, but it's not like oh my god This is the best shit. I've ever eaten in my life like I literally would die for this We're coming to a close we're almost done. I'm really fucking excited because I feel like shit right now I need to go take a nap and like not wake up for like three days This kind of food makes me want to like temporarily die Our last food we're gonna be getting today It's not even a really fast food, and I don't really know I threw it in here, but it just felt right to me But we're gonna be getting a Starbucks pink drink personally. I shouldn't gotten in lane. I fucked up anyways I'm pretty excited because I've always wanted to try a pink drink But I just like never had a reason to do it and I think that there might be a Starbucks drive-through near here And if that is okay, so then I will be in the dream If there isn't I might have to go inside for this one Which is like kind of defeats the whole purpose of like the fast-food thing iam pink drink Pink any drinka tea as James Charles would call it unless it's not vegan I like didn't even google it so it like might not be vegan I Do not want to get out of the car right now. I'm literally I'm wearing sweatpants my on my period yes You know why I just remembered the Starbucks is not a drive-through, so I do have to go in Brawl I should have thought that one through more, but what did we expect from me? I? Would pay money for this to be a drive-through freakin Starbucks? Sorry I've sent a lot of f-bombs today I'm trying to cut back on my cussing, but it's not going good. We're at Starbucks I don't even want to take you guys in there. I'm too lazy, so I'll see you when I get it It smells like strawberries which is like really yummy, so let's see how it tastes That's sad this is literally what Hello Kitty would taste like if she was like a flavor It definitely tastes like strawberry very very strawberry II it's just so sweet it tastes like juice I wouldn't get it again I'd probably give it a five out of ten I Mean it's okay, and like the flavors are like very like there, and it's not like watery, or gross I mean, it's fun, but that's about it for me But hey it was fun. I hope you had fun. I had fun. I need to go home and take a nap bye"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-03-19T23:19:31Z,123750,3220131,7357,"What's up guys *Aggressively sips coffee* *puts on chapstick* Wow I feel like we're just kind of back to normal for once. It hasn't been like this... It hasn't been like this for like a hot minute, like we haven't had this moment We haven't had THIS moment, and I missed it. So I decided today we would have this moment again We have an exciting day today I guess... I mean not really. Nothing's really planned But whatever. Let me make sure I have my driver's license with me or else if I ever get pulled over I'll get arrested and go to jail. It's raining today, which is annoying But I guess what can you do? Is this truck gonna kill me? I don't fucking know. They're blinking their lights. They're not doing much I'm just a little bit confused. Go ahead. Oh, thank you. ahhhhHHHHHHh Woooah I don't have an umbrella so that's not gonna be good for me. Today we're headed to the city. Just me. Just me and you, no one else. I haven't had a lot of time to myself lately, and I think it's messing with me I think it's kind of getting to my head because I'm starting to become *deep in thought* An insane bitch Like I was an insane bitch before, but like when I don't have My Emma time, I actually go insane. Did I even start the camera? Hold on.. yes thank f*cking God anyways When I don't have my alone time it f*cks with me and so to make a long f*cking story short We're gonna have a little date to ourselves today because I have nothing to do today I told myself that I'm not gonna go shopping Which is normally what I do when I go to the city, so I have no clue what I'm actually even gonna do... ...today You can probably hear the windshield wipers, and that's probably like really annoying so like this whole entire clip might be useless I won't know until I edit it so, Cheers. Anyways yeah, I really don't know what there Even is to do besides shopping like that's my only hobby when I go in public I love spending my money on things that like I shouldn't spend it on and then having no money left at the end of the Day.  Love that, um  *dead inside laugh* wait wtf Did I just got a text? I feel popular Nope, of course I didn't, no one likes me. Speaking of no one likes me, I'm lonely.. never mind Last night, I like accidentally stayed up until like 5:30 a.m. on accident because I felt like Really weird it was like I felt really weird in my stomach like my stomach felt weird And I just like could not fall asleep because it was so uncomfortable. I was listening to music and Okay you stupid f*cking Tesla we get it. I hate Tesla's anyways, so I felt really sick *shook* Holy shit, it's raining and people in California when it's raining Don't really know how to drive because it doesn't rain very often here Everyone's a little bit confused including me. None of us can see because we don't know how to see through the rain It's not that hard But we can't see but whatever I need to get to stop getting off-topic cuz I'm telling a story right now anyway well It's actually a really bad story So I don't even know I started telling it but to make a long f*cking story short. I was listening to music on my computer and I look one at one time in it's 3 a.m.. And then the next time I look it's 5:30 a.m. Could be because I ate chocolate before bed. Honestly, maybe and like you shouldn't do that. I heard it could give you nightmares Let me know if that's true. I wouldn't know I'm not smart. You know. I don't get my enough myself enough credit Maybe I am smart, and I'm just like undiscovered. let me merge *ahhhHhH* I'm afraid that I'm gonna die so yeah, it's 9:30 a.m.. Right now That's like pretty f*cking early for me bitches. I mean I'm killing it, honestly. Like when have you ever seen me up this early? I have not seen myself up this early in a hot minute. Oh my god Should I do like a mini playlist video and like show you guys the songs that I'm listening to right now because I think that I'd be a little bit cute. What do you think prepare to cringe so yeah? Wow haha Queen goes off to that one *alarm sound interrupts music* Honestly that songs really great. Don't get me wrong, but it's not hype so like I can't get hype to it. #HypeBeast There is one part of this song I am not even kidding. It is... *deep thought* literally when you hear it your penis will like fall off Okay, turn this bitch off okay, that's all I got for you guys today Music wise and we listen to like my entire almost my entire spring playlist so far I'm still adding some stuff by the end of spring that hoe is gonna have like a hundred songs on it cuz I'm generous so I guess I'll see you when we get there. That was kind of fun. That was fun for me anyways I don't care if you had fun because I had fun so F*ck off F*ck why am i still in reverse what the f*ck,  I hate driving in this area okay, hi so I just got coffee It was really good and then i--- Siri: in three quarters But then I realized that there's like no food places that appeal to me where I am right now So I decided that I would drive more to get food. What are we getting today for food? We're getting Asian box if you don't know what Asian box is I'll tell you. Asian box is this food that's really GoOOOoD Really excited to just really um Get down to the funky sound and just eat it on the same street that there's the Asian box There is also Brandy Melville and an Urban Outfitters So we might just have to pop in there and see what we can find, okay, bitch You just cut me off hoe, and I'm not happy about it. Okay. I'll see you guys when I get food So we're gonna do a haul I only bought stuff from Brandy cuz I'm just lazy I got two belts first one is Like this I saw it on that mannequin and I was like Thats kind of sick But basically you like wrap it around your waist And then like go like this and then like part of it hangs down, and it looks a little bit edgy So we'll see if I can pull that off. And then kind of dirty. That sucks, okay It's this black like buckle belt like this Just because I think that these are really good style of belt, and they are really handy and #Cute. So Yeah! That was my haul. I think it might be getting a little bit sick. Don't tell my mom Cuz then she'll make me take medicine, but like between you and me I'm thinking I'm getting a little bit sick, so I'm gonna go home and rest and that's it for today's vlog I originally thought I could end the vlog there and like we'd be fine, but I was wrong and soooo We had to continue it on to the next day because I didn't have enough footage you know how it is sometimes *gasps for air* So I thought we'd do a little bit nighttime hangout time a little nighttime Hangout time we're gonna be making myself a little La croix in your probably like Emma. What do you mean make it? Let me explain. This is my Lacroix recipe First we take a pure flavoured Lacroix. Aka. Just sparkling water. You could literally get any sort of sparkling water and it would taste the same, but whatever Good we're gonna take two of these true lime packets. They're basically like lime flavouring It's easier than like buying fresh limes at the store and you can literally put two in and it tastes like you put like a whole lime In there, which is like really nice cuz I like my stuff sour just like my heart, so Funny joke so funny. It's like a little powder fuck oh Ow fuck What's up, so we're at my desk got a water got a face mask We're gonna really um #pamper ourselves tonight, so buckle your seatbelts people let's just jump right into it *AHhHHHhhH* first order of business, you know how earlier in the video I showed you guys some of the songs I actually have a few more so listen up Good this is the next one this is like my favorite song right now, just saying I'm literally so ready to take this face mask off. Okay, actually. I need your guys's help if You don't want to give me your opinion then just click onto this video pussy But if you want to stay on and help me with my life and be like you know Helpful stay tuned, but if not then click off Okay, so anyway for all you guys who are still here I need help choosing what I should do with my nails next what color should I do let me know down below I'm taking this off I know it's not time to take it off yet, but I just like don't want to be wearing it anymore So it's almost spring when's spring? What the fuck when does it turn spring When does spring start spring begins Tuesday, okay like Why was that so complex for me, so yeah, so spring starts Tuesday? I don't know what to do with that information like now that we have it But I mean I guess that's fun. Cuz then that means like winter is over. It's time for some new beginnings Guess that was it for today's video. I don't know Goodnight."

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-03-16T03:51:02Z,168213,4417302,6575,"AAAAA, YAH-HAH-HOooh... yehhh. Okay, I- immediately... UMM kinda thirsty... *sigh* eh. What's up guys? It's Emma, welcome back That felt weird. Anyways *phone dings* shut the Frick! up >:( I'm literally so annoyed right now Hi! So what's up guys. It's Emma. You know me, you probably don't like me that much but you probably like me a little bit, cause that's why you're here. I'm pretty excited for today's video I mean I'm excited for every video, right? I mean, right. We're always excited here in this family, but especially this one because today we're eating big and- no pun intended *WHEEZE* *Chuckling* blink This video is gonna be pretty extreme. I mean, like, not gonna lie, might get like 1 billion views. Gundam [sic] style move out of the f*cking way, baby cause this video is gonna be f*cking crazy. So as you guys know I have kind of an obsession with whisks. It all started with the mini whisk *pause* hold on. Mini whisk! Right? You know, one day I used her and she was just something else and stole my heart. <3 Of course I also have a regular whisk, but we don't really give a f*ck about her, uh-huh-hmm... Anyways. Well then somebody had the nerve to send this to my PO box- hold on - this bitch, right? I mean she doesn't do anything- at all, but she's cute though, right? Okay well, then I was sent this whisk. Yeah, it gets smaller! Like, who would have thought? I mean you guys I don't know where you're, like, whisk dealer is, but you guys got all the goods. And then when you thought it couldn't get any better -  look at this. I was also sent an even smaller whisk keychain. The moral of the story is: you guys know I love whisks. You guys have been gifting me with these whisks for the past, you know, few months. Well, then one day I'm at the PO box and um, I get a box. (Yeah, no shit! *booing*) And this box is huge. The size of me. I mean, I'm not that tall but like it's still pretty big, for like a box. And I was like, wow, what could be in there? I shake the box. Hmm, something's rattling, like: ""this is weird, like what could this be?"" I opened it up and my life changed forever. I was sent this *Applause* Yeah. *coffee music* Ever since I was sent this whisk, I knew that I needed to do something, and it needed to be big. Then it dawned on me: big whisk = big food. Yeah, bitch That's what we're doing today. Today, we're gonna be making the biggest cookie that America has ever seen, and I'm pretty excited about it. I don't know. Umm, I like it big? *jeering and booing* *exit* So here's my game plan- (airbending) Actually, do you know what? You're just gonna follow along. For the type of cookie that we're making today, we're gonna be making Chocolate Chunk cookies, because they're superior to the rest of the cookies and not only all of that, but these cookies are vegan so for all my vegan thots out there: I gotchu ;) And for all the girls who are going to Coachella: these cookies are very healthy and will most likely fit into your very restrictive and mentally draining diet <3 this really works for everyone - heh Good! Alright, while I'm doing this, you know, cause this part's not interesting, I'm just like putting all the ingredients together and whatnot, so let me tell you a story. Right? Sounds good? No? Well, you're gonna hear it anyway, so... I kinda missed that. Cute! This is just something that happened to me today and I just wanted to share. Also, this outfit, like these leggings with this top doesn't match at all but you weren't supposed to see the bottom half of my body, and now that you did, it's like awkward. Sorry! Anyways, a little while ago, I tweeted that I saw some beautiful creature of a man- well, actually, a boy I mean he's like my age, but- at Whole Foods or that's the location I said on Twitter because I didn't want to actually say where I saw him just in case for some reason he saw the tweet somehow, which he would never see the tweet, but like just in case he did like- like- I- I- just I- I- I would die! *struggling* Sorry One of those things where it's like: you see him, and then you're like: ""wow he's so beautiful!"" Then you're like: ""welp, never gonna see him again."" Well, guess what? I f*cking saw him again today. I saw him again! He's- okay, I'm sorry, my luck is bad. Every day I have bad luck, the universe is testing me at all times, so the fact that I saw him twice- by the way, this is palm shortening I don't know what that is, and I like don't want to know, but I just thought I'd let you know because it probably looks concerning and I just wanted to kind of run it by you guys to see what you thought- but anyway, back to the story: I couldn't believe that I saw him again. We walked right by each other, made eye contact, and it was magical for only me, not for him. He's probably like: ""this bitch is ugly,"" but I- I loved it though, but I didn't say anything to him! I look back at this and I'm like: ""Emma you are so stupid."" But then again, if you think about it, like what would I have said? ""Hey, heh-heh."" Like what the f*ck? You know I mean? And the thing is: he could be a total asshole. What if he's like a total dick? What if he cheats on his girlfriends? Like, we don't know! When you just look at someone, you don't know what they're like! This guy could be literally Satan himself and I would have no clue because all I know about him is that I looked at him and that he's really tan, blonde, my type, my dream man! Really, umm, *awkward laugh* *bass boost noise* But yeah, so if you know who you are... slide into the dm's! *tap* And also, to make matters worse, no one believes me, I tweeted about it again, some people were like: ""umm, pics or it didn't happen."" BITCH you think I'm gonna take a picture of this hoe?? Sorry I'm probably being really loud. My neighbors probably don't want to hear about my life stuff. :,( But also, I saw him, and my hair is like this. This is what my hair looked like when I saw him. You know what I mean? What a first impression! I really f*cked it up for myself. Whatever, you guys don't care. This is like really weird ingredients, because it's like really vegan. I like to be inclusive to all, so I like to make my recipes that I make vegan. Hate on me if you want, but Freelee won't be hating on me, that's for damn sure. 8^O No, what the f*ck? Why does that shit happen to me? It's like- it's rude It really is, and I don't deserve it at all. I am so nice to everyone. Well, not everyone *sip* D:< *clang* Ow! So, St. Patty's Day... coming up! *awkward laugh* I literally could not give less f*cks about St. Patrick's Day and do you know what? To all you Irish people out there who are about to get offended: I'm Irish too so shut the f*ck up I've also been to Ireland, so shut the fuck up x2, I don't care about St. Patty's! It's not a fun holiday, there's no point! Actually, there probably is a point, I just don't know what it is cause I'm an uncultured swine. This is so fucking fun. Why is this low-key like effective? Like it's actually good at mixing. ♪ I hope you understand ♪ Honestly, I kind of sound like Britney right there. ♪ ...understand. ♪ D'you know what? F*ck this, I'm sick of it Kinda worked honestly, but I'm sick of it, it's making my arm tired. So guess what we're gonna bring out? Take a hot look at this. ;) Someone else sent me, in my PO box, a fucking hand mixer because y'all know that my arms are weak as f*ck and so you sent me a hand mixer so that I would be able to- oh wait, shit now I have to wash it. That's annoying y'all sent me a hand mixer- y'all- never said that my life, don't ever want to say it again. Y'all. Why do I- It's tempting, I can't stop. You guys sent me a hand mixer because you knew that I needed it. I don't want to have to wash that so I'm gonna use a different hand mixer, because guess what? I wasn't just sent one hand mixer, I was sent two. A hand mixer that requires no electricity so that if I ever needed to mix stuff when there's no electricity I would have this and I just want to say: shoutout to you! It's like Christmas every day with you guys being my Santa. I love you <3 *awkward laugh* I wanna die, a little bit I'm gonna use this one because it'll be easier to wash. You know what I mean? I have to think about myself sometimes. Look at this bad boy. Just washed it. Let's get right into this. *fumbles* Ugh (PBFT) Ew! That looks like literal taco meat. Holy shit, that does look like taco meat. I'm vegetarian, I wouldn't know actually, anyways. *moist noises* I hate this It's difficult! *aggressive mashing* *bass boost noise* Okay... I'm don't even wanna look. I'm f*cking tired. If these cookies don't turn out well, and I put this much manual labor into it I'm gonna be so f*cking pissed. Why does this look like chicken? This is supposed to be vegan. I think I've said that exact same phrase in another video. I can't remember, but I feel like I did *X-Files theme* Sorry that I literally have only like ten jokes, and I just like regurgitate them. That's something that you signed up for, I didn't tell you to do that. ♪ Get crazy, get wild, let's party, get loud, if you wanna have fun and do some- ♪ If you didn't watch Jersey Shore you won't get that reference and honestly, you don't deserve to get the reference if you didn't watch Jersey Shore, because Jersey Shore was genuinely the best show and, I don't know. People who didn't watch it just... didn't have a childhood I was literally 12, and I would just watch the people on Jersey Shore have sex I think it's funny that like some people maybe, potentially, clicked on this video expecting like, instruction on how to make cookies. Like, that would be so funny. *pfft* Because I would never do that. Where's the salt? Goddamnit. Where the fuck is it though, honestly? I literally just had it, like I don't know where it went, I literally don't understand. *crying* *thud* Are you f*cking- it's thi- it's- okay. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ *cheering* *all-star smile* Hi, heh-heh Stop staring at me >:( I love how messy I make the kitchen, and then make my mom clean it up It's so cute, how I do that. Okay, this is low-key working really well *works less well* Mmmkay, well. I need an apron. Why don't I have an apron? That's so weird. You're not supposed to use this whisk like this, but I clearly don't give a fochk *gross* Okay (thud) yeah *unintelligible* We bring out the big guns, you know what I'm saying? Let's get into it YESSS ♪ Fergalicious plays ♪ Yeah, this works- not good *hits cabinet, says ow?* What the f*ck? I'm like breaking my house. You're welcome, mom, I know you love me! Oh- oh no! I just broke my cabinet! Oh no! There goes my fridge! *chuckle, demonic background noise* Okay, I'm done with that *censored* That's so sexual. So guys. What's been up? You know, me and you, we haven't talked in a while and I just kinda want to know what's up? Like, has your crush been talking to you at school, is your best friend being a bitch? She's probably being a bitch. Did you get an A on your test? Did your teacher...? I don't go to school. Okay, I don't know what kind of paper to use. (use parchment, not wax) I haven't even washed my hands yet, and I already made the whole thing. Germs will die in the oven because they can't survive that heat. Am I right, ladies and gents? *awkward laugh* That's a fake fact. I'm washing my hands, mom. I know you're watching. PBFT x3 Now things get kind of weird *more fart noises* This is a f*cking nightmare. Holy shit Eghhh ♪ sad music ♪ ♪ Crazy Frog - We Like to Party ♪ This is our baby. She's f*cking huge, and I'll see you in eight to ten minutes. Goodbye! OOOOOH Holy shit Oh my God! Look at this. *weird noise* x3 Look at this bitch. Look at her! *Aww!* Let's slice into this bad bitch. Hmm, she feels a little bit liquidy, but we'll work with it. Okayyy. Yeah... so we've taken out a little slice. Um, let's just see how it tastes. I mean, it's not bad *outro*"

Last time I tried to vlog on the plane I got laughed at so hoping that that doesn't happen again. We have a very exciting day today You know i'm being stared at so that's always good, but we're flying to Austin, Texas with the brand Dote. It's not  sponsored They just invited me on the trip, and I was like f*ck yeah We'll talk more later, but that's all you get to know for now because my mom said I'm being too loud (music) ""Lately and I've been so alone"" ""and a smile from you might make me a fool"" ""and a smile from you might make me a fool"" All right, so just landed in Texas.

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-03-02T02:10:10Z,227071,6013756,13412,"Let's get funky here Hey guys, it's the video that you've all been waiting for haha oh Yeah Alright, what's up, guys? It's Emma. You know - you know the drill um... How are you guys? hope you're doing really good you guys have been requesting that I do a fortnite video and Originally, I was just like no like I'm not gonna do a fortnite video like yes I play fortnite sometimes, and I like hashtag kill it *honk honk* BUT I was like there's no way I'm ever gonna do a gaming video like who do you think I am? well here I am *demonic laughter* I don't know. I just thought it could be kind of fun to show off my skills Maybe show you guys how you guys can improve your own gameplay Take some tips from me. I'm pretty good, but *huh* If you don't play fortnite, it's basically this game that's taking over everyone's lives. It's not actually taking over my life that much because I'm just like so good that it doesn't really challenge me So I'm like eh like whatever like it's like whatever. I'm not that hooked because it's like I'm not that good *booing* I know too real Looks like I'm waiting in line whatever the fuck that means, like what does that mean? Like I have to wait three minutes until we can start playing? What the fuck is that? Not happy about that. While we wait should we make a coffee? What do you think?Yep. I think yes. Let's go we have three minutes to go make this coffee, let's make it spiffy people! *heavy breathing* *glasses clink *ice rattles* AAAAAAaaa *awkwardly whips* *we like to party comes on* Like i'm making a fortnite video today. Did you guys expect me to dress up????? if you did you came to the wrong channel? swish swish *makes coffee* *jumping commences* *'we like to party' comes on* *screams* *makes other animal noises* I'm glad the wait time was three minutes gave me time to make it coffee because when you're playing fortnight you actually like need or when you're playing any games in general or editing or doing anything on your computer you have to have a Nice drink to keep you refreshed because you're gonna be a little bit in Distress in some way probably and so you're gonna need something to help you know calm your nerves did that make any sense? I don't really care And success Glad that we did that together Let's get right into this baby, and we keep the mom and I'm kind of excited I mean like not really but like kind of all right guys squat up where we jump in We're gonna start out with tilted towers. If you don't play fortnight, then you wouldn't know but tilted  towers is intense tilted towers It's crazy. It's a place that all the pros jump, and as you guys know I'm a pro 3 so when we jump in a Tilted towers look at all these fuckin people. I'm gonna die very quickly just kidding I'm gonna die very slowly because I am a good at fortnite, so anyways actually should I not land here. You know, fuck it. I'm not gonna land here actually wait. It's too late. Oh shit. Okay, okay, shit. Oh. Oh shit. Nope shit. Why am I so? I'm good at this. I have a lot of coordination I get very Intimidated by tilted towers because it's the place where all the people land, so like I just am NOT ready for that right now What's let's just we'll go back later We'll go back later and for now we'll do someone just gonna chill in the surrounding areas cuz I just don't think I can deal With that let's go inside of this little place. Let's see if there's anything in here for us anything Okay, there's nothing in here good. Let's keep going then fuck that. Okay. What is this damage trap? I still to this day? Don't really know what that does, but I'm still gonna pick it up. See what's in here Oh, fuck yeah, some ammo so I can shoot up them bitches Even though I don't even have a gun yet still need to find a gun for all you guys who play fortnite You know everybody like experienced whatever you know that the first step to any good game is to find a gun you got to find A gun cuz he can't kill anyone with the pickaxe you got going here, and oh shit. Yeah, buddy see what I see Okay, now at least I have a gun so I can kind of be prepared if somebody like comes and tries to gratata me Oh, there's another gun didn't even almost see it. What the hell Oh, shit, is that what I think it is oh no what I can't do this. Okay know what that what I think it is Let me get in here. Yeah, I found a special treasure chest Thinking I might just want to chill out here for a sec. Let's kind of just lay on the bed We're just chilling in bed I'm just gonna sit right here and wait for someone to come around that I can shoot There are some people over there, but they're not very close pick pick. Oh shit Mm-hmm kill them Shit, no they kil- WHAT THE FUCK UUUUUUUH Are you kidding? I was doing so good like I literally was like you saw me. I was just shooting at it We're playing again this run were gonna dominate all right were gonna dominate I'm gonna stop. I don't want to go to tilted towers again. We had a bad experience. I'm thinking retail row. target acquired Now its time to jump. jumping in three two one all right, and we're on our way. It's a success I can't wait to just kill it I don't know if I don't feel like a lot of people go to retail row or a lot of people like land here. I see a gun spotted ding ding, pow is someone in here is someone fucking in here? What the fuck?. Well. No I'm Nick. I'm dying I'm gonna die right now. I'm literally gonna die right now I Literally just died so fast. I was just like not ready like I wasn't ready and like I literally like I place 86 I'm better than this I swear like this is not normal. We're playing again. I'm sorry uh I'm like annoyed and that guy was standing right there like I could have killed him. I just like I froze fuck How was that let me know okay, honestly I need to strategize this game because I'm like sick of being I'm sick of dying so quickly Whoever's dancing needs to shut the fuck up looking on the map. Let's see where we gonna go. Should we go to Lonely Lodge? Honestly, what a fat mood. You know what I mean or wailing woods. No one ever goes there No, no, or should we gotta tilted. No no. Let's go to salty spings, SALTY SPRINGS That's where we're going three two go. I don't see I see a little guy am I going to the right place I don't really care anymore at this point. How do I already hear gunshots like I haven't even landed yet? God damn it. Why do I have a feeling? I'm gonna die very quickly this run mmm. I get gun. So I can defend myself against the enemies. oh shit. ammo no gun though, is that a- no. There's not gonna be gun in here This is only ammo, but like who even uses the Rockets no one not me anyways only stupid people Smh, Oh is someone behind me someone down there. shit Know what they can't know that shit I Am so mad at this game! This is just embarrassing now at first It was like funny, and I was like not funny because it's like I'm literally like doing so bad honestly This is karma for me gassing myself up earlier. I suck at fucking fortnite, okay This is gonna be the one I need to strategize. I need to get better I need to prepare myself What's up, squad? All right? You guys ready? Hey guys ready for a big game All right, fuck you guys all right guys just about for tonight where we jump is not Funny do you wanna fuck? I don't even care. I'm just gonna jump in a random time We're jumping now, and we're just gonna go. I'm not even gonna strategize actually, maybe that's the way to win all right I'm kind of thinking on this little house thing right here. Maybe are you guys feeling about that well land right here? How you guys feeling about that don't even care cuz guess what's not up to you? It's up to me cuz I am the fortnight Queen just kidding I already decided that I got bad karma for talking myself up um, so we're not gonna do that alright? I already found a gun off to a good start Is it a good gun of course it isn't cuz that's not how my luck is we're just gonna camp out We're just gonna camp out. Oh wait no I can't camp out cuz as you can see I'm not inside of the circle You got to get inside of the circle if there's that little line right there? Then that means that you're not on thread of the circle and you gotta get inside the circle so For all you guys who are uneducated. I'm teaching you a little something new about fortnight for all you uneducated hoes sometimes I just like to swing while I'm running I mean it doesn't really help It's just kind of fun kind of empowers me You know she's probably like carrying around a gun just oh shit unnecessary did not need to do that But it kind of felt good alright. We're inside the circle now good glad. We're here Let's start cutting down some trees just for shits and giggles not gonna. Lie just for some shits just for some gigs Why not this one too I? Have a feeling I'm gonna die soon though under PewDiePie place for a night. Let me know down below does PewDiePie I love pewdiepie honestly. I kind of wish I was him sometimes. Well. I mean I'm just gonna stop. I hear it Oh there. It is we found a mystery box things I don't know a buncha gifts in it that literally looks like a Thai pod Do you know what time pods are over and not funny if you make jokes about Tide Pods still you're the worst? Bye, we're just gonna chill in here and wait and see if I can shoot someone I'm feeling kind of crazy like that anyone around. I'm trying to gratata these badges I'm so sorry. There's literally no one around, but hey. We're doing better than last time look How do you vote thirty-eight if I die right now? I bought 38th place and that's a lot better than my past rankings so kind of proud of myself not gonna lie right now But no one's around anyone around oh shit Should I leave this area I mean like I've been sitting here for like a solid two minutes and like nothing's happening We're just gonna run around and see what we can find I might die soon like I just kind of have like an inkling cuz I'm kind of out in the open right now Which is like stupid of me, but I like taking risks I mean like I'm good enough where I can like take risks and like still lives that looks like a dope gun Let's replace one of my old guns with it yeah that gun looks sick shit. There's a person. There's a person What the fuck why is my game frozen shit? So it's the next day as you guys know yesterday. I was not on my a-game. Simple as that not on my a-game We're not always gonna have good days. I was getting completely destroyed every single time, and that's not like me it Just felt weird so I went to bed and I woke up and now we're here again And we're connect we're gonna try again. Um if I seem like I'm in kind of a bad mood It's because I went to Whole Foods to pick up some almond milk for my mom and then when I got home She was like that's the wrong almond milk, and I was like it's not that fucking sucks So then I had to go back and then now here We are and it was a drag alright where we jump in fam well yesterday. I was kind of goofing around I'm like let's go to tilted towers then no do you want today we're gonna dominate And we're not gonna lane until two towers because every time I've ever landed there. I've died within like the first 20 seconds We're landing somewhere that we know that we can dominate. I'm thinking we're gonna go to Salty springs, but so fucking glitchy like look how bad that looks let's see. Where are we going here? Am I thinking? I want to go to this house. Oh shit. I hear a mystery box hear that sound mystery box. Let's find it It's above me. Oh wait. Oh, it's a little pleasant ok wait. Where is it there it is there? Is that mystery box just waiting there for me to just open it up? You have a lot of goodies very proud to be here ok. I think we're good. I kind of don't know what to do What should I do? I don't really know like what to do now? I have some guns like should I just chill how risky do I want to be you know what I mean shit shit shit Someone's coming someone's coming. I hear them. I literally hear you hear those steps where the fuck are they? You guys heard those God down steps there anyone out there. I don't see anyone anywhere I want to shoot someone hide what if I just get victory royale on this one? What if I just win like what if I just like win this round cuz I'd be awesome I love that. I don't hear anyone should I like run around that's so risky like I'll get killed You know I'm in the circle as you can see I'm doing great I'm honestly fine thriving right now not trying to flex, but like I mean I don't have that many guns But like whatever. I just want to shoot someone and show off my shooting skills I'm kind of scared like I don't know why I normally don't feel scared while I'm playing but like today I kind of feel scared it's okay. I'm how you got this don't there's no need to be scared you're right Emma You're fine, and you're chilling. Let's go in here I need to get more guns and stuff because I need to be prepared just in case somebody grace to hoot me mettle great That's not gonna. Help me. I feel like I'm in danger. Oh shit shit shit shit. I Saw people over here. There's people over there. You see that see those peoples. They're building something. What are you building over there pussy? Well, I don't really know what to do in this situation. I'm not gonna waste my ammo on them You know what I mean. They don't deserve that shit. I need to get some shelter I'm gonna go over here go quick Emma. Come on. Don't get shot at you stupid bitch. Sorry I'm yelling at myself not at others. There's some ammo though. That's good. I need to hide. You know I can't be so crazy I'm being so crazy right now. I need to be less crazy, and I need to be more conservative Sorry, if you hear my text messages coming in I'm just really popular so and no they're not from my mom Thanks for asking. Oh shit. Let's go in here. This could be good I mean, that's a shitty ass gun and I would know cuz I know a lot about for tonight Okay, bought it inside the circle. You know the drill guys don't ever you Don't know they gotta be stealth gotta be stealth because gotta get inside the circle without getting murdered. You know what I mean It's like it's not easy, and it's not gonna be easy It's never been easy nobody ever said for tonight was easy except for me because it is easy Definitely a little bit anxious not gonna lie a little bit anxious, but hey, it's just a game. It's just a game I didn't why did I do that? Why did I do that? I did not mean to do that that was just unnecessary completely like someone has their eyes on me What if I want like okay? I know it's a little bit crazy I know it's a little bit steep But like what if I dip genuinely did like how fuckin wild would that be might just look around and chill in here Holy shit. There are 17 people left. I'm kind of doing good You guys know I wasn't really doing so good like in the beginning so top 17 like whatever I mean I don't like 100 like oh shit. I see if you oh, they're over there. They're building a house I'm not gonna shoot at him, but I just I'm glad I know that they're there you know what I mean. It's just good It's just good to know I'm getting scared and I'm getting worried. I am so fucking scared. Holy shit Why am I scared like? This is so stupid why am I scared? It's just for tonight, and I'm on but I'm genuinely like afraid for my life I think I'm afraid because I'm kind of doing good, and I don't want to fight it up like there's 14 people left Which means I'm like getting kind of close like I'm kind of killing it like not gonna Lie like kind of killing it right now Why is my game frozen right now bad time to be frozen you stupid bitch shit. I hear someone shooting I hear someone shooting. I need to be careful. I really do someone is definitely shooting at me where the fuck are you bitch? Shit, where you at? You hear that I'm going in here. I'm just gonna chill in here and wait for somebody to test me basically. It's okay It's just a game Emma instead of a game It's not even real, but there's eight people left and like I'm kind of killing it, so I'm like sweating like look I'm literally red a little bit Some crazy stuff is happening outside, but I'm ready. They won't even fuck me Yeah, right bitch shit shit shit I gotta go I gotta go Okay, I'm probably gonna die like right now shit. I'm gonna die so soon. I know it I I oughta stand a chance right now But like I'm just gonna kind of go for it and like hope for the best I guess but I really don't stand a chance I am so stressed out like why do I have to be doing so well right now? There's five fucking people left like why am I killing it right now. Why am I doing, so good? There's someone in there? Is this even like worth my time, I don't know I Hate this game, why are there four people left why am I doing good? And I died I got fourth place out of 100 which is like pretty good. I mean like I'm pretty proud of me What an emotional roller goes there? Oh my computer smells like it's burning probably because I'm enough for tonight's bad for it I don't know one more round for the for the cool kids for the cool kids. What does that? Even mean kind of want to land like on top of one of these big things I don't know I've never done that before but I feel like see like there's like this like her know like house like on still it's like what? Happens if I land on it.

I ain't kidding I'll give you a quick little recap. We basically just went out, and we got some ramen which was actually really good I've never had ramen before but it was so good and um *siri talks* You can turn that shit down if you want. No. It's still gonna cut me off. I got the vegan ramen *siri talks* No, don't fucking laugh. It's not funny. I'm literally so irritable right now. Yeah, that's what happens you have like nine minutes of sleep Yeah, okay, I like I'm gonna try to talk really fast before Siri cuts me off again, so basically when we got ramen And then we hung out with some fun peo- *siri talks* So then we hung out with Wait... Am i going north Oh my god, I just, I just want to talk If I can get the sentence out, it's gonna be a miracle I literally don't think it's actually physically possible for me to get out a full sentence We hung out with Josh and Lucas and Casey I didn't vlog, but Josh vlogged, so I'll link his channel down below You can go subscribe and you'll see the vlog And so then you'll see what we were doing to make a long fucking story short I put a whole bag of jellybeans up my ass. I got home at like 5:00 a.m.. Yesterday morning. I woke up at 3 a.m. And then I like didn't sleep at all for like 24 hours, and then went to bed at 5 a.m.   And then slept for like 4 hours does this make sense and all my doing. Yes pretty close, yeah I mean that's how you got to do it when you're in LA right. Okay? I'm cutting that out thats so cringy I don't do that much social stuff in my life, so I was really proud of me for really branching out So I'm not gonna put that in either because that's too real you know so right now.

We're gonna be recording a podcast I'm just like, I'm really literally running on no sleep And I haven't had any caffeine yet today or anything my body is like failing, my body is like actually like shutting down At like an alarming rate like my body's like, slowly deteriorating *siri talks* My body is like lowly its slowly melting and I like feel it.

No don't you'll your body will fail your Creegan body will literally collapse your lungs Me and Jarrod already put enough garbage in our body. That's like oh, I guess I got to do this again My favorite song Hi, I've literally been the worst vlogger of Potentially all-time this trip. I just want to tell you that I'm sorry ow ow ow what the fuck I got my finger is stuck sorry To give you some context as to why I haven't been vlogging it's because Every time that I'm not doing something interesting and or vlogging I'm literally sleeping insert picture of me sleeping on the floor in the podcast Studio thing this is like the first day that I've not really had anything planned sort of so today We're going to Melrose because I want to go shopping and spend all my god marriage on Siculus I want to spend all my goddamn money Then my dad is now forcing me to go to some stupid museum that I'm probably gonna end up liking once I get there It's just that whenever somebody's like go to a museum. I'm like shut the fuck up I don't want to go to a museum, and then I end up going in and I'm like this is actually really cool And I'm like glad that I went I'm feeling it definitely a little bit irritable So if I seem like kind of a hashtag biatch, that's why I feel good as long as I've got a full belly I'm I'm happy. I don't care. So you're telling me we have to get food?. Yeah well i'm happy i don't care I'm sure there's plenty of good food there. Yeah, that's all it's all about him these days. No I'm just kidding I want to get food too. See i have to say I have to say just kidding because I feel like people are gonna be like Emma has Changed. No. I've been with her for a couple days, and she's totally transformed. I'm now a bitch hi This is just how I am when I'm tired you guys don't see me like this. This is not pretty. I know well Ooh i'm popular. I feel like my SD card's gonna run out of space, but I brought another one. Nice You're prepared. Yeah. I'm a good Youtuber mmm. I love LA. I just feel like I have a lot here No
Do you know why I'm moving to LA and I'm gonna move into the Disneyland castle and I'm gonna live on the top floor And I'm never gonna leave Disneyland for breakfast churros lunch Mac and cheese, I don't know No one gets popcorn there oh my god Okay comment down below if you've been to Disneyland and like you somehow got blessed enough to stay in the frickin grand California hotel I literally don't even think I've ever stayed there except for when Someone else brought me there with them because my parents would just never figure that out you guys just wouldn't you know very, California? Oh hell, no exactly my parents are like we are not staying in the freaking disneyland hotel that's like nine hundred dollars a night fuck that but one time I got to eat breakfast there because I just got really lucky and I had place you got attacked by that big chipmunk Let's not talk about it. I got to eat breakfast at the Grand, California They have like waffles that are shaped like Mickey Mouse very awesome taste is mediocre But the shape it just makes up for it. Also. I had like fruit and stuff What was the fruit of course it was a melon combo watermelon cantaloupe honeydew sometimes pineapple which is not a melon? But it always ends up in there, and there's always like three of them And they always end up tasting not even like pineapple anymore they just taste like cantaloupe the entire melon medley does always just taste like cantaloupe because cantaloupe with such a dominant flavor And it just makes everything taste like cantaloupe that it touches you think that you're eating like honeydew, then when you take a bite It's actually taste like cantaloupe because the cantaloupe juice rubbed all over it, but the funny thing is I don't even eat honeydew *siri talks* Yeah, I don't like honeydew because it tastes like frickin water. You know how actually, you just haven't had a good honeydew Because they don't all taste like that Okay that's stupid because also I think that you know the guy that like interviews all the SoundCloud rappers. No jumper or something I think they have stores on Melrose and so maybe I'll get to see a little pump to be determined... Take a hot look at this shit it says coffee for sasquatch right there You can't really see because the coffee is kind of blurred out But as you know I am a very big fan of sasquatch myself And I think that I had a such an iconic name that I don't even care if the coffee is shitty I just want to check it out. You can tell if coffee is gonna be good based on like this based on the aesthetic Sorry, I feel like you can tell if a coffee shops gonna be good if they have like neon signs like the neon like signs I'll insert something right here so that you know what I'm talking about if they have a neon sign like this you know It's gonna be good coffee *Cheerful music plays* You got that right *Cheerful music plays* Ohhhh my god We don't normally flex like this, but this is vegan too so don't can roast me in the comments I don't want to frickin hear it *Cheerful music plays* Lets do a little taste test *Cheerful music plays* That donut was so f***ing good I can't believe is real Oh my god, that's so true alright, we go into this place because I don't know every time I see some sort of thrift  style store. I'm going in I don't care if it looks bad. I don't care if it looks good. That's just how I be ok Yeah, so far so bad That was not what I was looking for they had some supreme stuff at the front, but it didn't look real And that's how you know that you have to leave even though I know I don't own anything from supreme, so I don't know what's real and what's fake, but it looks kind of fake But how am I supposed to know because I don't own anything like that because guess what I'm not a hype beast I don't roll like that, but if you want to send me anything supreme in my p.o. Box my p.o Box is open I will leave the link down below if you want to send me some supreme but besides that that's all I got let's see what We can find This isn't actually that expensive so far same so we can bury 120 bucks never mind everything was like two hundred dollars, so that was canceled, but now we're going in here Alright guys kind of feel a little quirky in these let me know yes or no comment down below There's like so much cool stuff that I actually can't look at it off and like try everything on that I love and so I'm just like looking and just like I'm emotionally I'm completely distraught overwhelmed yes And you know what because of that feeling I'm to buy these and if you think that they're ugly. I don't get the break I Don't care. What you think I just bought these hoes kind of sad I've been going to all these cool places and now I'm going to Urban Outfitters But I just can't help my addiction so here. We are really not proud of me, but here we are you know? A little pump if you're in there, I just want to let you know. I'm just like really proud of you I know we haven't seen each other in a while, but I hope you've been good miss you so much I know that you we are in I'm overheating See you always see me looking at jeans you never see me buying jeans why On jeans why are you turning it off? I know you guys always make fun of me because I always buy collared shirts But I don't care. This is 16 bucks tucked into some jeans Okay this Lighting's Stupid just finished on Melrose. It was definitely really dope I'm definitely a fan. I would definitely shop here again Literally so many good thrift stores. They're not that sort of like vintage like resale shops. I don't know probably shouldn't go shopping Where's your water or whatever I guess we'll just see you at the Museum Which I just don't want to go to but she's gonna say. She's saying right now. I don't want to go It's not gonna be fun. Let's see what happens once I get older I'll be able to enjoy things like wine and in museums in museums even though I cherry enjoy wine but not museums so update we drove like an hour to get to the museum And then it was closed because there's a power outage. Hey guys What's up, so you know? How I told you guys earlier that I was gonna do a haul once. I got home You know mm-hmm cancelled not gonna happen I'm gonna do one when I get home from this trip because I'm leaving tomorrow morning So let's do and when I get home, so don't worry about it. You know also I've got some other stuff like recently that I want to include, too So it'll just be like a big fun haul and I can't wait, but you're gonna see that in like one second But I'm gonna film it in like 24 hours, so anyways crazy hug life happens this trip I just ruined my body I feel so horrible my head hurts. I am dehydrated. I haven't exercised in so long I am just a mess, but I'm doing great. You know it's okay. Just kidding. See you when I get home It's gonna be so crazy. I'm gonna cover the camera and then when I take my hand away I'm gonna be home where's for me. I still have to pack my bags I still have to fly on a plane all the way home I still have to wake up early like I have so much shit that I have to do But you aren't even gonna see any of that I'm gonna cover the camera, and I'm gonna take my hand away And I'mma be home, I'm gonna have showered I'm gonna have unpacked my bags and I'm gonna be settled back into my house For you it's gonna be one second but for me it's gonna be a CrAzY jOuRnEy It's crazy. FuCk dude. SHIT Fuck, no that like, fucks with me. Like, I wish that I was you right now. I wish that it was that easy. You know what, I'm too tired for this Shit. Go listen to Oprah or something if you want something inspirational and insightful. DON'T COME TO MY CHANNEL FOR THAT Let's activate this magic It's hall time baby, it's hall time *shushes the screen* *Twinkly music plays* Wwwww... I'm home now. I don't normally do halls, so this is a little bit weird but I kinda feel like I got some cool stuff lately I'm not gonna do it like a normal hall. Instead of like holding stuff up and being like ThIs iS WhAt i GoT hehe I'm just gonna show me wearing the clothes instead of talking about it cause no one cares. I'm just gonna show you me wearing it and then I'll have the store name in one of the corners. That's gonna be it. I just feel like, no one cares about me talking about the clothes. You just wanna see the clothes. That's how I feel anyways. And I'll link almost all of them down below, this is about as beauty guru as it gets for me...so don't get too used to this cause it's not gonna happen again sO *sharp inhale* Yeah. I guess that's it. But let me tell you the stores these things are from um number 1, all the thrift stores on Melrose. number 2, some stuff from Urban Outfitters and number 3, some stuff from Rom-way...or Romwe it's spelt like this, I don't know, Romwe, I don't #$@* care Enjoy, that's it. Let's get into it! Ow #$*@ Let's get into it!

- of course, we made it to the gate this is just, it never gets easy. i'm being judged so i need to get good at this, like casey neistat is never like, oh i'm uncomfortable when he's in the airport vlogging his, like $20,000 flights you know what i mean, well that he gets for free. all right guys in the airport just chilling just chilling. should i like edit or should i just like, give up oh i don't wanna go about to board the plane, kind of tired, what the frick? flight attendant bags by calling 9-1-1.  dont care our flight, was delayed, by an hour because supposedly they filled the plane with too much fuel (am i being laughed at) too much fuel in the tank they put too much in they have philz on this plane. should i buy a snack? yes i should i ordered philz, a sparkling water with lime, and some vegan brownies and i am so excited right now six out of ten next we're trying this actually that's kinda gross three out of ten at most the brownie that's a tiny brownie good eight out of ten welcome to los angeles oh what's up guys? oh what's up? we just got our rental car, we're now in it and we're gonna drive and get some food because we're literally about to die i'm having extremely, bad heartburn, like probably some of the worst heartburn i've had in my life, and i'm pretty sad about it but i don't know, we're gonna get some vegan food because we're feeling like vegan queens am i right?absolutely we don't get to check into our air b&b until like 4:00 it's 10:00 a.m. still got a whole day of ahead of us how do you feel about that? feel, good  i'm definitely starting to lose my steam. i'm feeling a little bit tired, not gonna lie, but i'm gonna persevere and we're gonna get through this together. alright peace out jake paulers hehe. okay, what's up. i look bald right now, we have no clue where we are, like literally don't know where we are. i just yelped vegan burrito, clicked on the first thing i found and now we're here yeah, we really don't know anything about this area, we don't know where we are but hey? we want burritos and we're gonna do whatever we need to do to make that happen for us you know what i mean? its all part of the adventure exactly. the little mistake i made because, we all know i'm very flawed in so many ways but the place that i chose on yelp doesn't open until 11:00 a.m. it's 10:45 ish right now so that was a mistake but we're gonna just take some pictures while we wait around here cuz, it's actually kind of an interesting like area. it kind of like looks cool, so we're gonna take some pics around here and then once it's time to eat, we're gonna go get our burritos, and life is gonna be crazy and it's gonna be great what do you think? i think so so yeah. hehe this. this is a super cool like vintagey, like retro, i don't know what that is like a diner kind of looking thing and then that looks kind of cool let's take photos by this curb let's go! good. proud of us we are done taking photos. it was fun, it was short lived. while we were taking photos somebody yelled out of their car work it white girl. i hated it. now it's time to get a burritooo they don't have burritos here, which was my error. i don't know why i thought they had burritos, they don't but i got rice and beans instead and i ordered a salad. either way tho still really good right now we're yelping a coffee place we're gonna go get some coffee because i have to go upload my videoo soo we have to go to a cafe. i do it all for you ahah. so let's see there's a few options i don't know why im yelling, okay so anyways, we had some food and it was pretty good. they didn't have burritos sadly, as you know so i had to get so i had to get rice and beans instead now we're gonna go to a coffee place called, neon and it looks really cute, pretty excited i think i've seen it on instagram before, which is always a good sign gonna do that, gonna upload the video and then probably meet up with enya and drew so i don't know, we'll see well you'll just find out and so will i cuz i don't know what i'm doing, okay, bye two hours later and now we're at whole foods. don't ask me how it happened. also this isn't even a whole foods, it's a 365 by whole foods whatever the hell that is. i really love whole foods, so i'm pretty excited about this experience and i can't wait to experience the 365. it's gonna be great. it's gonna be eye opening so far this is pretty epic not gonna lie- never in my entire 16 years of living have i ever said the word ""epic"" seriously. i mean like for obvious reasons. in this video, i say it with no sarcasm in my voice just complete genuine use of the word ""epic"". and it worries me beyond belief. i am so scared about myself. what other words am i saying that i'm not aware that i'm saying? like, yeah i just happened to get the word ""epic"" on camera but like what other things am i saying? i have no clue, and that's what i'm scared about i'm sorry, back to the vlog i guess. back to the vlog i guess. i guess. i guess- oh my god la croix in bottle form? amazing. i've been in this whole foods 360 for about five minutes and i've now realized that it is whole foods on crack. it's ten times better it's huger, it has more stuff everything is more fresher. it's better and it's the best so if you have a whole foods 360 near you i'd say check it out oh my god i almost tripped. what's up?

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-02-18T21:51:15Z,333842,9686630,15324,"Hi if it looks like I was crying I I was so You guessed correctly Don't worry guys. I'm totally good. I'm just on my period you know how it is I am so excited for today's video for once I often am compared to a 12 year old boy Which is like respectable like it makes sense I mean There's a lot of kind of reasons why one might compare me to a 12 year old boy for example um Everything about me so as you guys probably know if you've been watching me for a while or if you don't and you're just taking A wild guess I don't really care about my appearance too much. I don't get my nails done I don't get my eyebrows done. I don't get facials I don't get my hair done very often my roots are always growing out. I wear sweats a lot I literally don't know how to wear makeup like I don't know how to put it on I'm not good at it, and when I do wear it. It looks like absolute ass, but at the end of the day It's like I really just love sweats, and that's how it's always gonna be but today I wanted to Change that I wanted to see if there's a way that I could make myself look a little bit more like kind of a normal 16 year old girl would I mean I have three orders of business number one? Getting my nails done number two getting my eyebrows done and number three getting my hair dyed Let me explain all of them my nails. Um they kind of are gross I mean like I wash my hands sometimes But like they still manage to get dirty next order of business Getting my eyebrows done you have no clue how much shit I get for not getting my eyebrows done. They're a little bit messy I'll show you you know they're a little bit all over the place. I don't even pluck them I don't do anything to them I actually used to get them waxed But I stopped for some reason and probably shouldn't stop us Sixteen-year-old girls love brows when they're on that fleek last, but not least I'm gonna get my hair done I kind of want to take my hair to the next level. I've just been kind of being a pussy You know I get highlights and like it's kind of like a little bit more blonde gross I want to go f*ckin blonde as hell . Why mm. I don't know impulse. There's really no reason I've been talking for a long time, and I haven't done anything yet, which is not good You know what let's just hop right into it. Let's hop right into it. Let's just go. Let's just get started okay Let's just go get started all the boys better be on my block trying You know what I'm trying to say all these boys were no credit You know what I'm trying to say all of these boys gonna be sliding into my DMS Cuz I'm not gonna be no more twelve-year-old boy I'm gonna be a 16 year old girl and all these whole binary my DMS right now, though No one's in my goddamn the end But after this everybody's gonna be my dance all because of the eyebrows guys don't like girls with shitty eyebrows Just kidding if you decide that you don't like a girl because her eyebrows suck. You literally are going straight to hell Okay, so I'm on my way to the nail place, which also happens to be the eyebrow place which is super convenient But I am stressed out about one thing and that is that I don't know what color to get on my nails I'm getting acrylics by the way. I'm not just getting like gel nails like I am getting acrylics I'm gonna make those hose long you feel me I don't know What color to get I'm thinking maybe yellow because I love yellow, and I also need a little bit of brightness in my life Right now because my mental health is struggling if they have a good yellow color I'm gonna choose yellow, but if they don't then I'm gonna choose light pink okay I'm so glad that we're making this decision together I also haven't even made my hair appointment yet for tomorrow, so we will see how that goes this bitch Just jaywalked so bad and I almost hit her Doge a lot kids not good. You don't want to get killed. Yeah, okay? We're here. Can't wait to be beautiful. See you in there Okay, just got my nails and my other rounds done while the lady was doing my nails She was definitely judging them. They are number one dirty and number two uneven and number three I bite them I don't like them like really short like I bite them a little bit So they're all uneven and jagged and she wasn't a fan of them, so that was definitely something I think she's a little bit like ah this girl needs some help the lady who's doing my nails Also asked if I was in middle school. I was like no. I'm in high school like I'm 16 I've been out of middle school for like three years So that was flattering then the lady did my eyebrows And she told me that my eyebrows have no shape and that it's going to be a lot of work to fix them so she Really went to town on them, but I think that they look pretty damn good. I mean I was like yes, bitch Yes, I was really impressed with her skillÄj-- and I'm really happy I actually really like the eyebrows But I'm not gonna give my conclusions till the end so stay tuned see me up my nails are like yellow It's kind of an ugly color, but like I kind of fuck with it So let's give a little montage of my nails and my brows. Let's do it So I'm literally sitting in front of the hair salon that I go to right now And I'm gonna call and see if they have an appointment even though. I think they don't have to go in tomorrow Hi Hi, I would like to make an appointment for tomorrow If possible I want to get my hair dyed like completely blonde like full head blonde right now I have highlights that are like kind of grown out I don't know like if I can still get my full head blonde if I have like sparsely grown out highlights. Is that like possible? Thank you, and I guess I will see you tomorrow at the hair salon See you guys, then peace out. See you tomorrow peace. See you tomorrow to get the hair done peace Guys it's the next day, but I'm still wearing the same thing because I am literally discussing like that today's a day We're getting my hair extremely blonde. I am so excited. I could poop Hopefully they can do what I want them to do I mean I don't think it's too complex of a request won't see if they can do that for me This morning when I was trying to leave my house I looked into my woman And I saw that my credit card was just not there nowhere to be found and I was like hmm that is very annoying so then I Called the nail salon that I was at yesterday and was on the phone if that for like 20 minutes And they were trying to look for my card because maybe I like left it there or whatever and they couldn't find it then I finally decided that I would look in my car to see if I like lost it in my Car and it was just sitting on the seat next to me Just sitting on the passenger seat just chillin and the moral of that story is don't be fucking stupid. I'm so hungry, too I literally didn't eat or drink any coffee, and I could be here for like multiple hours, and I just like didn't prepare myself So definitely not the smartest person actually I could get coffee right now Yeah, I don't have time should I get coffee I'm gonna get coffee. Okay. It's been decided I'm getting coffee I don't know what this video is but you're getting a nice coffee break, so enjoy I don't even know if I'm allowed to park here. That's the crazy thing. I'll be right back. Let's get some coffee Cheers I got my coffee from boba guys. It's really good. I haven't been here in a while though, but it's really good I've never been disappointed and that's all about it. This is literally the most random video I'm just doing everything we're doing everyone don't even have the key in the ignition. Okay, that's something to consider oh Shit, I just kind of hit that car, but just a little bit anyways um I don't cannot see shit Mmm Good coffee, and we're here we're at the salon. I cannot wait. I'm just hoping that she has a good job I don't know We'll see I'm gonna look like Hannah, Montana, and I cannot wait pretty excited to not be 12 year old boy anymore That's gonna. Be nice. All right. I'm gonna go in. I'll see you when I'm done What's up, okay, so just finish getting my hair done. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out It's not exactly as blond as I wanted but she said that she couldn't give it to me as blonde as I wanted because my hair is already kind of partially damaged and If she bleaches my hair like that She said that part of my hair would fall out and I would go partially bald Which is not something that I want, but I do feel more blonde so far I'm not having more fun, but I don't mind because I didn't have high expectations, but the lady was super sweet We had some great conversations That's what getting your hair is done is all about it's all about having those great conversations With the hair ladies am I right ladies and gents She said that over time we can make my hair look as blonde as I want But we can't do it all in one shot or else I'll go bald like I get it okay, but we'll see but admit it I look a little bit better when I'm blonde less ugly now that we've done the final makeover. It's time for the conclusion right now Let's talk about our experience, okay, so starting out with the nails I get to do shit like this hold on Which definitely makes me feel like less of a 12 year old boy because I've never seen a 12 year old boy do that so Fuck off then we have the brows okay the brows. Oh my god I mean they look ten times better my penis Fennel you know what I mean, and then last but least the blonde hair honestly I only that the blonde really adds to anything I think it's just more fun for me And it's just an excuse for me to ride off getting my hair done in my taxes Sorry, do I look more like a regular sixteen year old? I don't know comment down below, if these three elements of me Make me look less like a 12 year old boy and more like a 16 year old girl comment down below your opinion Honestly, I think that I still if I get twelve-year-old boy but I think that it's an improvement and I think that we're getting there all I need to do is go through puberty and then I'll look like a sixteen year old girl. That's about it for today's video. I think it was overall a great time I mean I think it's fun. This is all you know fun stuff. I don't need to do this shit I love me for me. You know what I mean. Love yourself when your eyebrows are done or when they're not done Love yourself when your hair is at its natural color Or if it's not love yourself when your nails look really bad who cares love yourself be yourself Let me know if I look more like a sixteen year old girl. I already know your answer is gonna be I still look But just spare my feelings and maybe tell me I look better. Okay. That's it Love you guys peace out this video is confusing and really bad I don't really know how this is gonna work and how to format it, and it's really a stupid video overall But we're working with what we have and I don't have any ideas and sometimes. I'm just uninspired and right now I'm a little bit uninspired, so this is kind of the content You're getting during this little period of time in between my creative idea boosts where I have ideas but right now I don't have any so this is what you're getting. Hope you don't mind Do you mind let me know down below? Do I look like a 16 year old girl now, or do I still look like a 12 year old boy? Let me know down below in the comments. Okay. Bye. That's all, bye. You"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-02-17T01:16:51Z,108440,2883412,4422,"Are you ready for this?! What's up guys, how are you? I'm so excited for today's vlog like I'm dead-ass so pumped. We're actually doing something interesting today We have such a fun day planned So let's talk about it. So today I'm going to San Francisco nothing new, but I'm meeting up with some special guys Getting fucking pumped. Today I'm meeting up with Marla Catherine and summer McKean, and we're doing a photo shoot. It's about 10:45 right now I'm meeting them at 2:30, so I'm leaving definitely a little bit early so that I can go get some coffee, and yeah That's about. It. Sorry if I seem like really like enthusiastic right now, and you're like uncomfortable by it It's just I don't do anything interesting in my life And I'm so excited to finally be doing something interesting and also I've been watching both Marla and the summer since like before I started my youtube like I've been watching them both for so long So it's just really cool to meet them But I'm going straight to a coffee shop right now because haven't had any coffee or food today Fuck. But I'm literally gonna be there so early like I'll get there probably two hours Before I have to meet which is so great. I love being early. I Love IT. I laugh at sorry oh so annoying Oh, let's do a little OTT shoes are Doc Martens. Aka. My favorite shoes say make you look like a badass bitch. Levi's 501 jeans My fav BAE's. They're not thrifted the I bought them at full price which was Particularly painful, then I'm wearing this shirt from brandy melville, but I literally got in like 8th grade And I only wore like once and I you just forgot it existed So I was like you know I let's pull it out in retirement my beanie is from forever 21 And my glasses are from Pakistan, and it's just time I'll see you when I get to the city. Bye Okay, so here's what's up? I'll make this quick because I'm driving right now. Let me tell you what's up? You hi you if you say now, okay, so I'm driving and I look on my windshield And I see that there's a note under my like windshield wipers, and I'm so anxious to see what it says I want to read it so bad It's literally fluttering on my windshield, and I just all I want to do is read it I don't know like it could be there's so many options Somebody could have hit my car and like that's their insurance info Or it's a secret admirer and someone has a crush on me And they want to admit it and so then they left that under my windshield because they're in love with me and that's their way Of confessing their love there are so many options, and I don't know which one. It's going to be so there it is There's the note so can't wait to get there so I can freakin read it because I'm so anxious about what it says Okay, so okay, so we just arrived in San Francisco cool, and let's go look at the note I'm so excited fun fact This isn't a joke like this is actually like this is like actually like like this is like this is was here This is just my life. Please read on camera. Okay, um hi Emma. Love your flaws would love to meet you one day I was so excited when I saw your car lmao shouted to Jonathan Krab 360 so go follow him guys Thanks, Jonathan for leaving that note on my car very much appreciate that okay. Well back to our regularly scheduled vlog I just parked I have to pay for parking and then I'm gonna get some food I don't know why I just said that like you already know what's going on I Got a coffee and a peanut-butter-and-jelly toast, and they was so delish so thank Jesus for that I literally have like two hours until I have to be there for the shoot So I'm just kind of chilling like I just don't have anything to do and this UPS guy is like staring at me, and I just am uncomfortable so Also I had a whole full-on dilemma while the camera was off so I look in the mirror And I'm like oh my god My makeup looks so fucking bad because my skin is really dry and flaky for some reason right now I don't know why I've been moisturizing and stuff, but it's like still really flaky, so don't know what something on there I'm not good at hygiene So I was like looking at my face and there was like all of the makeup like soaked into the dead skin And this is so gross anyways basically long story short my makeup look so bad like my face makeup I ended up taking a napkin and Pouring water on it and taking off all my face makeup because it looked so bad I have to like turn this way so that the UPS guy can't see that. I'm like talking to myself I don't know why you know if something interesting happens but for now I'm just gonna sit in my car and like decide if I should walk around Here a little bit more before we meet I don't know okay life is just a big roller coaster And I'm just along for the ride Just kidding I don't read books So Stupid so here's. What's up? I just went to Walgreens and got some makeup because I'm gonna redo my makeup Because my makeup looks so bad actually before I start let me do a haul I got some Neutrogena makeup wipes covergirl Ready Set gorgeous concealer some great lash Because this is like not the best mascara, but it's a classic. It's a classic Milani transparent face powder a kabuki brush and some Milani highlighter so this could go either really good or really bad like I'm so bad at makeup because I don't know how to do it because I don't usually wear it and like whenever I do wear it I regret it because it ends up like getting crusty So let me know down below how to not be bad at makeup cuz I'm working on that. Oh my god ow okay face It's now clean. I look really bad. I don't even know if this is my color, but we'll see let's blend with our fingers I used to do that when I was like 2 years old I miss my Beauty Blender. Actually. This is working kind of well Oh, that's actually good concealer. Isn't even my color though. I don't know comment down below This is my color, and I James Charles if you're watching this let me know ok, I can kind of fuck with that Let's now get out the setting powder I got translucent powder so that I wouldn't have to choose a color, and it's bright white so we'll see how that goes Okay now my face is starting to looking crusty again But whatever I give up at this point my face is just gonna be crusty like that's just how it's gonna be you know what? I mean now let's apply some highlighter damn boo Oh shit using the same brush cuz I don't have any class at all all the beauty gurus right now Who are watching this are like oh my god? This bitch is literally insane, but I never said that I was good at makeup so like you guys don't have any expectations Hopefully mascara time. I think I might have just found my new everyday makeup tutorial I'm not trying to brag though the mascara I usually use is the Too Faced better than sex mascara And it is wrote markula sleep better than this this mascara is so bad But it was the only one at the drugstore that I recognized so I decided to choose this one But I probably should've went out on a limb and gotten a different one cuz this mascaras looking so bad this mascara Sucks if you like it I don't know what you're talking about whoo In their right mind like literally goes to Walgreens and buys an entire new makeup collection and then does their makeup like five minutes before A shoot like who the fuck would ever do that me apparently makeup tutorials done. Haha peace out What's up, okay? So just parked in the area that we're meeting at I saw them when I was driving by it which was Is that them I think it is Broderick correct me if I'm wrong But I think that was the name of the older brother and Diary of a Wimpy Kid Don't quote me on that I don't know for sure, but just wanted to put it out there that I know that fact because I'm a realist and what?

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-02-12T00:06:47Z,113476,2446309,5628,"  i am so ugly today ooooooOOOOoooo what's up, how are you guys doing? i'm doing honestly... mediocre at best. as you probably know v-day is coming up valentine's day the big the big v-day. you know what I mean?  i would say valentine's day is one of those days that's pretty sad for those of us who aren't in a relationship. it can be kind of a sad day. well i don't think so anymore. i want to turn that shit around. this year, we're all gonna love valentine's day. those that are in relationships, those that are divorced, those that are single, those that are having an affair i think that you can have a great day spending valentine's day by yourself and i'm going to prove that to you today in today's video. today's video is just gonna be me showing you some things that you can do on valentine's day, if you're single, to have the best day of your life basically. if you're in a relationship, don't watch this video because nobody wants your s0rRy a$s iN h3rE this is for singles only. for us lonely hoes. you know what i mean? no i'm just kidding. if you want if you're in a relationship right now, you can watch it let's get into it it's time for our next valentine's day alone lonely tutorial activity the next steps having fun alone on valentine's day is to pamper yourself so that's what we're gonna be do-doing that's what we're gonna be dO-dOiNg DoDaY we're gonna be painting our nails and putting on a little nice face mask this is the simply whatever. these masks are such a mess, but you know what it doesn't matter. pampering yourself comes at a cost and the cost is making a mess in your whole entire house that you have to clean by yourself because you don't have a significant other to help you clean up that's what life's all about. it's a little bit scary honestly. oh um okay. god, you can already feel my skin glowing from within. let the pampering begin, baby okay, now that we have this all figured out, let's put on some nail polish i literally just reached into my bin and grab some random colors. i grabbed literally the ugliest colors. that's awesome i think i'm gonna go with this bright color here by the brand china glaze, so let's just get right into it. when i was younger i used to really be into painting nails. it was one of my main hobbies in life and now that i'm older i just don't care about it anymore as much. i literally used to do such cools designs and fun fact i actually had a nail painting account on instagram it doesn't exist anymore, so don't even try to find it. first coat is done. for a second coat we'll just do a different color. i think that painting nails is a really fun and relaxing activity. it's super fun to do when you just kind of hate yourself i've never felt more pampered in my life than i do at this exact moment, and I'm proud of me that's the thing is that in life you can't be focused on relationships because relationships come and go but you're stuck with yourself forever because guess what? all your relationships are going to probably end at some point unless you're like the 1% of people that don't get divorced um you know what i mean? like at the end of the day, it's just you and you. nails are finished i just got to sit here and wait for my mask to just kind of settle in so let's gossip. let's just talk about i don't know what do people gossip about? let me tell you my ideal man just like tell you what my type is you know. i am so flexible when it comes to men. it really doesn't matter. it could be anyone. i mean it could be anyone from magcon i am so flexible. it's really important to me if they have a lot of money. yeah i don't care about their personality at all. uh they can be so rude to me as long as they're rich and they buy me stuff, i don't care it's like if i have a rolls royce in the garage, who cares if i come home to a shitty husband why would you marry someone who isn't in the top 1%? you're stupid if you don't. no do you know what? guys i'm totally jk'ing. for real on the real low, the most important thing in a guy is whether or not they have flow game if a man doesn't have good hair, it's over. if he's bald, that's fine. he just has to look good bald you know what i mean? it's all about looks personality is nothing. flow game is number one. looks is number two and how good they are at fortnite is number three everything else doesn't matter. how are you gonna feel walking down the aisle with a man who has never won fortnite? okay that's embarrassing. the moral of the story is flow game, money, flow game, fortnite skills, nunchuck skills, bow hunting skills, nunchuck skills, bow hunting skills girls only want boyfriends who have great skills. alright let me give you a little overview of my fuck what happened these are my nails i don't know if you can see it turned out pretty good not trying to brag though and then it's time to take off this facial mask so oh god, ew sorry that is why i'm single. actually do you know what? let's just continue chatting while i take off my nail polish because did you really think i was gonna leave this on? nail polish is for pansies ow i have so many hang nails and the acetone is just seeping into them like a motherfucker anyways now that i've been joking about what i care about in a man let's talk about what i really care about in a man. number one, funny. if that hoe ain't funny, it's over. actually do you what? no one cares about what i really like in a guy, but yeah pampering yourself i know i've already talked about it, but let's talk about it again because I have nothing else to talk about. pampering yourself important and crucial because that's what it's all about is making yourself feel like a princess because guess what? you are your own princess in your own kingdom of life and you aren't defined by anything except for who you are in your heart. if you ever get in a relationship you know cuz all of us singles out here, we're gonna get in relationships at some point we're in this together, and it might be down the line, but it might be tomorrow, and that's what's crazy but either way the thing about us is we're the strong ones ya know what i mean? if you're in a relationship and you're still for some reason watching this, listen up don't define yourself based on like who you're dating. a lot of people their hobby, their life, everything that they do, their an identity becomes their relationship. don't do that i haven't had a boyfriend in my life but i still know that this is true. your significant other should be a secondary part of your life and your first aspect of your life should be how badass you are because that's what really matters at the end of the day. don't be known as blank's girlfriend or blank's boyfriend. do you know how f*cking boring that is? so boring. be known as yourself. be someone individually so that you can be even better in a relationship. have your own hobbies, bring something unique to the table, don't forget to have some time to yourself and don't forget to have a life outside of your relationship because that's what's most important, and that's what's gonna make you the happiest in your relationship, and that's it for that. moving on all righty. and for our last valentine's day activity we're going to be making some chocolate strawberries for obvious reasons i think a lot of people fantasize about having someone else make some chocolate strawberries for them and or going to a edible arrangements and getting them a $50 chocolate strawberry bouquet or some shit anyways i think that's kind of a dream that all of us have considering that chocolate strawberries are so good like they're genuinely so tasty. but do you what? having Edible Arrangements make them for you or having like your boyfriend slash girlfriend slash significant other make them for you, that's boring. make them yourself and stop being a pussy. ew these strawberries are so like not great what a disappointment. chocolate strawberries are so easy to make but like i'm still gonna take you through it just in case you're kind of stupid okay, the first step is to rinse your strawb's which i just did. perfect. and also i recommend you buy organic because you don't want those unnecessary pesticides in your lonely body now do you? and we're gonna melt the chocolate. now today i'm gonna be using some dark chocolate because i have class unlike some people, but if you don't like dark chocolate cuz i don't know don't have a penis, you can use milk chocolate too and you're basically just gonna warm it you're basically just going to warm up the chocolate in 30-second intervals for like a while until it all melts it's pretty self-explanatory. let's continue our discussion that we're having earlier um i don't know what we were talking about earlier so i forgot but uh yeah, so that's about it we're just gonna play the silent game for the rest of this video i guess just kidding i don't like silence, makes me uncomfortable. well let's warm it up. i hope that it's enough chocolate i don't really know. should i warm up more? nehh that's fine i had a phase there where i was like making chocolate strawberries like every day because they're just so good. dark chocolate isn't even that bad for you, and it has antioxidants in it. we love science oh god i hate waiting for the chocolate to warm up though it's so rude. chocolate strawberries are a really romantic food according to michelangelo, that's a fake fact. let's actually make some coffee while we're waiting for this to warm up brb let's talk about valentine's day in elementary school what a time to be alive am i right peeps? i don't know if they did this in every school, but there's a lot of noises going on, my elementary school we would give each other little mini valentines and it was so cute and so fun for all of the little tots to walk around the classroom and give each other little valentines. i'm literally doing 20 things at once and i'm a little bit stressed out. are you guys stressed out? let me know in the comments. oh my god look at this shit right? god fuckin stoopid. it's fuckin stoopid thicc. cheers. chocolate is so good. watch and learn, baby barista in the making you know that right, you heard that right, you got that right. now top it off with some of this coffee is done. cheers. you take a strawberry and you dry it off because i don't know i think you're supposed to do that then you just simply dunkaroo and put it straight onto the plate bon apple tit. alright, baby? that's all it takes. while we're doing this, let's just chat so how are the kids? alright tough crowd. thing is about these strawberries, they're not that great i always try to buy organic ones even though they don't always look as good as the non-organic i'm trying not to add excess pesticides to my body although tempting. pesticides are fun and pesticides are crazy so it's like hard for me you know what i mean? i'm kind of getting sick of this it does get a little bit boring after a little bit, dipping all of these strawberries every five f*ckin minutes you know what i've never liked when i was like younger and stuff? i don't like when strawberries are too big i kind of like when they're small like how am i supposed to fit that into my mouth? that's what she said. you set yourself up for that one it gets to the point where it's so big that it's just not even good anymore i wonder how much of the world is single. i'll google that. i'm gonna insert that percentage right here i feel like everyone's in a freakin relationship these days. maybe it's cuz it's cuffing season. okay there's no more room on this f*cking plate i'm so annoyed. watch and learn. we got some excess chocolate in here look at how we do it. dip, oh yeah baby good. yeah so i definitely recommend you make these at home. they're super good, super easy and fun not too messy i mean cooking is always a little bit messy oh my god, i have a rash all over my face. what the f- NO is that? i don't. okay that's it for today's video, i hope you enjoyed it. i hope it was fun for you I love you And do you know what? let's be each other's valentines this year because for all of us out here who don't have a valentine yeah it sucks. i don't care because we're each other's valentines this year. be my valentine?

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-02-09T00:59:45Z,83647,2127879,3532,"Hi, how are you? We haven't really been intimate lately me and you we haven't been talking and I missed that so in today's video I thought that we'd kind of be a little bit more intimate and do a little something something you know what i mean and that something is a Q and A I am sorry Q and A's are lazy, but sometimes you have those lazy days And I also have a burrito here because I've been eating so many burritos lately like it's probably bad But Cheers actually let me take a bite of this. Oh shit. It's leaking. I don't I didn't get napkins That's not gonna be good for me. *eating noises* *groans* I don't even want to talk I just want to eat, but this is a mukbang or Mook bang or whatever the fuck. Okay but at some point I probably have something in my teeth and that's when everything's gonna go down That's when everything's gonna go downhill, but dude question number one. Do you ship Kip in lafawndah? Yes, actually. I have a few little ships that I have let's talk about it my OTPs If you don't know what OTP means because you're not hip it's one true pairing I have a few number-one kip and Lafawndah 100% number two Jim and Pam from the office absolutely The biggest goals look if I don't find a man like Jim. I'm gonna be frickin pissed. It's too Good to be true, Jim and Pam cheers you guys can you make a meme out of this yeah? Not a question, but your dad dances better than. See It's so I post one video with my dad and everybody's like we like your dad more than you that is offensive. I'm offended I'm also getting salsa all over my car don't care. Oh, San Francisco or LA I grew up in San Francisco, or like near it so probably San Francisco Just because I haven't really explored too much of LA whereas me and SF. Go way back. You know what I mean We're like old buddies old pals. I'm gonna go with San Francisco. Sorry, LA I don't know, but maybe one day I'll move there and be one of those basic hoes And then I'll let you know if my opinion Changes if you could sleep with one celebrity who would it be I think I'd probably sleep with Cee Lo Green because he just seems He just seems like he would keep me warm. I'm enjoying this a lot. Wemma?If you're talking about me and Whitney  Houston Yes (beautiful singing) You know what I mean? I'm not trying to brag Why are you not verified yet if someone who works at Twitter is watching this or Instagram for that matter verify my ass alright I want people to take me seriously no one takes you seriously Unless you're verified So sad that this burrito is like almost over like I feel like I've only been eating it for like two seconds you had to Pick a weird fetish to have what would it be and why? I kinda have a burrito fetish right now. She's almost gone! Best thing you've ever thrifted. Okay one time. This is crazy I've thrifted vintage Levi's mom jeans for fucking five dollars, baby. It was crazy. I lost my shit It was insane. Can you breathe and talk at the same time let's find out? What has been your least favorite popular slang word over the past few years well Let's talk about a few number one. I used to hate hella. Maybe that's just a barrier thing I know, but I used to hate when people would say hella I thought it was so annoying and now I say it so it's like I can't even hate it anymore because I'm using it I Don't like slang like ""slay"" I don't like yeet like ""YEET"", I used to hate bae, but now I also say that all the time all right I love it burrito is gone so now. It's just a Q&A mukbang is over Also, my hair is so flat to my head right now. Oh god. Please write me a poem about swans ok Swans are lots of fun. Swans are found in ponds ok I know swans are lots of fun swans love everyone Swans are lots of fun. Swans are extremely cute. yay. Swans are found in ponds, and that was my haiku I was really good at writing haikus when I was younger. I'm not trying to brag, but can I be in this video? Sure. Will you ever look directly at the camera and your Instagram pics? No. Okay, because when I look straight on it's not cute. But when I look to the side It's better and that's how it's always gonna be so get used to it or unfollow. Sorry that was kind of mean. What's the best advice you could give someone... Don't be sad, be happy! Last picture on your camera roll, let's take a little look. I actually don't know oh my god my last photo was a cute photo of the sunset that I took the other day the Sun was just looking so pretty and I Was just in love so there it is Top three songs at the moment. Let's do it Sorry. Last picture in your snap memories. Great, now I have to go find it. Thanks. Let's see what we have in here and probably some bad stuff That is boring. What's the best water? Okay, 100% smart water, but I also like LaCroix. If that's considered water I don't know at the place that I got my burrito, they gave me Crystal Geyser, and I am NOT okay with it, but Yeah, toontown or club penguin? Toontown was for gaming, but Club Penguin. I was a little bit. I kind of had a different mindset with Club Penguin I was kind of more just trying to find a bae on club penguin because Club Penguin was where I had my first relationships I had so many boyfriends on Club Penguin. Yeah, if you're watching this what's up? You know what I mean, but no Club Penguin was for social hour toontown was for grind hour I was on that grind when I played toontown, but now it's all about fortnite. Give us a little story time I'll have to think about that. I'll have to come back to that one. 69 or 420. It's very serious I agree it is very serious And the answer is 69 because you know what don't do drugs kids Gibby or guppy this question doesn't make sense to me But the answer is always Gibby because I am and iCarly stan. Speaking of iCarly lil pump and icarly like making love. I don't know its a little weird. Favorite day of the week. Oh definitely Sunday. Sunday is the day when I just find myself I rediscover who I am and I live my best life. Sundays have the best vibe of the whole week. It's just when good things happen. Coffee or fortnite. Okay coffee makes me happy but fortnite makes my heart skip a beat I'm not good at fortnite, though. It's something that I care about but it's not Something that I thrive at I'm not a gamer girl for all of you people who don't know what fortnite is, cause i feel like there's going to Be some people who don't it's a video game because I'm a gamer girl. Just kidding. No. I'm not I'm so bad at it I've literally I don't have actually ever killed someone, which you're like supposed to do like I've never killed someone before but it's so fun Literally after I finished filming this i'ma play for tonight. Do you wish you had siblings hell to the fucking no I love having attention to all to myself I love that and if I had a sibling no I mean I'd have to share a lot more of attention And I don't like that so there it is. Oh I also thought of my storytime finally. It's not gonna be a good story time. I bought a new black pop socket to put on my phone and it freakin broke If you don't know what a popsocket is I feel-I just assume that people don't know what stuff is just in case A pop socket is this. I bought a new one but it broke and they're ten dollars each and it broke, like I was pissed Stop right now, shut the fuck up Smash or pass Guy Fieri. 100 percent smash. I've been trying to smash. Just kidding. That's like Really illegal. Also. I don't know how to pronounce his last name, and I'm gonna get roasted for it I also I'm gonna get roasted for how I pronounce mukbang or mook bong or muck or Mook bang or Mook But I don't fucking know. Are you emotionally okay? Thank you so much for asking, um no. Hydroflask, or swell bottle, choose wisely. Just bay area things. Haha. This is true If you don't know what those water bottles are let me explain They are water bottles that are like they insulate so then you're ice like never melts Here's the thing I have both a swell bottle and a hydroflask and here's the difference with swell bottles They look cool, and they are cool the top of them is so small and so like narrow You can't even put ice in it. It's fucking stupid whereas a hydro Flask is just way better even fit as much ice in it as you want the top is nice and big and open Hide your flask all the way, I'm sorry swell if you want too small to me then okay But unless you want to sponsor me the answer is Hydroflask What is your dream vacation? I've been asking my parents for the last few summers if we can go to North Korea And they always say no, but I want to go there. I hear they've really good beaches. Let me insert a photo Yeah, like look how pretty it is I've literally everyone wants to go there second favorite coffee if it was possible to not drink an almond milk latte Maybe like a soy milk latte or like an oat milk latte. Yeah, there's something called oat milk supposedly. It's really good I haven't tried it, but it's like milk made out of oats Fucking crazy vegans these days. Can I smash? Of course. Baby names? I think this is very fitting considering Kylie just had a baby When I have a baby no one's gonna give a fuck about my baby whereas You know when Kylie has a baby freaking she gets like 29 million views in like five minutes on her freakin video of her Baby, you know I'm gonna give a fuck about my baby. Sorry I'm just little salty but speaking of which let's talk about some names I actually have always been someone where I just don't like any specific names but I have to really think about this because I just don't like names there's names that I like but I like know people who have those names So if I say their name it's gonna get awkward um so I have to think about this and be creative. God damn it You're not fucking okay. I'll name my kid something weird Apple or some shit favorite quote Let's go to my Pinterest so um my favorite quote personally is one by Vanessa Hudgens She's definitely my inspiration if you didn't already know She is the Coachella Queen, and I'm so inspired by her and all of her kind of ideas I want to go to Morocco really bad Vanessa Hudgens I love that one actually do you know what I'm not gonna stop at one quote Let's keep going sometimes memories sneak out of my eyes and roll down my cheeks And last but not least a quote by selena my queen go through a rough breakup nothing a little dance party with friends can ease Would you prefer to have no more acne or no more ice almond milk lattes honestly I don't do saying anything to never have acne again so I'm just gonna have to say goodbye to coffee peace out when my spirit my Scare is clear when my skin is clear my life is together acne is the worst oh my god I just got a fortnight text how to make friends don't ask me like I'm not a good person to ask, but let's see if I can give me some advice I'd say the best way to create friends is just strike up a conversation You know if you see someone in there playing golf walk up to him and be like yo I love the shape of golf balls. You know what I mean I love golf and I love Tiger Woods and just start striking up a conversation about the fact that they're playing golf maybe you guys both have in common that you really love American Idol and You love watching it, then you can be like yo, let's go watch American Idol sometime together Is that show even still a thing? I don't know what is your scariest cheer experience? Oh do I have a story for you so one time I was performing on stage It was like my first performance on a new team my boob fell out of my uniform It just popped out this was our uniforms. It wasn't hard for things to just pop out, but I guess I didn't plan accordingly and And it fell out long story short my boob fell out Patriots are eagle. I literally don't give a flying fuck about football I Couldn't care less about something in his life than I do like there's a one thing that means less to me than football and that Is it actually I need to answer one more because I was just like that was a horrible one to end off on oh My god, I thought for a second that James Charles just tweeted at me, and I got so excited But it wasn't him he didn't tweet at me, so I actually got scared though cuz he was roasting someone And I thought for something he was roasting me Close one the last question that I'm going to answer is Literally a question that I get asked every single day and June what I'm just cleared up I'm gonna clear it up the question that everybody's been asking is do I like Ethan Dolan or grayson dolan better? Now I don't like to say this kind of stuff You know I've been kind of an Ignoring this question cuz I'm just like I don't want anyone know my lane that I'm in you know I don't want anyone know you know I've kind of been trying to keep it on the DL the down-low um, but I'm done I'm done keeping it on the down-low. I'm finally gonna tell you guys which lane. I'm in right now. Okay. Are you ready guys I? Am in Alright yeah peace You"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-02-05T00:23:13Z,152918,4137847,7671,"You so fucking precious when you smile hit it from the back and drive you wild Girl I lose myself up in those eyes I just had to let you know you're mine That was a lot... that was a lot... that was crazy (mhhmmmh huuuh) It's crazy. what's up guys, good morning? It's like 9:30 a.m.. In the morning Okay, anyway. I'm making my nice morning coffee. You know the drill, but let me give you a little rundown about what's up. So basically today I'm driving up into the mountains of California To visit my grandpa-- well actually not just my grandpa my other family too, of course. Pretty pumped about it He lives about six or seven hours away from where I live And I don't even know where he lives because it's so far away It's very like remote, and there's no Wi-Fi so that's not good and I'm worried about it. Luckily, I'm only gonna not have Wi-Fi for like one day because we're only gonna be there for like one full day - Anyway, that's not important. It's not gonna be pretty. That's all I have to say. BUT today, I'm going to be vlogging my road trip I'm road trippin with my dad, and it's gonna be so lit You know we're planning on Stopping a little bit to take some photos along the way, we might stop and get like a burrito somewhere because I'm really Trying to eat a burrito right about now. Anyways, moral of the story is on the way there. We're gonna Have a good time. We're gonna get some food. We're gonna just get lit. And I think road trips are fun So you're just gonna come along with me, but we're not on the road yet, so before we can do that.... It's time to make some coffee *whirring* Look how cute my new phone case is. It's from Wildflower. I'm in love with them I'll link it down below cause it's so fucking cute. Look at how cute it is! I like road trips a lot when I like make the most out of it. We have like plans along the way I don't like when it's just like a road trip, and you just have to like sit in the car *phone dings* When you just have to like sit in the car for like 7 hours and like you don't get to like you don't get anything Out of it except for like the final destination. I like to make the road trip itself fun because that's what life's about it... so... There we go, she's done I'll see you when I do something else a little bit more interesting because for now it's not gonna be interesting So see you then alright Hey guys, so just got on my outfit So let me give you a quick little OOTD because we all know how fun an OOTD is. All right, We got Doc Martens. Jeans are from Urban Outfitters, they're the brand bdg, I believe. Belt and shirt are both from forever 21 And then glasses are from PacSun I have to go walk my dogs and shit then my dad's gonna get here And we're gonna get on the road. You guys excited? I know I am. Alright see ya a lil bit (hehah) We're fricken out here boy Yeah, it's good. You're leaving the back seat empty because I'm gonna fill that whole thing We're fricken out here boy. That's all I have to say we're ready to go and it's gonna be a great time What do you think? DAD: I think it's gonna be good as long as we can find you some good coffee We're gonna have to find a place with almond milk. DAD: but we're up for it! No and if we can't do it I'll just swallow a burrito hole instead. Okay, so first before we start driving there to put on the chapstick This is Burt's Bees acai berry. What are you doing? after I get gas can you drive because I'm just sick of this already whaaaah! *car starts saying random shit* This fucking happens to me once every blue moon. I can't- I've never known how to turn that off You know some cars have like the thing so that when you're backing up like you can (hyyynahh) DAD: Oh yeah, the little computer? hhhhhh I don't think... My dad's putting his stuff into my trunk so that we can (phhhh) hit the road, Jack. I just really feel like I forgot something crucial what if I forgot a charger for something because the thing is it's not like you can just run out and like get something if You need it because my grandpa lives in a very Remote area like there's literally nothing around him except for like farms if you forget something you're genuinely fucked so We'll see if I forgot something... I brought my iPad I was going to bring my DS on this trip because I usually bring my DS when I go But this year I didn't bring my DS because I couldn't fricken find it anywhere I literally looked for my DS for like an hour, but I did bring my iPad so like I can play temple run But I wanted to play Mario Kart. You know what I'm saying. I'm really hyped up on coffee right now. You're paying the price I'm sorry, okay Let's go to the gas station See the funny part about it is like I've been going to his house since I was like a little tot But I still don't know where it is like on a map I would think that people of your generation Like young people because they like use their phones for directions and everything and don't really look at maps You don't really get a feeling I mean if you look at a map Emma: No uhhh- I mean if you look at a map, from like an overview, I don't know for me that gives me like a really clear idea of where everything is... Emma: It does- I can also look at a map and not even know exactly what the roads are and sort of head in the right direction EMMA: stop flexing on me *creepy forced laughter* Honestly, though Siri fucks me up so much She kind of like screws me over half the time But I'm like thankful for her cause she cares about me, like I know she cares about me It's just that-- DAD: except that time that it took you off into ***** Emma; Oh my gosh! DAD: I'm getting fricken whiplash! I'm not like a reckless driver, but when I'm alone like I will make last-minute decisions, and I will give myself whiplash But now that my dad's in the car I have to drive like 25 on the freeway, and it's like really hard But that's why I want him to drive even though this is my car This is my whip him touching the wheel just feels wrong ya know? Yeah, no, I'm good to just sit here. No. It's okay, though You're driving. DAD: okay. EMMA:I've kind of done this rant. I did a rant once where I'm like Why do people get so annoying about cars? It's not an important status symbol unless you have a Tesla then you're superior I don't feel like I'm allowed to go in this way. It's too late. It's literally too late like I already did We out here at the gas station, fam. What's up? (hyuah) The gas here is so freakin expensive It's just not fair. And there goes all of my money! White van is staring at me This is just how my life is. Last vlog I was talking about how I feel like everyone's gonna kill me and everybody was like no one's gonna kidnap you. You're too ugly Yeah, fuck you whoever said that by the way. Fuck you, okay? Fuck off It is now uhm 12:02 life is great life is crazy life's been crazy. How's it been? DAD: It's been great We are stopping to get some coffee because... DAD: Oh fun fact for everyone We're in Gilroy, which is the Garlic capital of the world? maybe? I don't know I don't want to google it so yeah If you eat garlic, chances are I came from here Is that true? emmas dad: I.. I don't actually know if that's true. yeah, that was- (groans in disapproval) I just Yelped... I looked up coffee shops in Gilroy and there was literally one five minutes away So I was like fam, we out here fam, so we're gonna get some coffee I'm gonna get decaf because I already had a caffeinated today And I don't want to number one pee my pants and number two shit my pants and then number three.. Dad: Go insane Exactly because if I have literally more than two caffeinated coffees these days, I have a full-fledged freak out. But yeah life is crazy. We've been driving for about an hour now [emma.exe has stopped working] Just gossiping about all the Hoe's you know? Pretty excited to get this coffee. How about you? Are you gonna get something? Yeah for sure [sexy jazz music] bone apple tit hehe xdd DAD: Oh, ya know what, there's seating outside! You wanna sit outside? DAD: Yeah yeah yeah Okay, we're gonna sit outside... Can try my latte first? [fucking harasses the coffee cup] [beats the living shit out of the straw] [stabs the coffee cup like a murderer] [slorps coffee] Ooh~ That's really good if you're in Gilroy come to fifth Street Coffee Roasting Co It's actually really good, and I don't say that about many places so keep that in mind. Okay. Wow nice bath and Bodyworks bag He keeps his vegan bananas in there. DAD: Yeah as opposed to the non vegan bananas, which actually have bacon in the center *emma literally dies from laughing* [lit ass music plays] *emma wtf are u doin* *emma what the actual fuck* *BITCH JUST FUCKIN DISAPPEARED* *oh wait nvm* *YOU BETTER STOP* *BITCH STOP* *is confused in dad* (Sexy music plays) (eerie music plays) We literally drove for like 10 minutes, and then we found a cool area for photos. Let me show you a little bit We have all of this green like very open space kind of looks like a Windows background Then we have this I don't know okay, we have some... ... plants? Let's see what happens. At this rate, we're probably never gonna get to Grandpa's house, but whatever. DAD: It's all about the journey, man DAD: It's all about the journey *why.* DAD: Okay, you can delete that Hoe coming to try and kill us Moving on from that. That was fun, but I've gotta keep going. You know I mean we're gonna find many more places hopefully if life treats us right but we'll see. Hi. Oh my god, it looks like a fucking teacher. Let's change that. Better. So we've been driving for like another like I don't know 45 minutes, and it's burrito time bitches We just stopped at a place. It looks really good. Here we go. It's right here... We're trying to find parking now, but we really want a burrito Waiting for my burrito to come out pretty dissapointed because they don't have black beans they only have refried beans but *turns into a fucking horse* What can ya do. All right, we're gonna take some pics selfie with bae xdd hehe DAD:Uh, do you wanna feel what an earthquake feels like? No. DAD: Watch! Why are you doing this? It's good its spicy :( Both of these burritos together were $8 we love a bargain don't we queen? DAD: You are makin that burrito pay. *scoffs because im queen* Yeah Just chillin with BAE I don't know why I'm like still filming like I've been filming me eating this burrito for like 20 minutes I'm turning this off. We just finished our burritos They were actually good like even though it wasn't black beans, and it was refried. They were still really good the salsa was also good Oh my god (starts choking) But yeah, so food was definitely 10 out of 10 one of the better burritos I've had. I don't feel like uncomfortable You know sometimes when you like need a burrito and afterwards like wow I actually feel like Pregnant why you don't feel pregnant right now, so like really surprised and impressed, anyways.. yeah, back on the road now Peace out squad squad. Love you all. (hehhah) hope you're loving this vlog so far subscribe if you like it No, just kidding. So we're back in the car life is good and life is crazy. We're not even like that close to our final destination And we've literally been driving for like four hours um You just ate a burrito and now you're eating an apple. okay? How do you think this road trip's been going so far? DAD: so far it's great no traffic Do you need me to turn on maps? DAD: no no I got it. Okayyy. You say that now... (uhhuhhhhuh) Mhh you're gonna regret it... You're doing an apple mukbang I'm proud of you. DAD: Oh, yeah! You just have to chew a little bit louder DAD: I'm working on that. Okay, so this is a pink lady... *instant cringe and regret* Sorry about that guys. Guys can we talk about burritos For a second. They are so good. They're important to me. He's always eating burritos when I was growing up He always used to eat burritos all the time That's like your comfort food of choice like a lot of people go to McDonald, Burger King, Wendy's you know Krispy Kreme?

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-02-02T08:12:06Z,59372,1119737,3871,"What's up guys today's video is gonna be freaking crazy- buckle your seatbelt. Here's what's gonna go on today. Right now I'm visiting my grandpa at his house. He has a nice ranch here in um.. actually I'm not gonna tell you where he lives My grandpa lives in the exact same county that Bigfoot was first spotted- am I trying to brag? No. But am I bragging? Yes I have the opportunity today to go search for bigfoot... Myself. I know that it's daylight, and I think that Bigfoot might be nocturnal, But I don't give a fuck I'm gonna find this motherfucker :) Lets go. *music* I don't know where to start okay. I haven't done a lot of research on Bigfoot himself, but I really don't care He's gonna be out here somewhere, so just follow me. What is Bigfoot like? People with big feet. Probably have a big appetite What do you think Bigfoot eats? I don't know actually uh hi :) shut the fuck up alright, are those poops yours? Okay. That could be something. What if those poops aren't his? Show the poops Were those poops yours? Usually when people don't respond that means... no those aren't my poops because if they were his poops He would own up. Do you know whose poops those are? Bigfoots. Follow me *music* If those were his poops that means like he was here recently meaning that we need to act fucking FAST. As you can see here that's ripped. Try to name one- literally one creature that can do that. I can't Bigfoot, moving on :) stump, that was not cut by human being. If you can look up there see look at those rough edges. Was that not by a beaver? I think not, TOO HIGH. Was that picked off by woodpeckers? Don't think so. There's only one real explanation and it's Bigfoot :) God, it's too easy pfff moving on This video sucks because we're not gonna find Bigfoot. Should I scrap it? No I should keep going should I climb over that? uh-huh *music* Oh God *More music* OWW *music* This is a poop right here, and you see that little hole right there. Let me tell you a little something Bigfoot he's smarter than we think ok? He's onto something That's why we haven't found him yet as you can see here this little piece of a cow poop See how this chunk of that was taken out isn't exactly perfect circle. It is being used for science Bigfoot has a lab I don't know where it is It could be a meth lab, but it could also be a science lab, and here's what I'm thinking he's trying to take DNA from cows to use it for his tests Hey an issue has arose or arise an issue has arose I don't know is that gramatically incorrect? My camera crew has decided to ditch me because they're too scared and they think that we're getting too close to finding him I think they need to calm the fuck down they went inside to get some chocolate milk And they left me out here to die. I don't care because if I'm gonna find Bigfoot I'm okay with doing it alone because guess who's gonna get all the credit Me. I didn't want to share the fame anyways Sorry, a fly just flew past my head. Let's see what we can find hold on I might have found something I might be mistaken, but this looks like Bigfoot's house *bigfoot roars* oh my god, It might have just been like some birds in there or something but Do you think that was that him? rumor has it There's not just one Bigfoot There's a whole fucking family of Bigfoots You know what? I'm trying to say like if there's one right there chances. Are they're everywhere all right? I'm approaching this Slender Man head ass looking forest, and I'm starting to feel like I'm not alone I'm not kidding feel like there's someone with me. I feel a presence *creepy music* Bigfoot? Biggie? Big? Biggie? Bigman? Bigfoot? Come out come out have a gift for you Antlers you can look just like a deer have you heard of reindeer have you heard of Rudolph? *bigfoot roars* Starting to get scared this is getting real really quick. There's no way that I just heard some sort of Bigfoot head ass sounds twice in a row and this motherfucker aint around here There's no way look at what? What else could that even be have you ever heard a dog sound like I feel like I'm getting closer to him What's this oh my god? Hey you see this. What is it? It looks like a coffee bean, but it's bigger doesn't this look like a coffee bean to you. I have an idea. if Bigfoot exists? He's gonna need something that'll get him up in the morning and what is that for humans coffee? but for Bigfoot maybe big coffee Explaining why the beans are bigger Bigfoot has definitely been here the proof is damning is that even what people say? I don't know. I'm not very smart anyways I'm kinda starting to feel like I need to stop looking, but I can't stop now Do you know how much money I could make if I find Bigfoot They're gonna read documentaries made about me movies books will be written if I don't find this hoe I'm gonna miss out on a fortune. I have a lot of things I want to buy like a jet ski, so I can't stop now But I just need to think about a way to creatively find this hoe I think that the best way to do it is just by being silent and letting him come to me But what would attract big foot like what does Bigfoot even like he probably likes the gifts? I mean who doesn't like gifts right so maybe if I gather some gifts for him And maybe just sit quietly and meditate and wait maybe he'll come I think that's what I have to do But now I have to find some gifts for him And I just like don't know if he likes he's so picky like does bigfoot celebrate Christmas Do you think I don't know just even know what a gift is I don't really care I just need to get a gift for him, but all I can see on the ground is poop This is perfect Bigfoot come pay me a visit You thick hoe I just want to be friends. I don't have a lot of friends Maybe we could be each other's front we can play some games I can babysit your kids if you want we can go to Pilates classes together. I even have a gift for you Hey, no I'm *bigfoot roars* *music* No he's trying to kill me guys he's ready to kill him gotta go he's chasing me. No he's getting closer. He's getting closer, no no *roars* *music*"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-01-29T00:22:10Z,89154,2430372,3662,"Good morning Oh God. Good morning guys. You know the drill by now. Here's what goes on I'm going to the city-- I'm literally it's like a broken re cord player saying this again. I'm SORRY I'm going to the city today to meet up with my dad to hang out in the city San Francisco and take photos and such. we're meeting at 7:00. It's 6:40 I'm very late. Again. Guess what else? I need to get gas which will make me even more late, so I'm really going to be late And he's gonna have to wait for me, and I feel bad. We're meeting at a coffee place. You know how it is. I just hate myself. What can you do?You feel me? Like if you're late, you're late, you know what I mean? That was the risk people took when they decided to make plans with me. It's just you don't know if imma be late or not. That's why I have no friends. No. I'm just kidding I don't have friends for other reasons um. Oh, let me do with a little quick OOTD my pants are thrifted They're these weird ass looking red. I don't really My dad's calling me. hello? I'm late. I'm gonna get gas. I woke up. No well I woke up at the time that I wanted to leave right before bed. I was like okay I'm gonna wake up at 6:20 so that I can leave at 6:20 Whatever, I'll see you when you get here. Whenever you get here. I hate myself for this. Okay. I feel bad I need to get my gas so hold on a sec Well there goes the truck so it looks like I'm not gonna be talking okay? Why is this person--? UGH I hate being at the gas station. it's my least favorite place Cannot wait to leave. I can't wait to leave Oh my god these people think they're gonna kill me waiting for my receipt to print okay Get me out of here got gas. now I'm on my WAY Thank goodness as I kind of explained while I was on the phone briefly But I didn't really explain very clearly last night I set my alarm for the time that I was supposed to be leaving I don't know what I was thinking so that was not my smartest move AH. Just drove over a curb, but hey, I got a full tank of gas, and I'm ready to fucking party. Oh wait I never did a full OOTD Let's do an OOTD then let's finish that up. My pants are these thrifted seventies inspired pants They're ugly, but they're kind of 70s So let it slide, then I'm wearing a crop strokes band T which I got from Urban Outfitters And then cropped myself the last, but not least I'm wearing a thrifted denim jacket. It's actually not thrifted I don't think actually I think it was my mom's, but I count it as thrifted because it's old so if anyone asks It's thrifted not from my mom, but it's technically from my mom, but I say it's thrifted But I'm not gonna lie to you guys cuz I care about you, and I want you to know the truth. Oh shit I'm now in the carpool lane. Which isn't really fair because I'm just chilling here alone fam I am now here. I'm a little confused Sorry ummm Met my dad at that place, and it was great, but I saw a different place down the street when I was walking here That's a little bit more up my alley, so we're going there for me instead and then we're gonna start taking photos I love my life sometimes when we accidentally film people they Don't like it. So hopefully we don't have Are you like zooming in on me I Gotcha I kept my dad over here, and he's not even filming me the man has one job And he doesn't even you know enemy first let me tell quick story after it's done pumping my gas I put my credit card in my pocket right here once I parked I went to go find my credit card, and it wasn't in my wallet because it was in my pocket But I didn't know that so I start like low-key crying Maybe a little bit like I lost my credit card at the gas station And I'm screwed so I sit there and I start calling my dad He's not answering the spinning you cry a little bit more those like well I'm screwed like I'm gonna get towed or something then I reached in my pocket And there is my credit card and not it's a lesson of the game Just persevere because you will find your way to your credit card and the mats where your heart autonomy. Oh my god That was so inspirational The coffee's could Okay, just finished at the coffee place. We just found this and we're gonna take some freaking pics There's so many people around I'm feeling uncomfortable Okay these glasses look so ugly on me. I shouldn't have brought them. There is some person dead ass lately Pointing and laughing at me as if I'm an embarrassment to this world I have feelings it's somebody really laughing yes giggling at me, okay We're moving on from the frickin staircase thing because it smelled like a nail polish fart You never knew that that existed well here you go now nail polish mixed wits card. It wasn't cute, and it wasn't good so That is the saddest thing ever that is a literal chocolate croissant that could have been eaten by me Okay, we're at this cool vintage II kind of diner thing and next to it is like a record store That's not open which just sucks because it would be cool to go in there But it's still cool on the outside so for taking photos in front of this cuz you know I'm wearing some vintage 70s Pants today go to match the pant vibes. We need some nice vintage photo Opportunities, you know what I mean, but for a second before we take these photos Let's just talk for a second the last like I'm though our it's been kind of rough number one my outfit by hating okay I don't like it It's so ugly and it makes me sad, but we're working with all we have number two I finally got over the fact that my outfit was ugly turn my frown not upside down but like turned it to like a straight line at least then we walked to take photos in this like little alleyway and I see A squirrel that was ran over or maybe it was a rat I don't care its guts were all over the road I actually teared up a little bit because it's one thing to see like roadkill, but when it's guts are everywhere It's just like a little bit more sad then I watched a guy do heroin So I don't know it's been a little bit of a rough past like hour But we're gonna make it we're gonna make it happen. We're gonna go in there We're gonna go in there take some photos, maybe get some like coffee or something because I don't want diabetes sorry is that offensive We literally walked in and then they said no filming and you know what We're struggling we're really struggling today for me bad day for me, not good. This is real life guys Okay, not every shoot. Goes. Well. I'm sad also. I need to wear better outfits because this outfit fuckin sucks So my dad left he is going home now, but I decided I'd stay in the city today and just hang out It's only 10:00 a.m. Let me give you a little food haul I was gonna film in there, but like the security guards And they were freaking me out, and I didn't want to get arrested so I didn't film it there I got some nice avocado cucumber sushi Great two little things from urban remedy this first one is inflammation relief. It's like post like help you Oh It has pineapple ginger lemon Pineapple ginger lemon turmeric and cayenne in it and it tastes like shit. I also got mint cacao Chip smoothie it has banana almond milk cashew spinach mint pea protein and cacao nib in it so yeah I'm gonna eat this beautiful sushi now so I'll see you afterwards because this ain't no mukbang you feel me all right It's time to go home. I'm done. Oh shit wrong way. I'm tired. I'm emotional. I'm emo as fuck. Honestly the pictures today Weren't my favorite it happens it happens you deal with it We doin a u-turn right here, baby, that was so stressful I don't I'm having a little panic attack live footage panic attack of me live footage right now I did a u-turn and we're good I don't think I was allowed to do you turn there, but it doesn't really seem like I care do I Okay, so I just got ball. Let's change into some sweats one two three I'm gonna clean my room. I have all of these clothes to put away right here. No I'm gonna do that then I'm gonna make it a coffee, but first. I have to go pee so let's do that The lighting in here is freaking orange and tragic But when you guys subscribe to this channel you did not subscribe For good camera quality because we all know that that's not something I can offer I just feel like having a clean room is so necessary for life when my room is clean I feel like meet again when my room is clean I feel like I have everything in life under control and therefore. I love having a clean room I just think it's so important so I try to clean my room like every single day do I actually succeed at that no? It's always really tempting to just put these clothes into the dirty hamper even though They're not dirty because you know it's like well I could just put them in there, and then I don't have to put them away at the moment But that's just a temporary solution. You know what I mean. It's like put him away fam That's what I've learned in this life because you're gonna have to put them away at some point anyways you can't just keep Cycling it through the hamper. You got to put it away, and that's just that's the lesson of the day I really need another coffee. I've only had like one today, so I mean what can I say you know I? Don't even like this shirt, and I don't know why I bought it There's probably been so many time lapses in this video today because I've taken a lot of time-lapse footage today and like so this entire Video is just gonna be one big long time lapse so sorry about that Sorry, just me and BAE hashtag chillin oh My god Haha, I'm why can I not talk I jus I I need put on a hoodie. I'm cold BRB What So that's okay, I guess I accidentally activated it before I walked away I don't know okay, my life is kind of a mess. Let's try that again I'm so tired right now like I'm a rat Frothing my milk there. We go now we watch the magic unfold Sometimes coffee kinda smells like fart for some reason, but then other times It smells like Jesus Christ himself, so so it'll be confusing, but anyway Done okay, I'm ending this shit. I'm too tired for this good night"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-01-26T03:10:55Z,201222,5333250,9190,"What's up welcome to cooking with Emma episode I haven't done a cooking with Emma in awhile, I actually I haven't filmed the cooking with Emma in a while because, well actually, I did film one like a week ago. No like three weeks ago No like three weeks ago. No like two weeks ago. Maybe like one week ago. It just was so bad I just didn't like it basically so I didn't post it so I'm due for another cooking with Emma, okay And we're here today is we're gonna do a great one. I'm so excited about it. Today we're gonna be making these cookies I don't know what the name of them are because They don't really have a name. They're just like there. They're just there on a platter full of cookies They're always on there, but they're always like your third choice. um also I have my doggy. Awww I don't know. He's being kind of clingy today like he's been like really wanting to be on my lap a lot today So I don't know what I did to deserve that but I'm like not mad at it, so Subscribe if you love dogs look at him. He's so cute, but I'm putting him down You know I didn't you um I actually I know I've been noticing a trend whenever I'm having like kind of a hard time in life. You know life is just Treating me badly (Demonic laughing) I do cooking with Emma because I'd like to eat my feelings and today is just another one of those days I just ate like a whole bag of potato chips by myself ummmmmm Sorry mom, they were hers She doesn't know that I ate them all so she's probably gonna be pretty mad at me my dog really wants me to pick him Up, but I'm not gonna do it cause I'm literally Satan Did I even is this even the right Recipe this isn't even the right f*cking recipe so I have to go find the correct recipe because I actually have made this recipe before Yes, I know usually on cooking with emma I've like never made the recipe before but I've actually made this one before and I know it's good normally cooking with Emmas are fails And I'm done with that. I want a good one for once. I'm gonna actually be able to eat it normally I do cooking with Emma, and I can't even actually eat it because they turn out so bad They're like not edible BRB while I go print out a new one and all that shit So f*cking annoying am I right right ladies and gents? seriously unless that is the right one Hey guys update found the correct recipe Are you f*cking kidding Jesus Christ, you know there's always like a few different recipes for each thing And I basically just chose the wrong one. Anyway, So now let's get to work. See I don't even like need half of this stuff because the recipe was wrong anyway Sorry for the inconvenience Got all the ingredients. HI! let's line it... the Can you see my nipple through..?
 its whatever you know because I've made this recipe before and I know that it's good Today's cooking with Emma's gonna be pretty laid-back and chill. I've been having so many mental breakdowns lately then I thought that it might not Be a bad idea if I just do something that I know that I won't fail at sometimes That's important in this life, so I'm just better not to set yourself up for failure I tend to do that just kidding actually failing is very important in this life It makes you learn stuff but you know what we're not gonna get deep here because that's not what my channels about my channel is about I Don't oh, whatever Pam's our writer. What does that pulp? Is that a baking pan? Oh - baking sheet baking sheets are lined Cheers all right I love using a nice big bowl It's s T's a small bowl, but I feel like every time I use a small bowl it always overflows and then gets all over the counter And then somehow it ends up on the front of my shirt, and then it means that I can't wear that shirt Also, you can literally see my nipples through this. I'm sorry I don't want to get to monetize, so I'm just gonna go like this for the rest of it We all know YouTube's been really sensitive lately, and I don't want to you know nudity not okay While we're doing this let's just talk about life Okay, I should - because the flu is going around and it's deadly this year, so I normally don't wash my hands, but like squeaky clean Let's just I think I'm gonna link this recipe down below because normally I don't link it down below and to be honest I don't want to explain what I'm doing okay? That's a lot of work, and if you want to know how to make things that you shouldn't have came to my channel I never said that I was gonna teach you anything Oh, I need okay, if you want to learn how to do cooking there are many resources for you So don't come crying to me for some advice on cooking because I'm not gonna be able to help you with that and 1/2 teaspoon Good, it's a lot of salt you do what you gotta. Do it's spilling everywhere Sorry, mom. I try to make healthy recipes on here because there's more room for Expressing myself you why are my hands sticky like that? I just washed them my brain stop slow today You ever just have those days where your brain is just in a vegetative state Let me know they glued powder. I need to focus. Let's talk about life like it's a crazy thing We're probably looking in a simulation, but I've already discussed that before so we won't get into it God this is just inappropriate. I don't have to lean over like this with me anyways We're just a bunch of pixels these days I don't know, but if we are living in a simulation whoever is controlling my life do better Let's get out our whisk wait where the fuck is it? What the fuck I had to call my mom for this Be fucking kidding this bitch really testing me Well what I was looking for was in my peel box somebody sent me an electric mixer And it was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me besides the fact that someone else sent me a bagel Guillotine hold on you literally put your bagel in here And then you go like that and it slices the bagel another thing somebody sent me get ready for this I don't know how this just became a peel box haul but someone Sent me a mini ur whisk if you've been watching coming with Emma. You know we have the big whisk this big fat Hell then we have the mini whisk in my video walks up me Know somebody sent me a mini ur whisk this shit is so small it does absolutely nothing But it's so cute But I just can't stop using it if you send me This the electric mixer or the bagel guillotine you have a special place in heaven okay? And if anybody tries to tell you different tell them this Anyway, so that was my p.o box whole? Hour when greed rot our dry ingredients are done. Let's put them to the side now We're gonna do our wet ingredients hashtag stay wet and if you are allergic to almonds do not and I repeat Do not make this recipe because you will probably die this has so much almonds in it it has almond butter in it it has Almond milk in it and it has almond flour in it you could probably Also use peanut butter if you really want so keep that in mind Traditionally these cookies are made with Hershey's Kisses and peanut butter, but because this is a healthier version It's almond butter and dark chocolate. Do you want to know some truth? Don't me to spit some truth for you guys Hershey's chocolate is really bad. It's not good So Hershey's if you want to sponsor this don't don't sponsor me because I don't like your product unless You give me a lot of money The only people who actually like Hershey's chocolate are Americans and that's because they haven't had European chocolate They only buy chocolate from Europe this chocolate is from Poland because Poland does it better Mmm. Oh. Maple service so good. What a nostalgic flavor because when I was little I used to dress everything in maple syrup I mean not everything but like most things Now we're gonna warm this up in the microwave. Hopefully it doesn't explode Well, it's microwaving. How are you guys doing? Let me know down in the comments? This is also water by the way not coffee. I'll try and drink more water because it's good for me It's good for my skin, and I will be let's take the medium whisk okay This is kind of crazy this used to be called funky Why can't I can't okay? This used to be called the mini whisk but now this whisk is actually a mini Or whisk I can still call this one the mini whisk I'll start calling this one the mini our whisk case closed And then I'll call this so thick That's kind of stupid Okay, you call it the big whisk the biggest with the big e whisk I'll call so big E Whisk I loved making cookies because I feel like cookies you just can't go wrong with them like you just can't fuck it up I mean like I can probably pick it up, but like it's harder to fuck up cookies. Where's the tea spoon? I don't know how to read this recipe almond e as fuck I actually knew somebody once who is named almond bean if you're watching this What's up on the knees mixing it up and mixing it good with my? Mini whisk whoo I don't like it Now I'm gonna combine it I'll get down and dirty oh. Oh yeah, baby. Oh, yeah, sorry was that creepy. Oh my god I only put one cup and I only put one cup of almond flour in these did I put two cups in or just once? No, I put two in Did I know well, here's the batter let me take a nice bite That tastes right to me, what can I do these days you know and uh sorry I'm done, that's gross I need to clear my workspace. You don't care about this stuff cooking with them I used to be fun, but now it's just a hot mess You know what I mean. It's something that really used to hold a special place in my heart But now I'm starting to hate it so this might be the last ever cooking with Emma Let me know down below if I should end this Judas end it all Let me know Cuauhtemoc offense Go think so now I'm just you know scooping little balls and just putting them on you know this recipe is pretty simple and easy you know probably a stay-at-home moms who just Like to make pastries for your kids when they get home from school. You know those moms they just spoil their kids stuff for all those moms watching who are Learning from this this recipe is super easy and perfect for you if you've had a really hard day at Pilates And you just want to make your kids an easy fun recipe for when they get home from school This is just the recipe for you Maybe if your kids are home from school earlier or something they can even help you make this recipe family bonding time is Amazing for your stay at home mom self that's basically the only person who really watches baking videos right today No, mom they love. This kind of shit hashtag tbh Do you know what that's what we should never say again is tbh out loud I mean I do it all the time, so I don't know why I'm talking about it like that, but saying abbreviations out loud Huh why do we do that? I wish I didn't you know it's kind of gross Tbh like I hate that you know Maybe I should stop let me know how to stop doing that because it's really hard to stop fun fact about this recipe you actually Put the chocolate pieces on the top after it's done baking for some reason I don't know who made the rules I didn't before I looked at how to make these cookies I just assumed you put the chocolate on before you put it in the oven but like this crazy And so that's not the case put them in the oven I don't know what just came out of my mouth put them in the oven put them in the oven for seven to eight minutes Alright guys the little pups are in the oven. I'll see you in a little bit when they're out super young so yeah Then you hate with it, but like Voila So now I have to break up little chocolate pieces to put on top now most people use Hershey, Kisses But I don't want to do that we've already discussed why I don't want to do that because I have class I do have a little secret to tell you guys and I know a few you are probably gonna get mad at me so saying this and taking a risk this chocolate is actually not vegan Yeah, I know. It's polish, but it's not vegan with that said I understand the ears are probably very upset with me but listen they didn't have any vegan chocolate left at the store because yes vegan chocolate does exist if you live under a rock I had to improvise haha, and also it's not like they have vegan Hershey Kisses sleep as If we had to put improvised and you know what that's a life lesson in life. You got to improvise That's the lesson of the day take it or leave it people what can I say? Just really shove it in there. It's so satisfying. I love chocolate even though. I think chocolate makes my skin break out Let me know if that's a thing or if it's just me comment it down below and let me know Comment it down Britta this cooking with Emma was so bad, but we're working with what we have um You know it was either this or nothing so it's like you kind of get me yet. You know what I mean Let's try it Oh That was it for today's video. Hope you enjoyed it if you did I'm surprised you must have low standards I love you guys. I appreciate guys Thanks for hanging out with me today But I guess I'll just have to see you in the next one and we can only hope that the next one's better than this One, but at this point the future isn't promised peace out"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-01-22T18:11:31Z,111358,2793194,4521,"Hey guys I hope I'm filming good morning to you the birds are chirping Good morning, wait what is that from is that a vine? I don't know anyways. I'm sorry for that in advance Hope that you're having an absolutely swell day everybody hope that you're having the best day of your life every day guys Love you guys Hope you guys are having the best day so far today hope that today has been so good for you guys fam. Sorry We're back now good morning guys Okay, sorry about that quick hiatus Let's hope we don't hit this car and I didn't hit it today is starting out on a f*ckin awesome start today when I planned my day? I was like Emma You're not gonna f*ckin vlog you're gonna take a break and you're gonna take a deep breath And you're gonna take a fat nap and you're just gonna relax for a day then I decided no I'm not gonna do that I'm going to have a nice day But I'm also gonna vlog it because do you know what I don't want to skimp you guys out on a fun experience do you Know what I mean. I never want to miss out on that quality content basically yesterday I had kind of a mental breakdown we love those don't we have them a lot I know I do so I had a mental breakdown People are so rude. I literally cannot believe people in this life. It's crazy anyways I had a mental breakdown and it was okay though because I got out of it with a smile on my face I went to Denny's with my dad if you don't know what Denny's is it's like a diner, and it is interesting It's not bad. It's just interesting. I took these photos Those pictures are very post mental breakdown. It's probably pretty clear after that traumatic experience I decided that I needed to have a fun day, so that's what today is gonna be. Just a chill day I'm gonna go get food with my dad. We're gonna go to Judahlicious. It's so good If you ever are in the city and you a vegan thot go to Judahlicious. It's pretty good Then probably gonna get some coffee, then I'm gonna say peace out to my dad And it's just gonna be me alone in the city conquering life as a teen My god my eye is so itchy I might go shopping or thrifting or something like that But I don't know what I'm gonna do yet so just calm down. While we're on our way Let me just give you a little life update like let me just tell you what's up. What's going on. Number one I've been getting these little bites like bug bites on my body like on my neck and like my back I've been getting all these bites all over my body And I think it's because my dog has ticks to be determined not so sure yet I'll let you know yeah, I've been very itchy lately on my neck and my back Yeah another update Let me tell you a little bit more about my Denny's experience last night cause there was a lot to it going to Denny's It's definitely an interesting place to be okay It has a lot of personality I feel weird things happen to me while I was in Denny's There's a family sitting in the booth diagonal to me or whatever throughout my eating experience I was kind of periodically glancing over at them. I'm always glancing around to see if anybody's like I don't know trying to kidnap me I try to be aware of my surroundings The dad sitting at the table was eating like a stir-fry which I didn't even know that they had that at Denny's like that just doesn't seem like something that Denny's would provide and he was Eating this shit for a long time. From the time that I literally sat down in the beginning To the time that I literally left he was working on this stir-fry I'm not kidding this man was chowing down on this stir-fry for probably an hour and every time I would look over he had not made a dent in his stir-fry It was still a huge pile of stir-fry. Every time I look over. I'm like okay He must have at least made a dent in what you know he never even made a dent in it I mean I don't know if I feel bad for him or if he's just lucky or maybe he just takes small bites I don't f*ckin know didn't look like he was taking small bites. After watching this guy continuously eat his food and none of it disappear   This is what it made me think and I bet the FBI is gonna be not so happy with me if they hear me say This but I don't really give a f*ck. I think that I'm living in a simulation And here's why. It's very odd to me that some guy would be chowing down on his stir-fry for Literally an hour and make zero dent on it And do you know what that tells me that tells me he's he's he's a hologram he's not real he's just eating so like to fill my Surroundings does that make sense like he doesn't actually need to be eating the food because he's not a real being he's just a hologram In the simulation of my life, he's just chilling there fake eating food to make me feel normal, but when you look closer It's not normal because it's a simulation I'm hoping that someone makes a movie about me because of this discovery and if not I'm gonna be mad because people are praising Elon Musk Yeah
Well guess what I'm a ho that has proof want to know the proof never ending stir-fry all I can say is stay woke people because we're being lied to See that's really cool right it's like how I transitioned say hi dad Yeah, what's up everybody? No you need to show yourself Hey, how's it going everybody? We're here, my dad's holding the camera for me because I don't know I just like being a lazy Ho glad to be here the sun's out it's nice and comfortable no wind No wind. It's feeling good. You know feeling really good found a parking spot. Hopefully I don't get-Oh that was a dead slug. Why do we always see dead animals on these vlogs? There's another thing that's interesting about this every time we come to Judahlicious It's always a first or third Friday of the month, which means that there's no parking you know boring fun fact Let's see like it's not fun if it's boring Did you see that I mean, but nice try I mean hey go subscribe to my dad. He has a channel I'll link it down below. Yeah for more boring content come on over Go sub go sub people let's go get some food fam I don't know what I want I got a very Extremely beautiful acai bowl with peanut butter on top because I love I love peanut butter look how beautiful She is she's her own breed has a mind of her own Just finished our food it was great, I had an acai bowl. It was so good now We're gonna go to get some coffee from this place called is it Java House or Java Beach? Java Beach. Java Beach I'm feeling absolutely so great You should say say it again though, because there was a lot of shadows and stuff over there What was I even saying? Saying okay so we just had food. We're going to Java So should I just do that entire thing again? I You should then don't worry about it. No. I'll do it again. Alright guys. We're going There's a pigeon welcome to life there everywhere these days these pigeons aren't racist good night. Haha Did you stop filming Well because I had to I'm suing you I tell my dad one job I'll buy you a coffee just film me he turns off the camera can't believe the audacity of this guy Did he did you even see what I was just doing? Probably not. Probably didn't What I was doing was he couldn't see I was ordering coffee. You wouldn't know that would you? I love it I need to turn down the exposure Oh now I look dead I need to turn it back up. Over exposure is good because you can't see my under-eye bags See here's the thing about me. I have like genetically bad under-eye bags like when I was 4, and I had under-eye bags I just have them but when I don't sleep Then they're even worse and so then it looks like I got hashtag beat up for doing something like Buying drugs when in reality I don't do drugs. I just am tired and I have bad under-eye bags. That's just my life It's because I was up late watching YouTube I used to watch a lot of beauty videos fun fact about me like that was like my jam get ready with me videos and Like a lot of DIY easy healthy lunch ideas like all that fun stuff Where people would all make the exact same lunches every single person on the entire YouTube would make a video titled ""Healthy Easy Lunch Ideas"" in every single one of them made this exact recipe It's a tortilla with peanut butter on it And then a banana in it and then they roll it up and then cut it up every single person who made that video put That in it. Create it. Okay. I'm gonna stop before I offend people. Peace! Starting route to. Ah thank you so much. Then turn left onto 44th Avenue Turn left or right god dammit I can't hear anything. Oh shit I decided that I want to go do I decided I want to do a little bit of thrifting the thrift stores in the city the stuff is more expensive But it's like all the best shit deadass. I need to stop saying deadass It's starting to like really make me look bad deadass. I'm just gonna keep saying it Somebody's driving a matte black Lexus That is an interesting approach to life, but I respect it. I don't give a shit about cars I'm sorry if you guys care a lot about cars, but I think that cars are one of the stupidest 7 miles I think that cars are one of the stupidest Status symbols that you can have I think that cars should be praised based on how good They are for the environment rather than whether or not the Kardashians have them That's just my opinion so hate to take it there. I wish I wouldn't have but here we are Take it or leave it Sorry hybrid didn't mean to cut you off see because I just judging somebody because they drive a hybrid Or not a hybrid a Prius. Sorry. No Priuses are good for the f*cking environment so f*ck you You know what I mean if people are making fun of you because you have a Prius tell them to f*ck off because you're doing Good stuff for the environment, and your gas mileage is really f*cking good. I don't know just pisses me off. I'm just pissed now Thanks guys for Pissing me off. I was in a good mood before we started talking about this So now I have to f*cking find parking and we all know how that goes for me, and there's a f*cking policeman Hopefully I don't get arrested for doing nothing wrong because I'm a literal angel or whatever. I just found a spot I can't believe it, so let's go thrifting fam Ew I just spit all over you Hi, I'm back, let's do a haul I'm gonna be doing a haul. So the first purchase I made it's been a long time coming and I've been planning on purchasing some of these for a while But I just like it never happened. I got some black Doc Martens these are the softer leather ones because Um I'm a pussy, and I can't handle like the really tough leather it kind of makes my feet hurt And I'm really sensitive so I got these they're very cute. They're very cool Okay, this is actually really gross, but I don't care cause it was $5.00 This is a literal child shirt that has stains all over it, but I don't care for some reason I still think it's cool official GI Joe Club t-shirt, and it's literally a kid's shirt But it fits kind of cool like when you wear it. It looks cool It literally has stains all over it. The next thing I got I'm so f*cking excited about some of you guys might think that I'm stupid for this But it's so f*cking cool so I don't even care. Vintage 90s windbreaker Just look at this shit. Are you kidding me look at that? I'm so excited like shut up like come on I'm so excited next I got this weird jacket. It's like a vintage jacket that has like red white and blue I don't really know why I got this, but it looks like this and it's cool when I'm wearing it I feel like Elvis so I like that. Last two things I got Were vintage Nike top that has like cool things on the sleeve. I don't know just thought that it was cool Okay, so that's what that is I'm really excited about it. We're almost done with the haul so sorry if you're sick of it already so next I got a few pairs Of sunglasses because I'm just like really weird this wasn't from a thrift store It was from like a ripoff glasses place like they have all fake glasses, so their glasses are like super cheap I didn't film in there because the lady was kind of sketched out about it, but first I got these I don't know how I feel about these actually I don't know I think they kind of look cool Maybe not. You guys know how I am with my colored frames So had to add to the collection and I think blue is just cool because I don't really own that many blue ones like This shade of blue I don't know They're all so cheap They were like $7 each or something so I was like I'm gonna go ham and then last but not least we have these now these give me major, Elton John vibes, holy f*ck Last but not least I think this is an 80s shirt It said like I got it from the 80s slash 90s section in the store But this looks more 80s to me than 90s But what the f*ck do I know I just think it's a little bit cool. So that was the haul I'm going home It was a good day. It's like three o'clock, and I just want to get home before the traffic. It's bad because I just don't Want to deal with that so I hope that you had fun with me if you did good I'm glad love you guys appreciate you guys stay rad stay cool Be nice to your parents sass your teachers Yeah, that's it alright peace"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-01-15T01:42:04Z,103070,2913671,6458,"welcome to the most boring the most absolutely boring, contentless vlog you will ever watch in your life I'm telling you this will be the most boring vlog you ever watch That's okay I'm just I wanted to take you guys around my day today because I have a lot of errands to run- probably some of the most Tedious errands. Like the most- the most annoying kind that like exists for example: I bought some reading glasses that don't fit my head; cuz my head's too big They squeeze my temples so tight that it like hurts really bad, and I get headaches from them. Actually let me show you them So basically I already have a pair of glasses that I really like but I was like you know what I kind of want another Pair just to treat myself, you know for being a good noodle although These are cute, and they're kind of ugly after we return those we have to go to Lululemon and return some leggings Oh, but then last but not least most excitingly I'm going to get my hair redone because as you can see my roots are really bad See this is the most boring vlog look. I'm so sorry like this is just you shouldn't want to see this I mean if you decide to stay, thank you so much But I promise my next video will have a little bit more of something going on but it's going to be fun, to start of my day We're making some coffee, so let's get right into it It's not unusual to be alone by anyone also good news Good news is my mom ordered a milk frother So let me show you a little bit of that. Look how dope this is i don't know if you can see you can't really see any of it, and then it turns into foam it turns into foam! And then you're good Oh! Oh my god, it's so good Sorry, I hate to vacuum in front of you but, pick a straw and mix that boy up Yeah, that's one sexy latte thumbs up for me. Oh and you know what to spice things up a little bit, too I might even get lunch too. Just when you thought you know you were gonna unsubscribe or something Think again fam Fam, because we have a huge day planned filled with pointless activities returning glasses returning leggings Getting my hair done getting lunch. It's gonna be insane bro in the fucking membrane Do you know what, no. This is why today's vlog is not gonna suck because there's a little plot twist I have to return the leggings the glasses and get lunch all before two o'clock because I have to be back in my hometown By 3:00 so that I can get my hair done So then there's like a little conflict right because for all the good stories You need a conflict and a resolution and a rising action and shit. Yeah, I went to school Crazy right that's gonna be our little like Thing that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the video so that you don't click off. Please don't click off Please don't kick off. Please don't kick off Please don't click off alright. Bye Ha ha sup bitch Sorry, um I have a lot of zits right now, so ignore that one right here, so Painful dude it hurts so bad. Let's skedaddle kinda sad because I really want to be drinking my coffee right now But I can't because just brush my toofers and when I drink the coffee tastes like Ass let's talk while we're on our way to return the leggings and shit you already know We're doing I don't need to say it again while we're driving. Let's talk about some stuff I have a few things on my mind kind of number one see these new glasses I just got from Free People shoutout to Free People these were really overpriced the new trend these days that I kind of don't know if I want to get on yet So let me know you think down in the comments if it's like a stupid trend or if it's a trend That's a good trend mini little glasses I don't know okay i kinda wanna get some like little mini like little glasses. Fuck. Okay. Do you want cross the goddamn street, or don't okay? Hoe excuse you know I don't know I don't know Jesus Christ. Oh my-
 motherfucker running in the street with her fucking baby, bitch No, don't run in the street with a baby. That's just fucked anyway. Sorry about that, okay? I'm about to get hit by a bus now too, bitch we, we really also I don't even know if these glasses look good on me yet because I literally like bought them and then like didn't try them on And like this is my first time wearing them, so if I look like super fucking dumb right now, which I probably do I'm just like sorry I I just I don't know it's so hard for me to find glasses that fit my head shape my head isn't like that big but it's just like I Don't know it's round as fuck so it just doesn't fit everything you feel me. I don't know I just have a round head born with it What can you do it sucks? But you get what you get you don't be upset my head looks like a like a melon, but like more of a cantaloupe Cuz it's like kind of like really do you know what I'm just gonna stop. Let's have some coffee Let's see if my toothpaste wore off yet No it didn't that's the thing but I'm still gonna drink it. I put in a little travel cup cuz I really be that hoe If you're wondering I get really heavy highlights. I literally been doing it since eighth grade, so I just look better blonde I'm not I don't care. I don't care if it's summer winter fucking I don't care. Oh my god Oh, my god what okay? Sorry? I thought somebody ran over a squirrel, but it was actually just a stuffed animal in the road So I don't know how that happened, but anyways I don't know okay, but also here's another thing see I'm just like ranting about random shit But I'm sorry like this is all you're getting today. I don't have anything interesting to do This is what you're fucking getting I tend to have like oily hair like my hair Gets oily really quickly and easily or whatever so if you bleach your hair it definitely dries out your hair But my hair is so oily that it actually makes my hair like normal I don't have to wash my hair for like four days. It's so nice I hate showering I hate brushing my teeth. i hate showering. I just like to be fucking oh i dont know dirty, flossing? Oh my god It's too much. I can't do it anymore. It's not like we always did that shit. That's all new okay. I don't think homeo Sapiens picking out pieces of grass from the ground to pick out stuff in their teeth hell no Holy shit. That was kind of scary. I felt like I was gonna swerve. I'm using Siri to type this so mama You know how that is dead-ass we're using Siri out here in this bitch because we don't text and drive film, okay I'm gonna stop this now these glasses looks so bad on me. I don't know why I bought them. Okay? Sorry, okay? We're here honestly I'd bring my camera in there, but already returning. Shit is so awkward like I don't really have an excuse. It's just awkward It's like you go in there, and you're like. I like I'd like to return these they're like oh my god Why and I'm like because your product sucks No, I'm just kidding. I actually really like Warby Parker and Lululemon both so like it's not personal. It's just that they didn't fit me Hi welcome to were me Parker, uh-huh what brings you in here today may I ask well You know I really hate to do this But the glasses that I bought from here squeezed my fat melon head way too tight and I need to return that Please well our glasses weren't designed to fit melon heads like you, but I'll get you a full refund anyways. Uh sorry That's what I like is there anything else I can do for you. Yes. Give me a fat smooch I have two hours until I need to be leaving this bitch so that I can go get my hair done I hate returning things because the staff always seems so sad it just happened to be Literally the person who helped me pick out the shape was the person who helped me return them And so that's just even more sad because it's like he feels like bad. He's like oh wow I really fucked up like she doesn't even like the glasses. I picked out for her. I felt so bad so bad But now let's go return the leggings for some reason I feel less bad about returning the leggings maybe because it's I'm deep down angry At Lululemon because they freaking rip you off so hard like those leggings are so overpriced. Honestly, I see my camera shaking I'm just gonna end this clip because I don't want to put you guys through that I'm ending the clip I'm ending it the clip is over Don't jaywalk. Sorry anyways Hi, what brings you into Lululemon today first order of business get your foot out of my face, please Oh, sorry. Let me readjust oh Okay, I think that's almost worse whatever it's fine I'm in here today because I need to return some leggings that are a little bit too small I think your first mistake was buying galaxy leggings, but whatever I'll give you a refund hand them over Sorry All right is that it is that all we need ha ha yeah, that's it. Thank you, so I'm never coming here again What's up guys live from the freaking trying on room already returned the leggings now I like these 4 pairs, which I'm not gonna buy 4 pairs of leggings because I will be broke if I do that So I don't know gonna pick out which ones I want so hard to make decisions in this life, okay Wish me luck. I fucking-I hate myself. Do you know what I just did you want to know what? I just did I hate myself. I just bought all four of those leggings. I bought all four of them. I hate myself, but you know what I'm gonna do a fucking haul anyways please don't hate me for this Black leggings that go all the way to the floor because the ones that I have literally will not fit over my toe They're so small. I hate myself if I'm to recommend a pair of Lululemon leggings to you I would recommend these they're the align pant 2. They are so soft like okay. I got this color I hate myself these ones were on clearance it's like maroon with like this stripe down the leg So there's that I hate myself, but these are cute. It's bad for me I got these blue ones that were also on clearance. I don't like cropped leggings I only like long leggings which is funny because when I was younger I only liked cropped leggings crazy, how times change so yeah, so I did that and I'm mad at myself for it No regerts. I guess that was my haul. I hate myself. Okay, but on a happier note I'm really about to hit some cars right now so on a happier note, okay Sorry, let's try that again on a happier note on a happier You're not sorry if I see on a happier note one more time. It's gonna be bad for me I'm going to get me and my mom lunch right now from Asian box if you don't know what Asian box is it's so good Gonna get some of that for me and my mom because guess what it's only twelve fifty So I have time to get my mom lunch, too And then bring it home to her before I get my hair done really feeling like an angel this afternoon to do something like that It does kind of give me a stomach ache sometimes But it's like whatever you know what i mean to be completely honest a lot of things give me a stomachache riejriwmw a lot of things give me a stomachache I have a very sensitive stomach like I could literally eat anything and it gives me stomach pain There's probably something wrong with me should probably get it checked out, but doctors don't know what it is So sorry that got a little bit deep So anyways Burritos are so good like when I was younger I never used to eat them cuz they kind of scared me for some reason I didn't like the idea of like everything being hidden Inside of a tortilla, and then me like biting into something aimlessly and like not knowing what's in there I don't know why but that always kind of scared me and startled me, so I never ate burritos But then as I got older. I was like okay, bitch Let's eat a burrito, and then I ate one and I was like oh my god I can't believe where has this been all my life You know so yeah, so now I love burritos, but we're not getting a burrito right now, so calm down. We're getting Asian Box On a scale of 1 to 10. How shitty has this vlog been so far be honest. I hope I cut this all out I'm probably gonna cut it all out Emma if you're watching this just cut all that shit out. That was stupid uhmm and I'm fucking hungry. I need some food, baby, so let's go get it I hate myself should I get a to-go order and then do a mukbang in my car? Should I be that bitch even though I feel like those things are so gross actually I think that's what I'm gonna Do I'm gonna get it to go and eat it in my car so we can have a mukbang because we need fuckin content Bitch, I'm gonna get it to go and bring it back to my car I'm kind of proud of that idea ooh maybe I could do a mukbang Q&A like while I'm sitting here like eating my food I can like answer questions, Oh should I do that mhm? Yeah, I'm gonna do that that could be so fun like a mukbang Q&A ah let's do it, okay? Let me tweet right now follow me on Twitter if you want all the latest updates Hey guys tweet me weird ass questions right now. Let's see if people do it. I'mma add limited time only We'll see if we get any good questions to answer while I'm hashtag mukbang-ing well first We have to get our hashtag food. Can't wait to be a mukbang guru. I actually did a mukbang ones and It was so fun, so I'm really glad that I'm bringing that back to my channel hashtag swag hashtag BAE hash tag life Okay guys and welcome back to Emma's mukbang Channel *clears throat*, so let's get started We have the Asian box, we have some tofu veggies, rice. You know just the works I also got a coconut water because I was feeling a little bit spunky this afternoon Good. first question of the mukbang. Have you ever eaten or thought of eating? Chapstick when I was younger. I actually used to eat lipgloss often. I would eat lipgloss. I'm not proud of it It was like my favorite snack I'd get the lipgloss from Bath and Body Works, and then I'd eat it But this was when I was little okay. I haven't done this in like a long time, but in honor of that question Let's take a little nibble of this Oh, God *spits out chapstick* next question is what's your favorite kind of soup? Well, that's a good question I actually don't know I'm skipping that next question what languages can you speak I can speak English pretty well I mean, I'm not the best at it, and then I also took Spanish for like two years But I'm pretty shitty at Spanish as well so basically just English fam. You know. I'm just like not bilingual I immediately regret doing this mukbang because I don't like talking and eating at the same time I think it's gross that was just stupid on my part all of you guys asked me such good questions And I feel bad not answering them so oh my god How much do you regret asking people to ask you questions literally so much? I regret it so much because I feel bad because you guys spent your time asking me questions And now I don't even want to answer them if you could use only one chopstick for the rest of your life Which one would you use I would probably use Carmex or no Do you know why I would use I'd probably use aquaphor because although it's not that fun It's the most effective like Aquaphor genuinely like actually heals chapped lips like all the other chapsticks They like temporarily soothe your lips, but they don't actually like heal your chapped lips, but like aquaphor actually heals them So that's why Aquaphor is the best, but I just don't use it because I don't think it's as fun Will you marry me? Fuck yeah! Would you be friends with yourself if you were a different person? Hmmmm.... I don't know I cry a lot and like honestly well. I don't cry in front of my friends, but well honestly I probably would but I would just just because I'd feel bad for myself. I'd be like well You know this poor little human needs a friend, so I'll be friends with her But it would be a pity friendship does not even exist if that exists. That's fucked up How tall are you? I am in fact five four i feel like five four is a very average height. It's just very average How often do you shower? Not enough. Okay. Is water wet? No water is not wet! Wet is a sensation That's caused by water. Water can't be wet because water is the cause of that sensation. How long would you last living in Ikea literally? I think I can actually live in Ikea permanently because you have a shit ton of furniture and beds in shelter so you never like Whatever you're never gonna feel lonely because there's always people shopping in there, so you can just hang out with the shoppers You know and not only that they have freakin food there, too. Also. It's like fun. They also have soft-serve ice cream I mean Wait do they have soft, sir. I'm pretty sure Ikea has soft. Sir. Do you love memes as much as I do? Yeah, even though I always find out about memes like a month after everyone else and I feel left out But whatever your opinion was ranch originally made for putting on salad or for dipping vegetables in? honestly I don't really care about either because ranch I hate ranch dressing I don't think I hated something more in my life than I hate ranch when I see it I gag when I think about it,  I gag. I don't f--- with ranch and because of that I don't care about what it was fucking made for I just hate ranch ranch is so bad ehem ranch is not okay It's so bad. I know I'm probably offending many people right now, but I hate ranch it looks gross it tastes gross I just don't get it same thing with mayonnaise. I just hate mayonnaise Maybe they just don't like white things would you give this man a smooch? Oh? Lemme know down below Do you pour the milk or the cereal first definitely cereal first? I don't know that's just how my parents taught me to do it. That's it for my mukbang questions today I can't do any more. Thank you if you asked me a question, and I'm sorry that my answers were so boring it's just that I wasn't really in the mood to Elaborate about things because I'm eating you know what i mean? That's why I'm never doing mukbang again Cuz I don't like to talk and eat at the same time I have to go run home bring my mom's food to my mom then we're gonna get my hair done I'll see you when I'm getting my hair done peace love and happiness"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-01-11T23:31:12Z,93446,2130254,6227,"Hey guys *lathers on chap-stick like NO tomorrow* Okay we out here boy Hey guys, hahaha, what's up guys? I know you're probably like Emma You are acting way too hyped today like what the fuck's up with that fam, you know. I'm excited because today I'm gonna be doing a playlist video, and I know everybody makes *crackling of aux cord entering headphone jack* Holy shit. I know that everyone makes playlist videos and people are probably gonna be like Emma This is an unoriginal idea and we're unsubscribing But here's what I think about playlist videos because everybody has different Music tastes there can never be too many in this world and so today I'm going to be adding to the large list of playlist videos that exist on this platform, mkay I'm also gonna be doing it a little bit different because I'm gonna be telling you how these songs make me feel and why I Love them because I feel like people just show the songs and don't like talk about it You know what bitch, let's talk about this shit. It's rainy today I don't know if you can tell? Maybe, I don't know, can you see? Anyways it's raining. I'm bout to get in my feels, and I'm pumped about it. I'm ready my music taste You know not everyone might like it. It might not be everybody's cup of tea, but I don't really care I don't fucking care. If this isn't your music taste step outside of your comfort zone. Go listen to my playlist on Spotify It's called winter 17 cuz I'm a basic ass hoe. It's okay, cuz it's a fun playlist. Let's just get started Oh, yeah And then go follow me on Spotify if you want to, I really don't care up to you. My user name is Emma Chambie some people Say that they struggle to find my account and like when they type in Emma Chambie nothing comes up But I guess just do your best and see what happens Let's start out with my favorite song of all time. I'm dead-ass. I one of my favorite artists The Strokes I've literally been listening to the Strokes since I was younger. Now that I'm older I appreciate them so much more I'm so thankful for them It is art all the way through. There's like not one part in it that isn't so fucking good in there It's just so dynamic and beautiful, and it just makes my heart skip a beat This part gets me in my fuckin feels What can I say? I know y'all probably gonna come all up on here and be like Emma We already heard you play that song in your last last video. Shut the fuck up about it we know you like it, okay? Just in case you didn't see the last one like that song is so amazing you need it in your life Okay, whatever I'm gonna stop talking about it this entire video is gonna be about that song moving on I want to show them the newest stuff First just in case you decide to click off because you probably will cuz you're probably gonna get bored or I'm gonna start annoying you Or something, so I'm gonna go from the bottom up. Okay. You don't care. You don't care. So next we're gonna be doing another stroke song sorry not trying to make anyone angry. This one I just recently found and it's not something that the strokes would normally do okay It's not their normal thing, but you know what I fuck with it so hard It's so vibey, and you all know I am a vibe Queen okay. I thrive off the vibes Sorry, because it just fits every mood like if you're happy you can listen to it If you're a little bit kind of bummed if you just feel like you hate yourself. You can listen to it It's really versatile and that's why I like it. Let's play it now It's a little weird. You have to listen to it a few times to get it But, it's ok. It's about to get good! oh! It's so good! That songs basically proves that The Strokes can do every vibe. They can do a sad vibe a happy vibe, fuckin any vibe. Next we're gonna be doing a song by Rex Orange County. Rex Orange County is my new absolute bae guys You don't listen to Rex orange county, please listen to him He's so good like I don't know where he's been all my life And I have like four of his songs on my playlist now, so this is not sponsored by Rex orange county But yeah the first song they were playing by Rex. Okay, it makes me feel cute. no! It's like oh I don't know how to explain it it like just reminds you you know what yeah, you're just a teen okay? This is probably so nonsense to everybody about me, but that's okay because me everybody interprets music in their own way this is just my interpretation I Don't know whatever. Okay? We can agree to disagree on some things. Oh somebody's towing a rolls-royce and wonder what happened there That's not my favorite Rex Orange County song so let's show well we well. I'm not gonna show all my rock salons counties I'm gonna kind of spread them out because there's so many out on it make you guys bored Sonax his song my dad showed me it and at first. I was like okay I don't like this, but then I listened to it like 10 more times And I was like oh a bitch this shit is good. The song will turn your frown upside down hashtag guaranteed Trying to find the part, that's my favorite part I see something love this song I Really love it. Yeah, I do Next we have a nice Billy Eilish song I do like Billy Eilish, she's a savage She's a badass bitch, so let's just check it out shall we no wait oh I never said how this song makes me feel because that's a little point of this video And that's what's making it stand out from the rest because I'm trying to be relatively unique even though This is an idea if it's been done by so many people and it's very un-unique So let's talk about how it makes me feel this song definitely a little bit more emotional You know I haven't really had a breakup before because I've really never had a boyfriend because guys don't like me But if I wasn't going through a breakup, sorry, I'm talking really fast anything can be like you know what Fuck that guy. Okay, you know I'm so much better every girl You're gonna get after me will be in sound grade like that's how the song would make me feel Standing up for what you believe in okay? No. That's just stupid. Yeah, okay? This is my kind of topic But you know and you're like writing an essay and like you need like a thesis and you like just don't really know what to Write about and you're like the theme shows how you should stand up for what you believe in like and that's just like what everyone says anyway, sorry Okay this next song I was watching on Barla Catherine lookbook. I'll link it down below because that lookbook is spectacular It was so good. I was watching that lookbook and this song was in it, and I was like Oh my god That song is so good So I like found the song and it's been like one of my favorite songs ever since it's so good Please watch her love up to her style is so good. I just love her also She has this sweater, and I bought it because I saw her wearing it his son Just makes me feel like there's stars inside of me like it just makes me feel electric. Let's hear it I Thought you in power ranger right now after listening that song. Sorry. It's video is kind of long It's just said like I have a lot to say Now we're gonna do all of my favorite We're gonna do all of my favorite recs Orange County songs to the first one this song, holy And I have to think about how it makes me hashtag filled the hardest part because actually have to be like Insightful about how it makes me feel. That's a lot of work whereas everybody else just like lip syncs okay? I'm trying to be different so I sing so hard to this song I'm gonna hold back for this because I don't want any y'all to hear my voice cuz it ain't pretty you know But I don't just sing to every song if you owe me this song I have to sing to it because it's so good that like it takes over my entire body I can't even control myself when I listen to it. I'm like I feel like I'm being possessed by wreck He's taking over my entire body. He's just controlling me like the devil this song Just makes you want to live your best life makes you want to do it in jazz hands, okay? Next oh shit, there's a cop coming weights not for me. Oh my god. Oh My god so bad I thought that that cop might have been for me because I Accidentally ran over a puddle and it splashed so big that I thought maybe that could've been for me even though like I don't know If like running over a puddle is illegal But I felt like it might have been and maybe I was like maybe I'm driving a little bit reckless you know because I'm doing My playlist video, so I was like oh like this might be for me, but it ain't for me though Hey, deep breaths think about wrecks Orange County wrecks much tiny keeps me sane in this life cuz with me ladies and gents Another wrecks in Orange County, are you sick of it yet? Actually I've only shown like two of them I don't know why I'm overreacting this something also makes you feel kind of similar to the last one this song this makes you want to get on your feet and Just dance this song makes you just want to do a little jiggy jiggy. Let's just look meet you know I'm saying it just makes you want to bounce baby Well if you listen to a song and doesn't either make you want to cry or want to bounce Don't listen to it cuz I shouldn't wasting your time You Oh my god, okay, this song makes me want a bit. You know what I love my single life I do I do love it it is nice, and it is swell this song makes me want to base so bad I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. Okay. That's how I feel wow. I'm in like a really nice neighborhood, and it's Really rich, and I don't feel like I belong here should probably get out of here Okay, so this is another song that I've showed in videos before but I'm gonna show it again cuz I am apparently give notebooks because I'm a savage. I'm a huge fan of the growlers 100% I'm also parked now, so people are gonna walk by and it's gonna get a little bit awkward But actually do not I don't want to park. I don't want to park I want to keep driving because it's a little bit less awkward, and there's less likely that somebody's gonna watch me So I'm not parking. I'm leaving okay. Well there that one probably gonna regret that later. I love the growlers I'm not going to include too many even though I like so many of their songs because I kind of want to vary this because it's very easy for me to just be a Hoe for like one specific artist. Sorry. I've already actually in another video talked about how this song makes me feel No joke
There's something about the sound at the beginning of this song that literally just like it's the vibe that it's just like you feel like You can conquer the world you feel like you just want to go on a road trip you and just like get lost with like your boyfriend That's really fucking hot He's outdoorsy and he'll just like build you up looking like sort out of leaves and bricks and king of leaves you just want to like be free with nature because you are a Flower child that is just how the song makes you feel and like I'm just living for that fucking vibe so you're welcome I don't know why it's just so good to be stopped So I get a little bit carried away with that one okay moving on This song makes me feel like I'm living in the 50s even though like that doesn't really make any sense and like the song is Not from the 50s and like it doesn't even really have like a 50s vibe, but take it or leave it fan You know what I mean take it or leave it Don't know I like this song, but I'm just like sick of showing these songs to you And I need to start moving faster Because I really want to get coffee and like I'm just getting impatient even though it's like literally two degrees outside I say that's why it's like 40 I was like 50 not only that I also I'm gonna get an iced coffee because I'm a savage like that You know I do you know how I roll you feel me. I love that Next two songs our friends are by the walters really love the Walter It's definitely had like a Walters phase, but I'm kind of over it now But I like still really love them because I like really overplayed these two songs But I'm still gonna show them anyways cuz they're so good the first one so emo. Holy shit like so emo, sorry I'm not sure. I don't know why I'm talking like that That's so annoying I used to take a lot of naps listening to the song It's just a nice chill vibe you feel me. Why don't you think you feel me? That's so annoying? I'm talking like I'm a DJ or something. Oh my god. There's such a cute little coffee place I don't want to go there though because I would rather get Phil's butt This song is another one that kind of touches you straight up in the soul like you want to sing to this so hard you Want to seem to this so loud it's so cute. Why aren't all these songs about relationships. Oh god It's so hard being single listening to this music oh My god. I hate my life I guess the best music comes out of heartbreak am I right ladies Uh-huh and gents so good, it's stuff I already told you I make me feel, so let's just, uh wait did I? Don't want to die right now. Cuz there's like a potential here with this intersection That sounds hecka cute ay bro Okay, we're almost to the end next one is by the band Beach fossils I actually have a lot of beach fossils shop song inside this song is so good I Keep forgetting to see how the songs can make me feel them, and they start playing it And I'm like ready to jam out the name It said it honestly like I'm kind of running out of emotions to talk about like you know anything I feel I have talked about all the possible emotions And I feel like I'm just getting on creative at this point when it comes to that my foreheads also getting itchy because of this Beanie, so I'm not happy about it, but whatever That was so bad that was I think that was one of the worst Okay, I just have time to try to be unaffected by that and like what just happened to me I'm really gonna try But like that was probably one of my worst moments of people noticing me dancing because I was really hitting it hard right there She wasn't understanding though either like she wasn't like oh, I like that little girl 12 year old How'd she get her license? Why is she driving that 12 year old is really jamming out? Oh, that's so cute. It was more like all that 12 year olds jamming out. There's something wrong with her that was the look she was getting meek when something watches you and they give you a look and they're just like oh you you're Freaking weird then it hurts I've been liking these really like vibey like instrumental remixy things all of the songs make me feel the same way So I'm not gonna go into detail about it because it's just stupid because they don't make me feel the same way these songs Make me feel like I want to take a nap No these songs make me feel like it's raining outside, which it is right now, so you best believe I'm listening to these non-stop Right now because it is in fact raining Wow talk about in yo feels Yeah What's wrong with this parking spot, but it is so hard to get into Okay, next one is by Tompa beats this songs so good Baby"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-01-08T00:14:08Z,171414,4254239,7081,"Okay, hey guys, what's up, and good morning So it is 6:45. I was supposed to leave at 6:20 but I mean do you know what? we're all human aren't we? mistakes they happen and I made one today I'm only leaving like 25 minutes late. Today I'm going up to the city, San Francisco. I always say, San Francisco Just in case you don't know even though most people probably already know by now. I have no fucking gas - too I have to literally go get gas holy shit. This is definitely off to a rough start today I thought I had enough gas but apparently I don't so I have to now get gas as well. I'm gonna be very late I'm meeting my dad at a cafe this morning And then after that we're gonna go take some pictures whether I complain about it or not my ass is gonna be late So I'm gonna not fucking complain about it, and I'm just going to move on and grow from it also I know it's really dark out right now. It's because it's very early in the morning So you know how that is so I do have to get fucking gas, so that's so fucking sad. anyway but yeah as I was kind of saying earlier this morning did kind of start out on a rough foot I would say and I Woke up late originally, which is just the first problem It was hard for me to get up because I was so freaking tired even though it was only like 6 a.m. It wasn't even that early And then I sent out my outfit the night before then this morning when I tried it on I was like why is this so ugly so then I was like ok fuck can't wear this outfit gotta pick out a different outfit So then I took another like 20 minutes. That was my morning. It was a little bit Bumpy it was a little bit rough, but hey guys let's turn it around am I right. Yeah, let's turn it around Lets do it let's turn it right around let's turn that frown upside down right, baby It's kind of peaceful getting up this early in the morning And I like it so if you're wondering where we're shooting today and taking photos I was on Pinterest per usual and I saw a bunch of these Photos from a tennis court when I saw it I was very hashtag inspired and I thought it looked super cool Let me give you a quick little OOTD today because you guys get really mad when I don't shoes are converse Pants are brandy melville shirt is brandy melville jacket is forever 21, but I do like this outfit It's better than the first one first one was tragic, so I'm not even gonna talk about it But I looked kind of like a I don't know I just didn't look good. Okay. Don't ask any more questions Probably can't even see my face right now cuz it's really dark out. Can you let me know are you kidding me? I okay? I'm not gonna be negative because do you know what there's a lot of negativity on the internet right now So I'm not gonna add to it, but I'm kind of having one of those days where everything kind of goes shitty alright But let's turn it around I'm a human. Okay. I'm a human.

I literally don't know how– oh that's a problem I do not like pumping gas. It scares me. I feel like everyone here is gonna Try to kill me and it scares me, but I don't know I have like a little dry patch of skin right here not too fond of it to be honest also. There's a cop over there. Just fucking staring at me honestly I'm not doing anything wrong, but if he arrested me. I wouldn't be surprised because I'm just kind of sketchy you know oh my god. I'm getting a really scary look from that guy oh no no no he's giving me a scary ass look I'm trying to get the fuck out of here Let me get my receipt and just dip squad.

Let's see if it's any good It's actually it is kind of good espresso is a little bit sour But that's usually how rich people like it so oh you just spilled it on yourself a little bit But it's okay. My dad just spilled his coffee on it, so I guess that's what happens when you get older He's not gonna like that when he watches it back.  What?  nothing. the coffee is actually a solid seven out of ten Environment, ten out of ten. I mean look at this pretty aesthetic if you ask me we have the nice tiles here We have the nice wooden tables. We have the nice high ceilings a nice workspace. We have some greenery It's very rustic. I think it's great I think they really did a great job with the aesthetic one more thing about it. Is that the ice cubes are humongo. They're really large, and I like that because I think it looks cool (music) (music)   Hi Okay, um actually do want to hold this for me make my life easier wow this is good I could get used to this hands-free baby. Actually you know what it would probably be easier use your– you know what we got it?

Thank you so much! oh my god I just– we need to go No no no no they're getting off Wait It's so bad because normally when you wave   Normally when you wave They just go by so like you don't have to like interact, I just can't deal with that kind of confrontation sorry, I'm just nervous (music) (more nice music) (swagalicious music) (nice music right) (more nice lit af music) (nice music) (camera shutter) I'm just sad because I haven't pooped yet   No see this is why I need to do it This is why we can't have nice things (lazy town music) There you go *cringe* (camera shutter) Dab on the haters people Frickin, we're done here fam. first step put back on the poopy. It's just a crucial step I should probably trademark the name poopy jacket if you're using the word poopy jacket I will copyright it and You will be sued if you label a fluffy ass muh fucka like this and you put the word poopy in front Yo ass gettin sued. This is my pop socket. Not sponse definitely would recommend. I used to hate on pop sockets kind of thought that they're for weenie hut Jr.'s, but you know what I got one, and then I was like well This is embarrassing. It's actually really handy, so not sponse by pop socket because companies don't sponsor me But get a pop socket if you want Hey, there's teen boy on there, and he didn't wave to me you know what fuck you okay ow oh my god I just dripped over this frickin tree. What the fuck fuck you Christmas is over. Okay, so what we just finished taking pictures now It's time to get more coffee Download the photos onto my computer and just chill out so today Everybody we are going to be going to this okay Let's try this coffee I have very high expectations actually my expectations are just normal Good that we're just looking at the pictures they're looking absolutely Swell you already saw them because I include them in the vlogs because I'm generous anyways getting it back to editing these photos now peace out Peace peace out all right peace I'm gonna go to the bathroom now okay bye Wish me luck We're not going to talk about it Yeah All right almost back to my car. I have been here for four hours and its two hour parking Oh, we out here boy leaving. we did not get a ticket Wow we love good fortune. oh It's recording now. It's recording right now Oh Okay, cool. So are you– well you cant see me though. Yeah I can. really? probably. maybe not So we're gonna drop off my dad at his car at his car, and I just thought let's do a little carpool karaoke with dad No, no, no singing well then what else is it Just carpool sitting we don't have to sing here karaoke I thought if its singing– we're not gonna be singing oh, I hope I don't make a mistake Are you nervous? What kind of mistake? also wanna know something thats fun? I've had this in here for two months. it's gonna be like a coffee kombucha That's gross. I actually accidentally took a sip of it like two days ago, and it was like rotten And I literally like teared up just because I was so mad their little fluffy things at the bottom of the kombucha Make a right here I know that. sorry, but yeah, the little things that float at the bottom of Kombucha like there's nothing wrong with them But they definitely smooth me out a little bit. They're not like here to harm anyone, but they definitely hurt my feelings You know what I'm saying. It's a fungus right let's not talk about it. I have the worst hang nails hmm, I dont know what the solution for that is Do you want to know what I actually do when I have hang nails that are like really bad I actually put chapstick on them Oh that's a good idea No, it's not cuz it doesn't heal them at all all right all right peace. Let's starting route to home What the fuck alright so that was a fun day? I hope I'm even filming. There's so much construction going on around here There's something about construction that really stresses me out because I have like this weird like inner phobia of like Accidentally driving into like wet concrete and then getting then accidentally like getting Accidentally getting stuck in the concrete my entire car sinking into it and then me freezing inside of the concrete like my fears are irrational But I worry about it in my spare time, so I'm a little bit irritable to be completely honest I don't know why I didn't get a lot of sleep And so I'm just kind of irritable may be mercury is in retrograde or some shit I don't even know what any of that means, but I'm just not feeling like myself like I just kind of want to fight Someone not physically because I that's not my kind of type of fighting. I want to fight somebody Verbally I just kind of want to argue. I'm not normally this problematic Yes, actually someone just texted me, but I can't text and drive no texting and driving people don't do it even though I really want to read it like really bad I really want to know who texted me because I don't get texted very often so when I do I get excited. Okay I'm at a Stoplight. I'm gonna look. Okay. It was my mom. See this is why I don't get excited"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2018-01-03T01:10:53Z,101471,2966428,5587,"(Internal screaming) (internal screaming to the tune of ""take on me"") Good morning guys. What is up? It is? 8:55; Oh I thought it was earlier, okay well anyways Starting out my day by going to Phil's! do I even need to say that anymore (no we already knew)like it's getting old like I'm sick of saying it if I don't go to Phil's and Have a coffee and do some editing in the morning then the rest of my day is fucked up And I don't really know what else we're gonna do today because to be completely honest my life is so fucking boring Let's look at the weather. I never look at the weather. I just assume. It's 43 degrees right now That's so cold for me. Okay. I'm just a little California gal I don't really know how to what kind of like clothes to wear during this weather So it's like really hard for me my steering wheel is cold I need one of those furry steering wheels actually if I ever get one of those, please don't subscribe whoa whoa oh, man. Whoa whoa whoa? Some mom came out of her freaking driveway like a literal maniac hashtag disrespect I have some money and gift cards from Christmas from like my grandparents, and I kind of want to go spend it but like the problem is that the malls and stuff are so busy right now, but like It's so tempting you know think about gift cards that you have to spend them like cash I usually save it but with gift cards Like you don't have a choice You have to spend it because it's not like you can just like pay your mortgage with the fucking gift card for urban outfitters you Feel me that's what I'd like about gift cards Then it kind of forces you like go shopping, which I love because I love going shopping anyway, but it's like an excuse I'm like no like I have to spend $50 in Urban Outfitters because I have a gift card you know what I mean I love it.                                                               he   I am NOT going to be a basic beauty guru disclaimer Okay, where there like in the beginning of everything actually it's not even just beauty here. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to trigger anyone I'm just saying youtubers in general before every single youtuber starts their freakin video. They're like Oh, sorry if I said nasally I'm sick everyone says that why why I don't know, but it's very tempting like right now I sound nasally as fuck and I wanted to give you guys a disclaimer so bad I really did but I didn't because I didn't want to I don't know I know I you like you could clearly hear that I'm Congested. You don't need me to tell you you do not care about any of this shit. I'm so sorry I just haven't done a vlog like this so while or just taking around my dang fan. Oh my god See this happens every single day. Sorry this is off topic, but who surprised There's a street light and then there's like the Sun is right behind the streetlight So I can't even see what the street light says which is just really stupid Why am I literally craving no foods Comment down below right now what I should eat guys, and I'll read it right now And then I'll go eat wherever you guys say, so thank you for that if you come to down below Thank you so much eating yummy. Food is what keeps me grounded. It is what keeps me going? Okay, I'm saying probably cut all this out Why would you care about what where I want to eat why in the fucking fuck? Would you actually care about that you wouldn't and that's the thing I need to think about you don't care about it And that's the thing but it's hard for me because I care sometimes I care But not everyone cares also not trying to sub treat anyone But this game truck is blocking three parking spots that are right in front of Phil's and that I could actually Be using where at Phil's now It's gonna be a more fun after I'm done it Phil's because then maybe can actually do things that are have meaning to somebody besides Me debatable well, let's see how it goes peace love Happy happy peace love and peace love and happiness So you're welcome Okay, just finish at hashtag fills. I kind of had this spontaneous Idea to just go up to the city San Francisco about 40 Ended up about 40 minutes away from my house and just kind of hang out there because I was just like why not you know What I mean I'm kind of just in the mood to do kind of a spontaneous day So here's my plan while I was in Phil's I was yelping and trying to find a restaurant to eat at for lunch It was hard for me to find something because there's so many choices and I was like you know what I'm just gonna go to an area and just walk around and try to find a place so We're going to the Mission District I mean, I don't know if that has any significance to you But basically what I'm doing is I'm Oberyn or not we bring what the fuck why no. I'm not moving sorry I'm little bit stressed out. I got an email from a sweet gal, and she emailed me some pictures of some designs I'll insert a picture right here that she said I could use for my merch so I made the merge with the designs And they're for sale now these are not really great and very swag if you are interested if you want them or something I'll leave them in the description so you can go check them out and by that I'm going to buy some too fun fact I have to buy my own merch yeah, you would think that like no I would get free merchants as it's my own no, I have to buy it still I'm not gonna get into the logistics because it's Boring for me, and you, but there's some of my merch designs that I don't even know because like I don't want to buy them Which is kind of sad, but I'm actually gonna buy some of this because it's actually really good, and this girl is really cool So go follow her on Instagram for Instagram is at Brenda's zero that's basically it with that I'm excited though to have a little city day very spontaneous I haven't even told my mom yet, my mom doesn't even know that I'm going which isn't like a big deal But going to City is a little bit intense it's one of those things where it's like you gotta tell your mom There's some sketchy people in the city. I'm a young child not very tall get mistaken for a 12 year old boy Often I gotta keep my mom in the loop with this kind of shit trying to think I feel like did one other thing to Talk about oh well This isn't really Entertaining that the line for the Phil's bathroom today was so long that I literally had to hold my shed for 20 minutes and it Was so horrible why do I tell you guys about this stuff I feel so inclined But then sometimes people are like please do not tell us about your shit So I don't know if you guys want to know either way. I'm probably gonna tell you anyway What's up good been about 45 minutes no It's been about an hour since we last talked it took me like 20 minutes to find parking what's new sometimes I wonder like what? Would life be like if it didn't take me like two hours to find parking I don't know, but I ended up finding a really perfect parking spot now It's time to go walk around and find a restaurant. I don't know what I'm thinking yet I'm just gonna walk around and see one that speaks to me I normally rely on Yelp to find like my food places, but today. I'm going to rely on judgment I'm not gonna use Yelp so Yelp. Well. Do you know Yelp doesn't sponsor me, so I don't gonna do shit for the ass I just talk about Yelp for free so rude, but like whatever it's like one o'clock And I'm so hungry we need to get to work all right. We need to get to work I am so mad right now because the parking $6.75 per hour that's literally absurd But I don't even care gotta do two got to do an hour and 45 minutes. So that is 11 $15 um That's so offensive $11 I mean Jesus Christ the Lord You know I was gonna get some nice expensive vegan food, but after spending $11 on parking. I'm gonna get a burrito Um this burrito was $5 so pretty. Happy about that. We love a bargain don't we Wow she is beauty? She's grace I? Need coffee right now Back in the car wow what a day one an adventure, I'm going home now. I'm tired. It's 3:30. I'm done I'm done. It was fun. But you know what I need to get out I need to leave it was like it was a fun day, but I'm definitely just done I also kind of have to never might know if it's gonna tell you have to poop but I'm not gonna tell you that let me recap because some stuff happened that you didn't see because I was too anxious to Vlog it because sometimes like it's crazy, okay, and sometimes you can't pull out your camera in time as you saw I got a very cheap marinos $5 right so I got a really the route so I got a super cheap burrito Who's really good I've actually been to that place with my dad before and it's always been good So I knew I could go there and get a decent burrito ten out of ten would rack by the time I was done eating and everything. I only had like thirty minutes left on the meter so I was like okay. I should probably refill my meter just so that I have time to like walk around and get coffee if I want I was trying to find my Car to refill the meter and literally I could not find my color I thought that I could remember where it was but I couldn't so I called my dad and I was like stressed out and I'm Walking up and down the street like 10 times could not find my car literally 20 minutes pass with me Just walking up and down the street looking for my car I was on the phone with my dad Panicking then he had the bright idea that I should look at my vlog footage and see if I have like vlogs near my car So I could like see if there's any buildings or anything so the first time I looked at the footage I didn't see anything but then the second time that I looked at my footage I saw for a split second that there was a street number so I Yelp the street number and then I found my car, I don't know if that made sense But it was quite intense I literally had to like can't look through my footage to find where I was parked, but anyway So I went and I refilled my meter And then I went and I got coffee which was good and now I'm ready to go home So basically morale the story is logging saved my life because I literally would have never found my car if it wasn't for that footage Showing where my car was anyways very grateful shout out to me for vlogging chat as my vlog camera just for Capturing it all you know I mean imagine if I just like Lost my car like I lost it like what the fuck would I do if I just like misplaced it And I have to go to the bathroom But I didn't want to go to the bathroom in the coffee shop because the coffee shop was so busy There's so many people in there and the line for the bathroom is really long And I didn't want to wait so like now I have to wait thirty five minutes until I get home to go to the bathroom, but then I have the bathroom all myself so it's like totally worth it unless my mom wants to go to the bathroom that I don't have it all to myself because she's Gonna be using it. I'm happy that I came today Cuz I wasn't really expecting to do this like I didn't think that I was gonna come to the city today It was spontaneous But I kind of liked it because it makes my life a little bit more Interesting because I don't really do that much in my life I don't know I mostly just go to Phil's everyday like that's literally all I do so it's kind of nice to like do something spontaneous Like this it makes my life worth living it lay small that's kind of extreme, but it makes my life more spunky I'm not even just saying this to get comments because people do that shit But like actually comment down below what I should do in my spare time are there any hobbies I should pick up or something like should I like start knitting or like I don't know and going to museums Like I don't know like what do you guys do on the weekends okay? My camera's so jiggly it's pissing me off That's not gonna work. I'm taking this off well I forgot I was talking about but I had to take my camera down because it was jiggling and that was not okay with me I can't wait to go home and take a shit. I think I'm in the vlog right here That was it for today's vlog. I really hope you enjoyed. I really hope you had fun I love you all and I appreciate you all and I'll see you next time peace out   I love you a lot and use the right lane to take a slight right turn to merge onto us 101 south. Ok, thanks Siri"

- much love, emma chamberlain",2017-12-31T23:27:42Z,194257,4820965,14942,"I normally don't wear beanies But um my hair is oily as fuck so I'm ditching the beanie actually it just was kind of Hmm, I don't know bad vibes from the beanie Hello guys, what's up? It's Emma welcome back to my channel. Ew, I've never said that I have never said that and I'm not gonna start today Let's try that again. Hey guys okay, that's it. So, today we're gonna be doing a super uplifting fun, heartwarming Inspiring, beautiful video just to end off 2018 or 2017 don't get too ahead of yourself Emma. To end off 2017, I decided it would be kind of kind of cute if we just did a little uplifting video to warm the hearts of the People you know today, I'm going to be reading my hate Comments, this is so unique probably seen a bazillion people do this before I've even done this before if you want to watch it It's linked down below Check it out if you want to you know a lot of you were like don't bring attention to the haters like whatever But you know what I think that reacting the hate comments is Healthy for those who are receiving the hate comments because it makes you be like do you know what? They're probably right so today, I'm going to be reading specific hate comments, not just any comments Let me explain so recently I did a podcast with my friend Cody and Kelsey love them both to the moon and back Actually, do you know what, the Sun and back and it was loads of fun I had many coffees before I was extremely hyped. I was excited. I was pumped I had fun I talked at a hundred miles per hour And it was a lit ass time some people didn't really like me so much. You know what don't don't cry because Hold on. Don't cry because it happened Don't cry because I haven't smiled because it happened don't cry because it's over smile because well, then okay Don't cry because it happened smile because it's over no wait Don't cry because people are hating on you smile because you love yourself Today I'm going to be reading the hate comments from that podcast quick little hashtag Disclaimer actually I mean I don't I fucking hate YouTube disclaimers They rub me the wrong way, so I'm just not gonna do one Let's just get started there were an alarming amount of comments Just saying that I'm a little bit annoying Which I understand in this context because I will link the podcast down below. I was a little bit amped Let's just see what we have here Jesus. She's fucking annoying okay. Holy shit. This bitch is annoying Yeah, I'm 12 minutes in pretty clear She's gonna hijack the entire podcast fuck this tried skipping around wherever I landed. She was being annoying well. I gotta tell ya you know Okay, I think she's kind of annoying. I don't know she talks a lot If you think about it, I mean I'm not trying to roast you I ain't no RiceGum okay ow fuck how annoying is this bitch well I think it just depends on the day some days. Oh my god lock the doors and throw me in the street I feel bad for my parents because I am just annoying but other days. I'm chill. There's a lot of variables here How many coffees did I have did I have three? I'm probably gonna be annoying if I have zero coffees how annoying am I gonna be? Still annoying moving on from the annoying comments There are only about ten of em And then the rest were just a lot more mean I used to be afraid of being called annoying like that was my biggest fear But then after reading the other comments I realized oh annoying is the least of my worries this girl needs to calm down if you know anything about Females actually do you know why I'm gonna get hated on if I just say females if you don't know about human beings in general When you tell them to calm down, it's just like 'ZOINK' they go off the next line of comments We got was about an illegal substance is she on coke now I would make a joke and act all naive and be like oh are you talking about the drink no? I know you're talking about cocaine and you know what I'm sixteen years old, and I am a child of the Lord That's actually a joke I've never been to church I need to stop making these Church jokes cuz I'm just offending more and more people and I'm so sorry One or two coke comments would have been funny there was like 30 of them is this bish on coke, okay? Don't try to act all hard and be like you know talk about drugs, and then use the word bish Are you five years old use the word bitch throw some balls ya pussy I'm sorry is this Emma girl okay? She talks so fucking fast. It feels like she's on coke With Emma on cocaine okay forget an 'E' there ya stupid hoe. Sorry, I'm gonna try to be the bigger person here I'm kind of hating on my haters. They don't deserve hate They're already probably having their own inner demons that are just running amok So I'm not gonna add to that let me try that again was Emma on cocaine oh, honey number one no I was not on cocaine but number two you forgot an 'E' sweetie. You forgot it was that better trying to be nice I want Emma's coke dealers number shit must be straight from Colombia haha You should be a comedian I bet Saturday Night Live is looking for someone like you bet that comment got like four likes cuz like everyone else was like oh Is emma on coke you came out here, and you took the creative approach? I might as well just hand my channel over to you take over You're a creative god so moving on there was another little chain of comments here And I took offense to I consider myself a hipster. Haha don't know about you I listen to indie music. I wear glasses Sometimes I even wear beanies. There is a little bit a controversy about my hipster shit Emma The schoolbook millennial. Okay, wait I think that I thought that like millennial and hipster means the same thing and I don't think they actually do okay Do you know I think all Millennials? He says are hipsters right ladies and gents see I'm a millennial Let me take it to the step further I bet we can all agree right guys Oh, I bet we can all agree right people's peeps right peeps anyways. I think that Millennials There's no such thing as a schoolbook millennial. We're all just taking our lives one step at a time I'm taking this fucking shit off actually do you I know I have to keep it on cuz it's like part of it none of us are the same we're all different role taking our different paths and Standing up for what we believe in and we're also really sensitive, and that's why I'm offended by these comments She's kind of pretentious, lol We get it you're edgy and original with your taste in music and shit I bet you listen to fucking I don't know Bon Jovi You know what learn from me? I try to step outside the box and you're calling me words such as Pretentious and what do you mean? Lol we get it you're edgy and original with your taste of music and shit, okay? Actually wait do you know what? Hold on this bitch is actually trying to compliment me. She hates me she hates me But She did say that I'm original with my taste in music and shit So do you know why I'll take it moving on from hipster shaming uh-huh even though I am a hipster It's kind of what I do on the weekends like my weekend job during the week. I'm just a normal teen on the weekends I'm a goddamn hipster blub the podcast watch every single one, but absolutely fuck this basic ass bitch I feel like I'm in high school again listening to this entitled bitch. Go die in a forest fire this one You know what I mean this one definitely kind of and this one really hurt my feelings Called me a basic ass bitch, which as we've discussed earlier. I am very much a hipster Offended they called me an entitled bitch But then last but not least told me to die which is a little bit extreme Originally when I first read this. I definitely took it to heart you know I mean they really hit me at all the soft spots vulnerable spots I read it again, and I realized they don't even know how to spell the word entitled I'm pretty sure I learned how to spell that in fifth grade and At least spell shit right because I want to be able to take you seriously next time there's a forest fire I guess I'll go jump in it for you. Thank you so much as you can see there are some trends here There was a lot of things that people were Specifically calling me out for and another one would be my use of the word like I'm aware that I use it a lot but It's a helpful word. It's like I Just said it right now I'm a teen I'm a Relatable hipster teen and we only use the word like because I'm that's just what we say these days like Okay I'm gonna stop like like like like like like like like shut up you uneducated Bitch that comment kind of sounded like something I would say Hahaha someone count how many times Emma says like ha ha ha ha that's so fucking funny. Holy shit you know what would be even better if we made a Drinking game where every time I said the word like someone took a shot bring this to your next high school party I'm telling you everyone will be drunk by 8 p.m.. I'm surprised no one came up with that down in the comments I am so surprised. No one came up with that Oh wait, huh? They did come up with that, and it wasn't just one person It was like 45 fucking people fun drinking games drink every time Enema says the word like enema enemas a fluid injected into the lower bowel by the way of a rectum Also in another note if I had to take a shot every time Emma said like I'd die In the first five minutes of the video LML in within the phone LMAO. Love you girl wait what the fuck Love you, too, girl. Okay. No sorry about that one. Um take a shot every time Emma says like Take a shot every time Emma says like to euthanize yourself That's a little dark and last but not least this one's actually the most creative one. I've seen yet Take a shot every time Emma says like Moving on her voice makes me want to hurt children You know what this actually works really well for us all I'm a child so you can hurt me and then my voice will go Away, and you won't ever have to hear it again, her vocab seems O be limited. She just makes sounds Do you know what I need to learn from you fam because you just used a word I didn't even know existed You seem to be advanced to a whole new level that I haven't even experienced in my lifetime yet Maybe even my fucking dimension. You must be on a whole nother damn dimension. You just use the word O, just O as its own goddamn word and I didn't even know that you could do that I don't even know what it means listening to Emma talk makes me exhausted. Ah the classic I tire you out good luck when you have kids. Oh wait you probably won't because you're an asshole glad. I watched this Okay, I don't know why this comment got like mixed up in this slide. I watch this I know not to check out her channel. That's where it is Don't check out my channel you fucking pussy Don't check it out cuz guess what you just got featured so don't check it out cuz you got featured so like you don't want To see that do you pussy? Okay, can't wait to be done with this my self-esteem is so low right now You know what fuck you actually my self-esteem is at an all-time high. I'm fucking really tall really good-looking really athletic I fucking love myself. I love me I love me if you want to listen to an annoying child there we go with the annoying again But that's the least of my worries remember for an hour and a half. You've come to the right video well Joke's on you stupid hoe. Sorry. I forgot him being nice joke's on you. You're funny friend there it is I'm gonna call you funny friend from now on this is a podcast not a video Jesus fucking christ mouth diarrhea as fuck i'm seven minutes in and I need to take a break It just means that your brain. Can't comprehend a lot of words at once. It's not my fault. Oh my god kid stop talking had to stop this podcast her voice hurts my ears. It's not that bad Geez this girl needs to slow down within the first five minutes She went through an entire phone book yowza slow your voice down whoa whoa whoa back up the presses not only Did you just use the word phonebook, but you also used the word yowza and they're next to each other Do you know what this tells me this tells me that you are a 50 year old mother? You are a mom go tend to your children go talk about phone books and yowza at your goddamn book club Also, is that really a good influence on little Jimmy? You're the one who's fucking out there Yelling at other kids moms because the kids are saying the f-bomb in front of your little Jimmy well look at you You're not any better telling me to slow down Telling me I went through the entire phone book and this video would be 15% shorter without the word like this whole like shit I'm over it, but you know what I like. It's like I Just said the word like, like 10 times here's a funny thing I actually commented on the podcast and said like the quirky Queen. I am three coffees before filming This wasn't the best idea because I'm right it really wasn't the best idea luckily. I got some responses on it Yeah, you didn't know when to shut up. Do you know what I mean? I would use the phrase say it to my face, but they just said it to my face okay last But not least this comment is not a hate comment this comment. Just really wraps it up And really takes it home. Who is Emma Chamberlain, and why is everyone freaking out about her good point to answer your question I'm nobody and People are freaking out because I say like so much apparently this is all for hashtag jokes fam. I didn't take any of this personally Even though I'm reading these comments and even though I've seen a little bit hashtag salt gang I try my best to look past these and only pay attention to the nice ones and those ones really pull up my heartstrings and I Just love all you Sweetie pies out there, ew, and if you leave me a nice comment you are not on my shit list these people on the other Hand they're on my shit list and when I die. I will haunt them and I don't know move around all their goddamn furniture anyway Well, I love you guys Appreciate you guys. Thanks for supporting me because you know what if it wasn't for you guys I would read these and probably cry myself to sleep. Oh wait. I did that anyways. Thank you for being you. I love you hipster out."

Very early, very dark. So I'll kind of talk more when it's a little bit brighter out so that you can see my face, even though you probably don't want to see my face. I'll see you when it's a little bit brighter outside okay. but just know that I'm up this early, like just give me some credit for being up this early. Write this down in the history books that I am up this early, probably won't ever happen again, but now that i got my street cred, I'll see you when it's light outside okay. Yo, sorry for the sh***y a** lighting it's super red and weird as f*ck. I haven't really told you what I'm doing yet so let me tell you that now. So I'm in San Francisco today, early in the morning, apparently, because I forced my father to do a sunrise photo shoot with me, because I'm pushy and I like having instagram photos to post. We're meeting at Philz. Gonna take you along with me today VLOG LIFE Okay, well we're gonna turn left now so, I mean right, okay see this is why I'm stupid F*ck my life okay, well anyways. Sorry about that guys a little bit of technical difficulties. Holy sh*t people hate me. Oh my god I don't know where I am. I'M SO LOST. F*CK! You don't even know what we're doing yet and I'm already lost. Oh my goodness gracious, it's going to be lit and it is lit every single day, bro. I haven't had a coffee yet today so I'm really glad that we're meeting at Philz this morning, and I also haven't been to this Philz in this area before. I usually only go to the Philz near where I live so, always like to try new things. But first I have to get to Philz that's the thing, and so I'm close but you know what? You're never, but still just a little bit. Just *snort* a little bit confused. I will see you when I get there. I'm excited to take some pictures because I have kind of a fun outfit on. I'll give you a quick little OOTD. My pants are from Brandy. My shirt is thrifted. My jacket is from Brandy. My hat is from Forever 21. Glasses are from Amazon, these were literally my Napoleon Dynamite glasses for my costume so that's kind of funny. I was really sad because on the way here *GPS: In a quarter mile, turn left onto Folsom Street* Turn left or right? Okay, this is why my life is hard. Sorry guys you're just gonna have to stay down there for a second. I really wish I could prop my phone up. So I just have to hold it like this like a freaking weenie hut junior and it frickin sucks. *GPS: Destination is on your left* Okay but now I have to f*cking find parking and I have no clue where to go to for that. I have no clue, where to find parking. Okay just wish me luck I'll see you when I'm done with all this shit. Okay update. After lots of hard work. Dedication. Grind. And just overall, just really putting all matters aside and just prioritizing finding a parking spot, I found a parking spot. We found a parking spot. Actually-- there's my dad. He has his camera because I'm forcing him to take photos with me. That's what it's like to be related to me. It was so hard to find parking and it's so busy, and people hate me. People don't like me on the roads People are not the biggest fan of me. Maybe it's because I drive like a grandma I don't know up for debate. But this is really off topic, but I ate pasta last night before I went to bed, I literally ate pasta at like 12 a.m. and then I woke up this morning and I'm still full from eating pasta and I hate that. I hate that, I'm never gonna eat that late at night again. Just feeling a little bit farty from the pasta. I'm gonna cut that out, that was gross. So um it's not easy to say this, but we're kind of out here boy *giggles* We in these streets you feel me? We out here we in these streets you feel? I don't think I can say that. See this is why I like having my dad with me because I'm not like, filming, from like a double chin angle. He can film for me at this nice angle. He could have held the door for me. I love cocaine. *giggles* She is beauty. She is grace. *giggles* She is Miss *giggles* She is Miss United *giggles* No. Let me finish. She is beauty. She is grace. She is Miss United-- United States. They're playing Beyoncé in here and I am uncomfortable. She is the queen and I just don't even feel like i deserve to be in her presence. Do you know what I mean? All right, I just took a fat sh*t. Now let's go take some pictures. It's where I live, it's my lifestyle. I don't know. This is just my lifestyle. Crossing streets, being in these streets, I don't know keeping everyone on their toes, just my lifestyle. Some people they might hate ya. Others they might love ya. You just can't win around here alright and that's it. I'm just feeling so much like me now. I had my coffee. I took a sh*t. I am at my absolute best right now! I'm just feeling alive as f*ck. I went to bed at 1:00 a.m. woke up at 4:30 or something or 4:45? I don't know. Slept for like 4 hours no like three and a half hours. But I'm feeling woke as f*ck. I'm feeling pretty woke too. Woke and broke. ME TOO! Okay I just farted. But you couldn't hear it. Sorry I know You, guys, want me to start farting on camera but that one wasn't loud enough, oh my, god All y'all must come to
San francisco to look at this yeah to look at the golden gate you're sleeping on the bay bridge  because no one out here looking at the bay bridge everybody out here looking at the golden good because everybody's like, nope, we respect the bay bridge I mean, I'd say the pictures are going pretty well i kind of feel like i've to shit again You know that's kind of what caffeine will Do to you but besides that, would be really great i say we're heading to the ferry building, what favor ahead the ferry, okay?

Oh yeah, we're, gonna the ferry building because, my, dad's making me tell you that because he likes when i include Context and setting in my vlogs Now it's time for a story About the ferry building. i used to work down here and i used to deliver For dhl i used to go into the ferry building everyday And the place was a virtual dump. no i can't tell it's an inappropriate story, sorry kids Wha- Wait, why, hey, you can't just do that! I used to use the restroom in there and all over the walls like they Would write with magic, markers like they were looking for dates.

My eye's a little swollen. Hey guys!!! WhAt'S uUuPpPp?!?!?!?! Ok stop that. Sorry this light is like not good with glasses. Maybe I'll just take them off. Well um, it's not that noticeable, but this eyes a little bit fat and swollen. Pray for me, let's hope I don't go blind. Today, we're gonna be making the ultimate chap stick Let me explain. Somebody either tweeted at me or commented somewhere that I should make a chapstick That's like a combination of all my favorite chapsticks, and when I saw the comment I was like that is f*cking genius. So today we're doing that. Let me lay out the game plan here We're gonna go to Target. I'm gonna pick out a few of my favorite chapsticks Maybe six... maybe five. Then I'm gonna come home And I'm gonna basically remove all the chapstick from its packaging whatever and put it all of it into a bowl Microwave i.t, mix it up and basically create my ideal chap stick. For some context, I f*cking love chapstick I am a huge chapstick gal. Applying constantly. It's my Lord and Savior I literally worship chapstick on the weekends like catch me on Sunday like literally like bowing down to f*cking Carmex I love chapstick. It's what keeps me sane. It's what keeps me grounded It's what gets me up in the morning, and it's what puts me to bed at night It is my favorite thing of all time, okay? The thing is I like so many different chap sticks. I like a wide array You know all these f*cking brands right? I like them all for different reasons I thought it would be pretty f*cking genius to just mix them all together and make one master chap stick that is curated specifically for me I recommend you try this at home. If you're a chapstick brand out there And you want to pay me to talk about your chapstick, just let me know fam I'll do it for you, but you have to pay me a lot of money *happy music* *HAPPY MUSIC INTENSIFIES* ooohhh aahh OH YEAH B*TCH *Emma continues to dance and sing weirdly in car* Coming to target two days before Christmas... not the best idea, not the best idea *Emma continues to dance and sing weirdly in the car* AAAAHHOOOHHH WHY DO I DO THIS TO MYSELF? I'm back, and I have all of the things that I need Let's discuss. First we have to start out with a little chapstick hall with explanation First let's start out with chapstick brand classic cherry. You gotta stay true to your roots here This is what I started with, this is what I started my journey with. it's just an OG fave a It's just it's a cult classic So this one will definitely be making its way in here. Next we have some Burt's Bees.Now Burt's Bees... I use a lot But I don't even actually like it that much because it's not as like goopy as I like I really like goopy chapstick, but despite. We got some Burt's Bees here. You know what I still like it It's just that it's not my fav, but it's like Some Nivea. I love Nivea this one I'm pretty sure smells like cake. Okay that it doesn't smell like cake that's disappointing But Nivea is very moisturizing very fun so we will also be putting that one in. What I noticed when I was there is that number one: chapstick is really expensive and Number two: they don't have that many options, and it was really upsetting But we have some Vaseline I love Vaseline it's also a classic you can't go along with Vaseline this one's the one with cocoa butter so Last but not least as you guys know I am a huge Carmack's b*tch And this is the spread here We have Carmex, Vaseline, Nivea, Burt's Bees and chapstick... NOT SPONS!!!! So let's just jump right into it Let's just put it in this whole Nivea tube F*cking love that. I'm already having too much fun. OH! YASS! This is something... I've always wanted to do like being somebody who loves chapstick one of my goals in life has just been to like empty all of them... Out and um I'm making my dreams come true right now, so that's very very exciting I don't think I've ever finished the chapstick like ran out. I lose it before I can like run out Oh my god, that's too much. That's way too much. So I have a few concerns... Let me share them with you. My main concern is that because these are all different flavors that it'll kind of be a gross Flavor when they're all combined I'm especially worried about this cherry one because I know how cherry is. It's very pungent you know and so I'm a little bit worried about That because I feel like you know what if like it makes us all together And it ends up smelling like you know I don't know pink diarrhea. I don't know what could happen oh Okay, that's just not gonna work. Oh this cherry smells so good I feel like it's it smells like cherry medicine, but it's so nostalgic that like it's just like fine cuz it's just vibes you know I'm gonna use these two for the final packaging I'm basically gonna refill this into these does that make sense? I really hope it does because I'm not I don't know I just hope it does. Let's go warm this up in the microwave Bye buddy, I think we're gonna do let's do 20 second intervals I just warmed it for 20 seconds and nothing happened. Okay. We're gonna have to put in for longer Do you know get I'm putting in for 60 this time. Hopefully. I don't burn it is that possible I mean it probably is can't wait to finish filming this so I can go eat a snack So Everything's nice and melted It's a little chunky, but I'm okay with that. Everything's good with a little chunky. Chunk in it. Let's smell it That literally smells like burnt rubber like that's actually that smells like you know like what you like slam on the brakes really hard and then you're like rubber like burns on the asphalt or whatever and it like makes marks on the road like skid marks or whatever and Then afterwards there's a smell. That's what this thing smells like. Do you know what? I spent $20 on chapstick I spent f*cking $20 on all this shit, so I'm just gonna make it work, and I'm not gonna ditch this video. I'm not gonna Just end it and act like this never happened even though. It's tempting and I kind of want to do that Okay excited to be back a little bit concerned But you know what it's fine because everything that's good in life always causes a little bit of concern in my right ladies This is the fun part fill er up fam we get to fill up the frickin chapstick Okay, this actually is not fun at all. It's not fun at all um okay. It truly smells like rubber I don't know how that happened. I don't know what I did to deserve that I'm not happy about it I'm not giving up quite yet, because I feel like there's so much potential for this to be overall a great creation You know I'm not gonna give up on her Okay, also, this is so oily like it's gonna. Take me years to get this all this oily off my hands I'm gonna go put these in the fridge. I'll see you in like 30 minutes when they're Frozen you know or not frozen, but like when they're like solidified and not melted anymore. Okay, bye fam We're back We have the chapstick my eyeballs have like a literal reaction while I was off-camera this I like the nerf gun Affected eye got just super irritated and red And it was just stinging so bad and then next thing I know I'm rubbing it and then it just got worse and now I look like I'm crying or Maybe I am crying, and I'm just trying to come up with an excuse you won't ever know um no. I'm just kidding I'm not crying. I'm totally fine I'm totally good. SMELL As I said earlier it smells like gasoline it smells like literal gasoline burnt rubber tires gasoline It smells like a f*cking race car f*cking park. It smells like a f*cking race track. But let's actually try it out. Oh It's a little bit chunky. It kind of feels like you're rubbing sand on your lips for some reason Which I'm not a fan of so this one is going straight in the trash But this one no this sucks, too. It's just  f*cking - it's chunky This was such a f*cking fail. See - I'm having an issue here. This kind of looks like I have big boobs Doesn't it. Maybe okay, maybe not I think no okay anyway well I'm kind of having an issue because I used to be a DIY queen every time I try to do something like this I would Like to succeed um lately that has not been the case also. Let me wipe off I don't even want it on my lips. It's shitty. Oh those are going in the trash I used to be a DIY Queen. I'm no longer a DIY Queen like that was a fucking fail Don't do that at home. Do not do that at home. Just buy the chopsticks individually No need to combine them all. I'm so sorry that this is what I'm giving you I'm so sorry that this is the content that you're getting from me something that you can't even use I'm just not meant for the DIY life I need to give up I need to stop trying, but I always come back, and I'm like you know what this time I'm gonna kill it this time. It's gonna be it's gonna be good this time, and it's never good. Also. I'm wearing pants I promise I'm just wearing shorts with the turtleneck my mom turned up the heater to like 80 degrees in our apartment So I had to improvise, but yeah anyway, I'll put my leg down, but that's it for today's video. I'm so sorry I'm just so sorry about all of it. Yeah it's a fail. It was a fa- It was a big fat Squishy fail, but I hope you had fun. I didn't have fun, but I love you. Bye"

It's ahah Emma *beautiful vocals* ""ehhmmMa"" Sorry, I'm so sorry. If you're watching this the day that I'm uploading it, it is Christmas Eve, Merry Christmas Eve I'm wearing a green sweater, spice it up a little bit for the occasion Yeah, I hope you're spending time with your family, having the time of your life. So for today's video, I wanted to make it very spicy and special because it is in fact Christmas Eve today And I didn't want to just skimp out, you know what I mean (like i did with my clothing line) I could easily just skimp out and be like *deeper voice* ""ohh, I'm not gonna upload today 'cause it's Christmas Eve And I'm spending time with my family,"" *normal voice* no fuck that, you know what I'm uploading today because Christmas Eve is a day to celebrate And here I am for you right now. We're gonna be having a sleepover. Not just any sleepover Christmas Eve themed sleepover Let me elaborate, when I'm filming this it is not Christmas Eve So I'm just faking it, BUT the night before Christmas is fun as f*ck so let's just get right into it *squeaks* ♪ I just want you for my own ♪ For our first activity we're gonna be decorating some cookies, because Santa loves cookies. You got to please the man You know what I'm saying, or else... you ain't get nothing for Christmas. You feel me. I bought from Trader Joe's this ugly-sweater Cookie kit, it's like you get to decorate these little cookie..whatever. I'm just gonna fucking open it I'm excited because it's not gingerbread. It's just regular sugar cookies. This is the first year I've seen Trader Joe's do something like this, and I'm ecstatic. Pre-made icing. Thank the literal Lord I made a video a little while ago making a gingerbread turkey And it didn't come with pre-made icing you had to make the icing yourself, and it was a f*cking hot mess. Oh my god It's literally so *gasp* Ohhh My god. I hate my life. I can't believe this is happening to me *gasp* I can't believe that this is happening to me. Okay. I'm just gonna keep going I'm just really thankful that they realized that that was an issue and gave us pre-made frosting We have a cardigan. I f*cking hate cardigans. We won't be using that. Hideous vest. Bonus... ugly Hawaiian shirt Thank God for that even though that doesn't really make any sense. Well I guess it does because in Hawaii it's like hot during Christmas. Whatever. I don't care. Atrocious turtleneck okay Let's just talk about that for a second um I would just like to chime in and say that that's extremely rude Whatever the f*ck, let's just get started, no one cares So okay obviously because as we all know I just had a rant about Turtlenecks it's very clear that I am a fan of turtlenecks - so lets make a turtleneck first Or should we save the best for last? I don't care. Oh shit that smells good Where the fuck oh do I have to cut the tip Oh. This whole year, I just haven't really been on that Christmas hype. It just wasn't for me. Call me ""Satan"" I am so sorry for all who I offended especially you Santa. Pull through anyways. I don't even know what I'm doing anymore Okay, this icing is extremely dry. I mean I guess it's what you get when they give you pre-made, but still I'm having PTSD from sucking my mom's nipple this frosting is so f*cking good. Holy shit I'm actually really excited to eat one of these cookies it kind of matches me. not really. Let's eat one Oh wait no I can't eat this I'm giving it to Santa he won't mind if there's bite taken out of it. uhhhhhh Wowww good job Trader Joe's. That's a f*cking good cookie, and I know a good cookie when I taste one *emma's dog barking* Shut up. That was fun, but I need to make a few for Santa. I think I'm gonna make three for Santa That motherf*cker don't need all of these! If I made all of these for Santa and if he ate all of them because you know how Santa he eats all the cookies that he gets you know I don't want to make the man bloated. He's already bloated He already has literally every kind of unhealthy eating induced disease like the last thing I need to do is like, I don't want to add to that. The guy he's gonna die any day now. His cholesterol I don't even want to know so we're only gonna make him three. I'm trying to put him on a diet this year I don't want it. I don't know he's already thicc okay. I know all the cookies Just go straight to his ass apparently we're gonna make him a cardigan. Old men love cardigans We'll make him a vest. Old men love vests. And you know what? Let's make him a Hawaiian shirt too just for like when He's passing through Hawaii, or like the Caribbean. I don't know *pronounced differently* Caribbean is it pronounced Ca-rib-be-an or Care-uh-be-an? Let me know down below comment down below how to pronounce it Let me know hahahah subscribe to *gibberish*. just fucking subscribe while you're at it. ahhhhh First we're gonna start out with a Hawaiian shirt. I'm trying to make this have like a flower on it. no this looks bad *slurps* Okay, don't tell Santa I did that *vvvvrrrooooommm* Is someone literally street racing outside of my apartment right now I can literally suck on this like it's a nipple for the rest of my life That's bad for me. I shouldn't be eating this much sugar ohhhh I forgot what I was talking about, okay I really want to eat this one, too But I'm not gonna eat it because as I said I need to save some for Santa and whatever okay This is the first one. Let's wait for it to focus come on. Let's focus. okay Do I need to put my hand behind this motherf*cker. is it focused or no? I can't see the camera's too far away from me. Well. It's um it has some flowers on it. Merry Christmas motherf*cker. I don't care *background music* Next we're moving on to the cardigan, I hate cardigans I don't think like I don't even know how to decorate this because I hate them so much you know cardigans kind of give me PTSD from elementary school I feel like all creepy elementary school teachers wear cardigans. You might see your mom wear a cardigan to church I wouldn't know I don't go to church. Do I look like I go to church to you. Anyways see like this cardigan It's already coming out bad because I can't make it look good because there's no way to make cardigans not look ugly I wish I had some Christmas stories to tell because like you know then it would be like aww like we're having a sleepover We're decorating cookies together and like telling stories But like I don't have any Christmas stories to tell you so sorry. This cardigan literally is the worst thing I've ever seen. I'm just gonna rub it around with my finger And hope it-oh, did I even wash my hands? No, I didn't oh my god I just remembered that Santa's gonna eat this and like now I have my saliva in it. Santa honestly put me on the goddamn naughty list. It's where I belong I wish I belonged on the naughty list But I don't do anything interesting enough to belong there does that make sense? Comment down below if you belong on the naughty list Yeah, okay, low-key, low-key though, this cardigan low-key is kind of dope. Okay? We got to put the hand behind it though I'm sorry like I'm not even.. Do you see it? I want to eat it so bad but I have to save it for Santa! *background music* Do you know what I'm gonna suck from this nipple again, this kind of looks like period blood. Sorry *slurps* Ohh. I'm gonna make this vest really funky. Um I don't know how I'm gonna do it yet, but let me brain storm Hmm. Okay, definitely want to do some red in this one. First We're gonna cover the entire vest with red is this a tutorial. No. This is a sleepover and not a tutorial I don't know what I'm talking about. My hands are literally gross like I don't think I've washed them at all today Like even when I pissed earlier like I don't think I wash them afterwards But I stay rubbing my finger in this. Honestly though Santa is like low-key mystical as f*ck I don't think he's gonna be mad if my saliva is in it cuz I don't even think the guy can get sick He's too magical for that. If his thicc ass can slide through the chimney. He can somehow magically avoid my germs Okay, why does this look like a bowling vest? Or maybe golfing? What does this look like? No, movie theater guy. This one sucks. Do you know what I'm gonna Do some-no fuck this we're making this shit plaid I actually low-key love plaid like I kind of high-key f*ck with plaid. People like are sleeping on plaid That's all I have to say like I low-key high-key. Mid-key. High-key, I high-key Low-key like I literally high-key Love like high-key like a little bit though, but like middle-key, but like I low-key like high key Though like low-key though high-key though but like really low-key But like high-key love plaid. Such a favorite fall vegetable. Plaid is a fall vegetable that you should be eating this Christmas at your dinner table. Plaid is a look, plaid is a vibe, plaid is in and plaid makes me want to scat *slurp* Wow, if I suck on this nipple one more time  *slurps* ohhh! Why do you do this to me? This is bad? *fart noises* Okay, this is one of the lowest points in my life. *more fart noises* Oh that was too much ah no Here's the fucking plaid vest. Here's my hand behind the vest, enjoy the vest. Santa if you're watching this, I worked hard on it. Yeah, asshole *background music* I put our beautiful cookies on this beautiful plate *Uh-hm* I cannot wait for Santa to just scrumdily dumdily eat those up into his tumbily (tummy), but we have more we have to do So Next to go along with the cookies here We have to write a letter to Santa and I know you're probably just thinking. Well I don't think you're thinking anything 'cause they think that everyone does that. Not everyone does that. Write a little something to Santa. You know what I mean? Show my appreciation for him He's been looking out for me all year. He is my Lord and Savior. Sorry is this getting too personal? Let's just get writing. ""Dear Sant-"" You know what, this paper, this white paper. I'm bored of it. I think you'll like that a little bit better *Christmas music* The letter is finished, I'm gonna read it to you guys real quick. Okay, let's let's read it *clears throat* ""Dear Santa, you trick-ass bitch. I've been extremely thick this year, and I know you've noticed. It is clear you have also been thick this year, yo' ass fat as hell. Give me Team 10 merch or I'll burn down your factory. You stupid hoe. Suck my dick, Emma."" If you're asking me, *deeper voice* I think he's gonna like it. *normal voice* These things together. I don't know I think it's gonna be a winner *Jingle Bells audio* Okay, now you know I started to kind of forget. This is sleepover with Emma. You know we're having a sleepover I can't have you guys go to bed hungry. We have to make some dinner. At first I was going to make a bagel, but then I was like ehh no I make too many bagels in my videos I just I need to move on then I was like maybe I'll make some pasta and I was like welll nuhh I don't know. Not so sure about it, and then I started thinking and I'm like you know what during the holidays We're all eating very shitty. You know lots of cake, lots of cookies, you just saw me scarf down that cookie earlier like it was nothing. Yeah, that was scary *rock music* I think it might not be a bad idea if we make something a little bit healthy, so let's make a smoothie for dinner tonight Okay, let's make a smoothie Frozen strawberries, honestly do this at home. Add some lemon juice and new years are coming up I bet all of us, one of our new year's resolutions is going to be *clears throat* be healthier. New Year's resolutions are stupid if you want to change something change it in the moment. Don't wait until New Year's to change something, but anyways *dog barks* Can you just keep it down? *barks more* shh Shh so yeah Everyone else starts their healthy New Year's resolution blehh everyone starts that January first well guess what motherfuckers we are starting ours December 24th. Queen. We're starting ours early because y'know what, we don't wait *blender* Ohh I have a f*cking cold sore inside my mouth, and this is so acidic and it hurts. I shouldn't have made this I mean, I'm gonna still drink it, but like *Christmas music* Okay guys, so now it's time to kind of start chilling out I know that today's Christmas Eve But we are having a sleepover meaning that we do need to do a few traditional sleepover activities. Now what is one that you think of when you think of a sleepover activity? Truth or dare. Obviously I'm here alone because I don't have any friends, so I'm gonna download an app. Let me screen record I don't know how the f*ck to do that, but I'm gonna learn. Truth or dare app. Should I do adult? 'Cause we're adults, right? Truth or dare free party game contains age restricted material *sucks in* OHH UHH NUHH Okay call your mom and tell her that you've signed up to audition on American Idol next year, okay Hi, um just wanted to tell you that I have *laughs* Signed up to be on American Idol next year.  ""shut up"" It's just not even funny because, because you know I wouldn't do that ""So you're serious?"" No yeah, I'm serious ""No *laughs*"" Okay ""After your singing today.."" Okay, you're making me upset. I need to hang up ""Noo *laughs*"" I'm filming a video and it's like I bought-or I like got a free truth-or-dare app and this was one of the dares ""Oh got it"" How fucking stupid is this *laughs* Okay, bye. Okay, so that was f*cking stupid Call one of your siblings. Okay, so I don't have a sibling. Thank the person facing you, wapow! funny. this sucks ""I'm an adult virgin"" this app f*cking sucks, truth or dare is canceled Next activity we're gonna be doing is face masks and story time because you know sleepovers are a time for pampering stories and gossiping with the gals I don't have any tea to spill, but I do have a story to tell about a sleepover but first Let's get on a face mask I don't know why things like facials and like painting nails and like shit like that is like traditional like sleepover activities But why is that? why wasn't it like? I don't f*cking know playing Mario Kart I feel like I've actually played Mario Kart at a sleepover so maybe that's maybe. never mind. You know what I've always wondered though? What do guys do at sleepovers? *laughs* Like what do they do?! Like what do you think they do? If you're a boy watching this, comment down below what you guys do at sleepovers. I would love to know. Do you guys gossip? Do you guys talk about f*cking like 22 Jump Street? like I don't know what boys talk about. okay So now that we're back in bed. We have a nice face mask on. Um it's time to gossip So I think it would be fitting if we talked about a story that happened at a sleepover A sleepover story something that happened to me at a sleepover. Summer of 2012 I have summer camp with some of my friends. After summer camp one day We all decide to go to one of the girls house. girls'? and we'd all have a sleepover after camp It was a day camp. It wasn't like a sleepover camp It was like we would go like during the day or whatever. And it was really fun I'm also really nervous because I don't think that the person who's I'm talking about? I don't think that they know that this happened. If you're watching this and you connect the dots. I'm so sorry in advance I just I'm a changed woman I wouldn't do this again But let me just finish the story first we all decide that we're gonna have a sleepover and of course I'm excited because ya bitch love sleepovers Okay, you know we do the normal stuff; jump on the trampoline, eat snacks, and then it's time for bed Okay, I'm about 11 at the time so we go to bed and everything's all good everything went very smoothly We brushed our teeth we got in our PJs, and then we lay down in bed and went to sleep we were all sleeping on a blow-up mattress in the living room and IIIIIII Am dreaming. I had a dream that I was in a humongous mansion. I'm talking about like Team 10 house mansion I'm talking like JLo and Jay-Z. wait are they married? oh no it's Beyonce and Jay-Z. Like Beyonce and Jay-Z mansion looking ass head ass motherf*cking ass I go and I Find my way to the bathroom in this big mansion and I take a piss in my dream I was pissing in a toilet in my dream. Well when I was waking up I was also pissing in real life, and this was not my bed You know I'm 11 it's now the point where peeing your pants is now embarrassing so I pissed my pants I was so f*cking scared it's like 4:00 a.m. I feel warmness on my leg, and I reached down, and I'm like ""f*ck I pissed myself"" I get up and I look at the bed, and it didn't seep through to the actual bed It was just in my pants. Which is a big deal to me because that means it's easier to cover-up I go to the bathroom, and I just take off my pants, okay This is kind of getting TMI But whatever and I just start washing it in the sink because I just don't I just don't I want the pee out of my life, and I was not planning on telling anyone, okay I wasn't gonna tell my friends that I peed the bed I was not gonna tell her mom. I didn't want anyone to know. I wanted to figure this out on my own I did not want to tell anybody. Luckily I had a change of clothes in my bag So I was able to change into my pants that I was gonna be wearing the next day So I literally went back to bed wearing jeans they didn't even notice the next morning that I would literally woke up and got out of bed already wearing jeans. Uh they didn't notice thank God or maybe they did and they just didn't say anything cuz they'd wanted to spare my feelings. To make a long f*cking story uh sure, I think what I ended up doing was.. okay This is kind of when the story gets a little bit interesting. I was not actually Wearing my own PJs, but I was wearing her PJ shorts. I, if she's watching this and she knows who she is, I will feel so bad that she now is hearing this She, you definitely know who you are if this is you. Um I'm so sorry After I rinsed the shorts and they were clean of my piss anyways or at least as far as my 11 year old self knew. I Put them at the bottom of her laundry Hamper and just kind of hoped that they were forgotten about until the time that it was time to do laundry So I basically hid them in her hamper umm Am I proud of this, no. Should I have told her mom and her? yes. Because then those shorts could have been you know washed sooner because rinsing them in the sink doesn't really get all the piss out umm *Christmas music* i don't even fucking know what reindeers eat *music continues* Alright guys It's Christmas Eve. We wake up tomorrow and Santa's gonna be here literally love Santa so much like I literally have missed him like I know that he's really unhealthy and like he probably has like a Lot of diseases because he eats so many cookies But like I really hope he likes the cookies I left him and I just really hope that the reindeers like really like what I left them and yeah, I just love Christmas Eve And I'm so happy that we could spend it together at this sleepover. *dog barks* I bet my dogs are barking at Santa. It's fine. Guys It's just Santa no. It's just Santa it's fine See I knew they'd calm down. It's gonna be hard to fall asleep, but I think we can do it Do you think we can do it? Fall asleep tonight? You know cuz it's Christmas eve Santa's coming ahh I think we can go to bed right now cuz like it's so late. It's like 8:30. Yeah Okay goodnight guys Do you want to talk about our feelings *music* Let's go see if santa came. Oh my god. Do you think Santa came? Let's go see if he came, let's go see if he came. Oh, he ate the cookies Umm Is this my letter? Oh he left me a letter. Let's see what Santa wrote back Um I don't see any gifts here, but maybe he just like left them in the basement or something. He does that sometimes You ain't even naughty or nice. You just a fat loser lma*yawns* Lmaoo, ps your cookies were shitty I've seen better from a third grader suck my reindick What the f*ck is a reindick PS reindeers hate broccoli hashtag educate yourself hoe.

I'm using the dream brightening dreamy concealer, Maybelline As you can see my hair looks like a rat's nest and you might be like EMMA WHY IS THAT THE CASE?????? and that is because I forgot my brush at home sooooooooooooooo 2day we need to go buy me a brush because I literally forgot it at home How stupid OH wait this isn't that bad (she's talking about the beauty blender) I think the first time I didn't I didn't soak up enough water with it. So it was like really dense I've never tried a real Beauty Blender, so I don't know what that's like in comparison, but pretty good *emma squeaks* We need to get breakfast and coffee We're just gonna go to this place called 'Creation' And I always see people who live in LA like post about it and stuff, and I was like Oh, maybe I'll go there and just be that gal, you know- bare minerals blemish remedy all these products are just I feel like everybody in the beauty community, they all wear like the same products like they all use the same like Laura Mercier powder or like I don't know that because I'm not rich okay, so I don't own that shit And I feel left out with my fricking bare minerals like I don't know anyone who used bare minerals tap tap tap You know what I mean, and everybody uses the Tarte shaped tape no more your with my frickin whatever, but it's fine I like this guy *scream* NEXT we put on the highlight. I'm not gonna be contouring my face today because I don't know how to do that I take so much highlight. *EXHALE* I love to be a glowing GODDESS We like to be glowing out here boi. Last but not least, we apply some mascara. But as you guys know I hate wearing makeup, so I don't know why I'm doing this. But you know, I do- there's some times, there some days when you just kind of wanna wear some makeup Maybe if you're feeling like your skin looks like shit. Aka me right now actually when does my skin not look like shit Good point. I'm using the Too Faced better than SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEX Masc- oh shit squeak Despite common belief I actually do like watching people do makeup like you know like I lowkey may or may not be like James Charles Stan, kidding I actually do like his videos though But whenever people use this mascara in like beauty videos younger girls or boys they're like betterthansexmascarea I don't know I just think it's funny They don't want to get to demonetized from saying the S word you know what I mean OW i jus fuckin pinched my eyeball x2 that really hurt.

It's 8 a.m. This morning was rough for me waking up wise I literally like could not wake up I've been trying to wake up since 7 a.m.. I just kept pressing snooze. I know I'm a relatable teen I have a lot of shit to do. well, let's backtrack. today I'm flying to LA City of Angels City of angles because I have a very excited activity plan I got the Blessed Opportunity to be on Cody Ko's podcast with Cody and Kelsey. They're not extremely excited about it They both have YouTube channels and Cody has a podcast you probably already knew that you definitely already knew that But I just you know what for the one person out there who doesn't know there you go On like Monday this week, she texts me, and she's like can you come on this weekend and I was like Ok I literally booked my flight like on Monday, which is I'm not a very spontaneous gal, so like for me I was like holy shit. This is kind of wild like you know like this last-minute trip I was like, but it was not a question when she asked me if I'd be on it this weekend I was like oh, I will get my ass to LA I don't know how I'm gonna do it, but I'm gonna do it so I basically just booked a flight And that's how I'm doing its not that big of a deal we have an flight at around 11 also I'm just excited to hang out in LA because I don't know like it's been kind of cold around here in the Bay Area And there's a lot of good coffee in LA that's fun. You know what I mean. I'm just pumped about it I was packing last night and next thing. I know it's like 3 a.m. No, hey, that's a lie that is such a lie next thing. I know it's like 2 a.m.. Nope That's also why next thing. I know it's like 1 a.m.. That's more like it, and I'm like shit I'm not even done packing like I and I had to stop because I have neighbors and they'll get mad at me if I'm packing past a certain hour Pounding on the floor my mom loves being really early to the airport so our flights at 11:00 And we're gonna be getting to the airport at like 9:30. Oh my god i didn't even show myself pouring the coffee I'm so sorry, but here it is now (nice music while emma stirs coffee and a cough) Starting off May morning with a nice bagel you might be like Emma. Why do you only eat bagels? I do eat other things that aren't bagels it's just that they're boring and so I don't show them I think that bagels are a fun thing to show (crunch lol) Thank you everybody (emma getting lit) All right, I think I'm done Let's do a little quick travel OOTD shall we these pants are from PacSun this striped navy turtleneck is from brandy poopy jacket is from forever 21, okay, do you know what one two three four five Literally, what did I do to deserve that like I've been doing everything. I need you I've been cleaning my face I mean washing my face. I've been washing my face. I'm putting on all my medicine and this shit still happens to me I don't know. There's no way to win in this life My mom's driving us to the airport today So that means I'm not in my car and guess what that means there's no fucking chapstick My lips are dry as hell. I feel like I'd literally dip my lips in water. Anyway. Just absorb all the water ew Are you lighting up a blunt over there sir We're flying with Delta today, I've never flown flown with Delta I'm gonna give you a full comprehensive review as kc nice That would say not gonna get as many views as casey neistat but I will do the same I'm not gonna do the same thing okay, so while you are checking us in I'm gonna be over there Getting a coffee no because we have to go to through security before you can get a coffee so I can't get a coffee no Because if you don't drink it it before then you'll don't they'll make you throw it out I'm going to be extremely upset if our terminal doesn't have good coffee and or good snacks because my mom is a technology genius She managed to get our boarding passes on to our phones like a real savage so now all we have to do is show up Pop it as I was saying before I got rudley interrupted my mom got our boarding passes on our phones Insanity, I was really proud of her for doing that for me I had TSA PreCheck And my mom didn't which was upsetting because I said just stay here and wait for my mom to be done which was My life is so hard why? am I zoomed in like this gate 44 my mom doesn't believe me, but I know how to read a goddamn monitor, so No, can we find our gate first ma'am? honey we need to find the gate before you can go potty I think I see a coffee place don't jinx it. I don't wanna  jinx it I'm gonna go see if I can find coffee because that's important even though I already had one today, but I want another one It's so good I've literally never had good Airport coffee in my life, and this is actually really good either that or I just really need coffee, so like anything tastes good I don't know. We're about to board pretty pumped just watch the bathroom, and I overflowed the toilet I wish that was a joke. I literally overflowed the toilet. I literally clogged it and it overflowed Okay, I need to cut this off now because you guys are probably unsubscribing This is what my intestines look like on the inside We're literally in the last row which means we get no recline in our chairs like our chairs won't recline. Recline?why can I not say that word? I'll say that word, but it's only an hour flight, so it's like whatever. It's fine I am a little bit hashtag salt gang These seats are like really compact like I feel like very confined this definitely not first class. Okay. That's what I have to say not first class That was artsy that was so artsy It was a little bumpy not gonna lie I literally only got to use the Wi-Fi for like 30 minutes before they told me I had to put my laptop away So that's annoying it smells like play-doh It smells like play-doh. No it smells like chucky cheese. I smell chucky  cheese literally smells like chucky cheese It's a pleasure to welcome you to Los Angeles where the local time is 12:57 please remain seated with your seatbelts fastened and your carry-on Items stood until the aircraft has parked at the gate and the Captain has turned the seatbelt sign off, I peed in the plane it was absolutely insane It was gross actually Well because when I went in there the person in there before me didn't flush the toilet So I had to flush it for them I'm sorry, but I don't want to pee on top of the stranger's pee so I did their duty And I flushed it for them. You're welcome. Ma'am if you're watching   we are taking a taxi, I feel like I'm living in the 1900's when was the last time someone took a taxi taxis are dead Its uber time baby, but actually we are taking a taxi because it's easier Oh Wow, oh shit I get my own bed bitch. Oh my god. There's a menu. Oh my god They have coffee tall and handsome both tall dark and handsome oh wow You have a nice view of the street, let's see how the fuck do I open this oh? Fuck my life ooh we have this little deck very narrow extremely narrow And we have a nice view  just yelped and I found this place called butchers daughter, and it looks really yummy So I think we're gonna go there because we don't have a rental car or anything cuz we're only gonna be here for a few Days, we either have to take users or walk, so we're walking there. Oh my god. They have snacks. Holy shit They have snacks this I might shove down my throat dark chocolate peanut gems oh yeah, bitch. I'm eating that raw dark chocolate Holy shit. I'm gonna be eating this too before we go Okay, now I can go They have a quite generous coffee menu, so we'll definitely be getting some of that. I'll show you what I get once It comes really excited really hungry very hungry Extremely hungry. She's decaf, but she's still a beauty queen look at her look at this beautiful avocado toast I feel like a trendy food boo God eating this healthy Kelsey said that she's really Close to the butcher's daughter where I'm eating and so she might come say hi And I'm so excited because I've never met her in real life before so it's like meeting My first time meeting an internet friend in real life very excited very ecstatic. It is my literal Queen hi Oh my god I am so tired my phone died like a few hours ago And I haven't used my phone since it's been insane put on some sweats and life is good I would just like to report that I just pulled down my pants in front of this and there's people out there They could have seen my vagina don't demonetize me"

On the count of three, we're gonna name the most influential human being on this planet at the moment. There's one correct answer. One, two, three, lil pump! Oh ****! Okay, good. If you didn't say lil pump get off. Click off. He's universally just the most inspirational being of the time right now. Everyone's obsessed with lil pump. He's huge, and he's not the only one. There's lil xan, six nine or some shit. What are they? SoundCloud rappers. I decided you know what I'm done being a nobody. I'm done being somebody who isn't helping this world. I'm not doing shit, and so I thought it'd be kind of fun if I just turn myself into a Soundcloud rapper today. I don't really know what this is gonna do for me. I don't even know how to upload something to SoundCloud, but either way. Let's get started. The first thing we gotta do is we gotta come up with a name. no one has their regular name. You know what I'm saying. Everybody has like a special little stage name like lil pump, what's his real name? Hold on lil pump's real name is jazzy Gazi Garcia, okay? Well my real name is Emma Chamberlain, and that's gotta change from now on I'm going by the name lil moop. yeah ya heard that right. lil moop. Are you confused? Well shut up. coming up with a name for me was very easy. Okay, when I was younger I used to be called mooper that was one of my nicknames, so it seemed fitting. Please only refer to me as such from now until forever. Thank you. Okay next we're just jumping straight on into the outfit this, it's not gonna do. We need to change. Okay now that we have a little bit of a SoundCloud rapper outfit, I mean we got the Gucci, we got the Gucci, we got the Gucci, we got some camo pants. I don't even think soundcloud rappers wear these kinds of pants, but like this is all I got you know. But like I'm not feeling it yet. I don't feel like a SoundCloud rapper yet at all Do you know what it is? I think it's the hair. Let's let's fix the hair. SoundCloud rappers tend to have kind of like a little bit of a you know they tend to do their hair maybe a little bit more unique and so today, I'm going to be trying to come up with an exclusive look. It's not like you see 69 walking around with a nice manicured head. You know what I mean. I went to the store yesterday, and I was trying to find some temporary hair dye. Yeah, you heard that right, I was gonna temporarily dye my hair for this video. Sadly I couldn't find any that like washed out immediately and all of them took like two weeks to wash out and I don't want to look like an idiot for two weeks, so we improvised. I still don't feel like a SoundCloud rapper. I literally don't know what I'm missing Oh, face tats. Although I would get face tats for this video there's no appointments available today, so that idea was canceled. We have some cheap-ass eyeliner So let's see if it'll do the trick. It seems like SoundCloud rappers tend to tattoo important things on their face. Just things that they love, things that they like, things that have meaning to them. Holy shit, okay, ah Mami Moop, baby! Aight, we done. I already feel more rapper. Now that I got the tats I'm starting to feel it a little bit. Let's do a quick rundown first. We got mami moop across the eyes. You know representing me. Who I am Next we got right here some teardrops. I don't know what that means, but I always see people with it squad. Oh god. This is so cringe. Right here, We got a bagel around it it says bae goalz. ya bitch loves bagels. bagels are my bae goalz. Get what I'm fuckin saying? Good. Next, under my lips, we got hella chapped. A bitch loves chapstick. Ok, we got a nice Chanel bag under my eye. Symbolism. Do you know what? Sleep is for the fuckin weak. But these bags designer. You feel me? Next, we got the Gucci logo here. I want to be wearing Gucci even when I'm naked, so. Last but not least on my neck we have the most important. We got the latte gang up in here bitch. I don't think anyone nae-nae's ever. Oh yeah, baby, holy shit! Yeah, the transformation is complete. Or so you thought? You can't be a soundcloud rapper without a rap song. Well, I have news for you. I wrote a rap song. Do you believe me? no? funny. That's funny cuz listen to this. I would tell you to go download it on iTunes, but this song fucking sucks no one wants to download it on iTunes."

I have not applied any chapstick yet this morning, so you know what time it is Okay, so today. We have some fun activities planned You've been kind of caught up on my last few videos you would know that I'm not too happy with the restaurant sweet green Because they f*ucked up my salad and I never want to go there again okay blah blah I got a dm from sweet green offering me a free salad, so we're going to sweet green today Not right now though because it's 10:00 a.m.. And I do not want to go to sweet green at 10:00 a.m. Start out today's vlog. We're going to all right everybody let's take a wild guess one two three Philz! Did we all say it? I bet Also speaking of Philz yesterday, I was sitting at Philz editing just minding my own business drinking my coffee Do you feel me? And all of a sudden a woman walks up to me and hands me a little envelope And I was like what and then kind of scurries off, and I didn't see her again So I grabbed the envelope and I open up the envelope and it's a in Philz gift card a  freakin Philz gift card! for me! what in the literal did I do to deserve that? and then I turn around and she's gone and I can't even thank her I Felt so bad. I just wanted to go and give her a big hug! Hold on I have to play fast and furious for a second just so that I can get in the correct lane Okay Good, I don't, okay. I just don't like my outfit today. I'll walk you through what it is. I'll give you an OOTD. My growler's t-shirt which is their merch which you can get from their website. This is choker from over school Which is a local brand and the girl who owns it is freaking awesome I'll leave the Instagram and the website in the description go check them out go buy a few things Jeans are vintage or - in my shoes are the Puma like thick bottom. I think it's fenty Puma is it fenty Puma I don't know, then I'm also wearing a thrifted Levi's Sherpa lined jacket. That is way too big for me I don't really like today's outfit. I don't like it. I'm gonna be honest I don't because I don't like wearing t-shirts with like a cute outfit like I don't like that unless they're cropped. That's different I've done better and I've done worse so it's like what can you do, but anyway see you at Philz fam All right just finished at Philz and That was nice. I haven't applied chapstick in like 45 minutes insane Just planned a trip for later this week, so that's kind of a surprise. I'm gonna vlog it. It'll be great It's time to go eat some lunch because guess what I didn't even eat breakfast cuz I'm a savage like that No, just kidding. I don't like breakfast now I used still love breakfast, but now I get nauseous in the morning, so I'm getting really hungry So we're gonna go get that sweet greens. Let me in please. Please let me yas!! oh shit, did I even tell you guys I parked in a parking spot when I was at Philz that's free two hour parking But I accidentally parked there for four hours, and I didn't get a ticket So that's pretty fuckin swag. I look at the clock and I was like well My life you know I'm definitely gonna get a ticket I've literally been there for four hours, but then I go And they didn't give me a ticket so shout-out to the Popo for not catching me. I appreciate it Just feeling a little bit hashtag blessed about that But I really have to pee and I'm really hungry if sweet green can win back my heart I would be willing to give them my business from now until forever Today's salad has to be really looking good their game hasn't stepped up Significantly since the last time I was there it's over and I'm not afraid to school they I did it once and I'll do it again Okay, just finished my food. I'm gonna take my Whoa I'm very full the thing about eating Salads as like a full meal is that like you eat a big salad you get so full because it's so much volume But it's not that many calories in a salad as long as you don't get ranch. I am so popular. I'm like really channeling major 12 year old boy vibes today whenever I wear like t-shirts I look like a 12 year old boy for the rest of the day, and it pisses me off. I just accept myself I love myself it's fine I'm lying the salad was definitely better. It was not bad It was the same as it usually was I think that that one bad experience was kind of like a one-off thing and it probably Will never happen again the kale was fine. There was a few stumps in there, but nothing out of the ordinary I'm glad that I gave them another chance it was good, but I'm so incredibly full I literally think I'm to throw up because as I just said salads are so filling because there's so much volume But then you end up getting hungry really fast right after because there's not that many calories in there you digest it really quickly Well, not really quickly, but it like kind of like it condenses in your stomach, and then you get hungry again I think that's don't do not that is so probably not true I just made that up that is literally a fact that I just came up with but I'm assuming. That's what happens I mean like I took biology Like I'm just connecting the dots my hair is so soft cuz I washed it last night I try not to wash it too much because Supposedly, I read online that the more you wash your hair the quicker it gets oily and my hair gets oily really quick But I stopped washing my hair as much and then now it doesn't get as oily as quick Oh, I am a hygiene goddess my hygiene is absolutely out of this world completely spectacular. I smell so good all the time All the time I shower twice a day I shower it's you know a shower four times a day morning before breakfast after breakfast after lunch after dinner I shower like once a week. I watch some youtube just chilled out in my bed And now I'm gonna make some decaf coffee because I feel like it so suck my weenie I'm kind of hungry, but like I'm not quite hungry, but when I do get hungry I'm gonna have a bagel and it's got to be a lid as much time, but I'm not hungry yet But I like okay, you know what you feel a little bit, okay? You know when you feel like a little bit hungry like just a teensy bit, but you know that if you eat You'll get overly full instantly I've been having like a headache for the past like literal like week like I just have a headache constantly Which is not good lately? I've been cutting myself down to one caffeinated coffee per day. Just what? Because I used to have like four or five caffeinated coffees per day very bad, don't do that Anyway, I think I've been on a face mask. Let's go put on a face mask in my p.o Box one of you guys sent me this sensitive Rosewater mask looks like this by the brand I'm not gonna try to say that without it's that brand and it's actually really really good My skin's I'm looking better if you've never tried this I recommend trying it out It's like a really chill mask It just feels like lotion on your face kind of but it's really good, so I would recommend it Just kind of soaks into your skin And then like you just kind of wash off the part that didn't sink into your skin. Oh well Do you guys have been asking me about my skin and like what I did to kind of make it less bad It's still bad, but it's a much less bad, and I used cure ology. This is not sponsored I Don't you really think cure ology would sponsor me like that's a joke at first It wasn't really working and now it's like working and then sometimes I break out anyway stuffs not like that great I use Proactiv didn't work, so I'm trying to be better about it because I used to be really bad And I would just not do anything like I wouldn't wash my face I wouldn't like use moisturizer like I literally did nothing to my face And then I'm up to the age where it's just like you have to start doing something or else you're gonna break out so now That's what I use to Answer all your questions, okay, but now that my face mask goes on We got to put on some traps take this is Carmack's so you've always asked like oh, what kind of chopstick Do you use every kind separate us because I those are not good I used to be obsessed with the u.s.. Oh? geez but I stopped being obsessed with that because I Heard that they're like bad for your lips or something But I used car max this Nivea chapstick brand Alba or some shade I am. I'm chopped see coming out the ass I use so many different rap stick. I don't know okay. I just love traps Oh aquaphor is really good too damn Vaseline mini, Vaseline. Okay. I'm done. I'm really done talking about chapstick like everyone's I'm subscribed I bet It's bagel time bitch What there's mold on this yeah You just bought these come here no Well, you can just cut that off because that's not a bad kind of mo. Just cut that off Would you make some rest of it teeth anymore Holmes? Yeah, I would just if you don't just toss that one look see that shit right there That's some frickin mold okay, and I don't I don't know about you, but I don't like consuming mold Thank God. It was just on that one all the other ones are fine, but that was seriously upsetting. I mean seriously When I'm not drinking coffee. I'm most likely drinking look Kroy So basically I put ice in it, and then I put in the Lacroix That was unnecessary then I take two of these lime packets and put it in the Lacroix, and you might be like Emma Why don't you just eat the lime flavored Lacroix the answer is because it doesn't taste as good These lime packets have such a good lime flavor to actually taste like real lime whereas the lime Lacroix doesn't actually taste like real lime It tastes kind of funky in my opinion. That's my opinion don't hate so yeah Oh Now we take vegan butter you guys know the drill by now. This is nothing new also. This is my mom's ginger I don't know what she uses it for but Anyways, I'm so excited to get this in my bed right now I eat shit in my bed, which is just so bad, and then I like get crumbs in my bed And it's so annoying and gross, but I do it anyway. I am a horrible person, but I can't stop It's so nice eating in bed. I just get to like eat in bed, and I know okay. It's a bad habit Don't yell at me, okay?         moans     music        "

judge a book by it's cover did you really think I was gonna start this video off by putting on chapstick don't judge a book by it's cover just kidding I actually am putting on chapstick good morning guys how are you cheers Wow I'm doing just great I've had kind of an intense week and a half just a little bit intense but you don't care about that I don't know I've just been busy like I feel like I've been super busy and I haven't got any time for some me time you know what I mean I've been just not I haven't been in touch with my soul you know I've just been kind of working too hard on nothing but that's beside the point today I decided it would be a good idea a nice little idea if I went to the city San Francisco by myself for a little date with myself and you guys I kind of like to do that I feel like it's nice for me to just hang out in the city hang out wherever and just kind of spend the day to myself I want to go shopping I go shopping if I want to get food I get food if I want to get coffee I get coffee the thing that's great about it if you go on a date with yourself it's like whatever the you want to do if you're ready to go home you go home you want to stay for longer you stay for longer if you want to go do whatever it's up to you you know that awkward feeling when you're like out with a friend and like you deep down really want Japanese food but they really really deep down want Mexican food and you guys are both kind of fighting for that oh no it's true like I'll get whatever but like deep down you really want Japanese like you do you want it but you're not gonna say it out loud and like she really deep down wants Mexican food and you know the deep down she has a specific preference of what she wants and you have a deep down really specific preference of what you want and then you end up both like settling for something that you don't want I don't know like that's the kind of [ __ ] that stresses me out and that doesn't happen when you go alone because if you deep down want a panini's food you don't gotta sugarcoat it to nobody you go get Japanese for the view know what I'm saying so today for my little date with myself when I say myself I mean also you guys cuz you guys are a part of me oh here's what we're doing today as a fun activity as you know it's Christmas time [ __ ] in San Francisco during Christmas time Union Square which is like if you don't know about Union Square it's basically there's like malls a bunch of high-end stores regular stores there's like this big square it has like statues and like a huge Christmas tree and like ice skating and [ __ ] it's just basically a tourist mayhem it's like tourists tourists whatever they freaking love Union Square like holy [ __ ] because I live in San Francisco or I don't live in San Francisco I live like near San Francisco whenever I go there I avoid Union Square because it's super busy it's a bunch of like kind of built-up stuff and it's not as charming in my opinion as like the other areas of San Francisco my point is I don't usually go there because I'm kind of against it a little bit I'm kind of like a snob about it I'm like now like I don't want to go there now I don't care about the Christmas tree I don't want to go because of this kind of like judgment in my heart that I have regarding Union Square for the past few years I've just having gone because I'm so judgmental of it and I'm always automatically like now not going up everybody's like you want to go to Union Square now very against it but today I thought it would be fun if I kind of spent the day in Union Square so I'm pretty excited about it I think it's gonna be a great days person it's really being a [ __ ] so please don't be a [ __ ] like that okay well we're in it now so cut her off maybe even do a little bit of shopping I really don't need clothes I do not need clothes at all just arrived I found a parking garage that's pretty close by and I found a parking spot which is unbelievable I have a little bit of my coffee left so I thought I'm just gonna drink the rest of this coffee and I'll talk to you for a little bit while I finish it the thing that I want to talk about is the other day I watched a really great movie on Netflix and I wanted to recommend it to you guys the movies called zodiac this is not sponsor a movie it's based in San Francisco / Bay Area area it's like based on a true story like this [ __ ] actually happened so that's kind of wild state up until like 3:00 a.m. watching it like two nights ago and then woke up the next morning feeling genuinely like ill because I was so tired but it was so worth it like I could not stop watching like I wanted to like turn it off and I'll finish it tomorrow I couldn't and I also have somebody who doesn't really like movies like I know crazy but I don't really like movies that much my bringing moves too fast I can't sit through a movie sorry I don't know it's not too violent like even though it does include murder it's more about the mystery and it's more like intense it's not like scary like after I finished watching the movie I had to get up and go pee and I wasn't scared to go pee which is like says something for me because I'll literally watch like a Shane Dawson conspiracy theory video and I'll have trouble like walking through the bathroom alone like but for some reason this movie didn't spook me out so yeah I definitely recommend it I thought I would throw that in here let you know it's a good movie let's go sir date first we are going to the mall because do you know what I think that that's a great place to start then we're gonna go we'll go to the actual Union Square this mall is huge I don't know where anything is to find PacSun still lost still have not found any stores that I know well know I know them all but like I'm not gonna go into the tory burches store because I'm not rich yeah thank you though I see Lululemon I'll go in I like Lululemon I'll go in there you know I went on Lululemon wasn't no because I'm not in the mood to spend 100 bucks on leggings but not in a really big shopping mood so I think I'm gonna leave soon but oh there's vans I just bought two pairs of vans that's bad I'm literally addicted to vans I love them but I'm done with the small I'm gonna go walk to Urban Outfitters because there's an Urban Outfitters kind of near here I'm gonna walk to the urban and then also near that there's a new brandy Melville it's two stories tall so that's cool people are laughing at me because I'm vlogging but do you know what that's okay because they're missing out I'm home I'm literally home [Music] nothing in urban is exciting me so I think I'm gonna go to Brandi now a retail therapy is my hobby okay we're leaving them before I get out of hand [Music] okay brandy melville is complete I bought two belts I don't know why I just felt like it I guess I'll show you them later I'll do a in-depth haul but now that I'm done with my shopping I think I'm done with the shopping for the day I'm just not a shopping mood let's go to Union Square like the actual square itself and see the tree and [ __ ] because that's fun right [Music] perfect you raise a ball minimal and I have an iced latte with almond milk here's a cafe here's the tree I'm going to try out the coffee see if it's any good no it's all about the experience you know because you have the coffee and then you have the tree it's all about the experience you know spirit so unless you know [Music] I'm too poor for this just finished I'm done I just I'm not committed for shopping but let me do a quick home I saw so many stores and I was like who I'd love to go in there but then I was like okay I just don't want to go so first I got this bout from Brandi then I got this belt it's like really nautical I don't really know how I'm gonna style this yet I got two pairs of bands I'm a mess the cool vans that I got are these burnt orange like leisa I think these are freaking wet and I'm really excited about them I kind of wanted to get some like fun vans because every time I tried to get like fun crazy ones I always end up returning them because I'm like I won't wear these but I feel like these are actually where we'll see it might end up returning these two we'll see and then the second thing I got you guys are all gonna die I finally got a new pair of white vans white vans are my staple shoe I always wear white vans my white vans currently look a little something like this [Music] they're absolutely disgusting and I don't like buying new white vans because I don't like when my shoes are super white I kind of look like when they look a little bit worn in so I've kind of been hesitant to buy new ones but I finally decided that I would do it whatever now I'm gonna go get food at this coffee place called revelry they have really good almond butter and jelly and they have really good salad so I'm gonna go there and then they also have really good coffee all right but first we got to get out of this [ __ ] parking garage which is so stressful [ __ ] okay I'm stressed out let's exit this [ __ ] yes okay we're out oh thank god that's over I hate leaving parking garages I always feel like I'm gonna get locked in somehow and like it won't let me out or something I don't know I very unrealistic fears anyway so review of Union Square the coffee I got was asked it was so bad it was discussing so I'm gonna need to redeem myself there's a lot of cute things around here but it's not like cute boutique II [ __ ] like everything is kind of like a chain if you wanted to get food you'd have to get like Chipotle or like McDonald's so we're like Budin there's something which is a chain around here I don't know if they have that everywhere I was like do you want I don't even want to eat around here I just want to kind of go into a little cuter area maybe a little bit oh [ __ ] oh my god these people are on drugs way oh no I can't go there's pedestrians you can [ __ ] [ __ ] there's literally pedestrians like I'm not stupid also there's so many people on drugs around my car right now and I'm having severe anxiety oh my god this is the most confusing [ __ ] intersection I have ever been in this makes no [ __ ] sense holy [ __ ] wow wow I might die I have to drive through the financial district to get to where I'm going and the financial district is like basically where all the like big business buildings are and stuff if there's a lot of working people here and everybody it's 1:30 so everyone's going on their lunch break right now so there's pedestrians in everywhere holy [ __ ] youtuber goals get stressed out all the time while driving goals has panic attacks on camera goal saw goals if you've ever had to parallel park on a hill like parallel parking is already hard but parallel parking on a slant is [ __ ] hard especially when it's going downhill I don't know I've never done anything like it and it was [ __ ] hard I'm really glad that it's over look how pretty like this view is like we have like this street and like the financial weight what's a code transmitter building and a [ __ ] remember let's go get some food I'm hungry I don't know about you fam my tummy's a grumbling so there's a lot of strip clubs around here I'm in North Beach right now North Beach has a [ __ ] ton of strip club so maybe I'll go in you know put on a little show and then dip but we'll see oh okay just that one okay I just had to walk up a hill to get to my car so that was kind of difficult oh man thanks for the day okay so just hung out in there for a little bit um why am I so out of breath from walking up a literal hill like it was not even that steep why am I so tired I'm so I think I need to grind harder in the gym I got a kale salad that was not vegan so sorry everyone who is gonna hate on me for that I'm vegetarian I try to be vegan as much as possible but you know what cheese ends up on [ __ ] sometimes it's a good salad it was like a kale kale salad it was really good it had like avocado pumpkin seeds Parmesan cheese and then some dressing I don't even know how to describe dressing this I got there almond butter and jelly toast which was super good I really enjoyed it listen to this [ __ ] so sitting in revelry which was the cafe understand scrolling through Twitter I love Twitter you'll never guess who can DM me are you ready sweet green now listen to this if you watched my last vlog not my last video but my last vlog which was called I was betrayed or something like that I'll link it down below I basically ranted about sweet green which is a restaurant if you don't know for like literally two minutes talking about how mad I was at them because their salad was messed up if you want to know why I was mad at sweet green watch the video I don't want to explain it again they deemed me because I was pretty pissed about it in the video I think you could tell and I posted that video yesterday okay already I get a DM from sweet green that says hello Emma Wow hello and I heard that you had a bad experience at one of our locations which location was it and then I said hi it was that so location okay don't kidnap me what was the issue if I may ask and I said the kale was mainly stem rather than kale greens and the kale greens that were in it were wilted because that's true it was pretty traumatic oh I think they're about to give me a free salad hold on they just now responded we're so sorry about the unpleasant experience thank you so much for letting us know we'll okay blah blah blah the meantime we would love to make this up to you do you use our app if so I can add some credit directly to your account just send me the email address associated to the count do you know I actually respect that because you know after that video if you watched my video and you saw the rant about sweet green I was pretty upset with them like I really didn't even have any interest in ever going there again but if they're gonna give me free credit like I will go back but I appreciate the gesture you know that they would listen to my cry for help and then give me free salad or something that's nice right thank you sweet green if you're watching this sorry for going off on you but I was just being honest anyway I think on today's vlog I'm just gonna go home Raleigh lay in bed watch some videos and then go to the gym at night but I don't feel in the gym because I'm not a hashtag tool so I hope you enjoyed today's vlog if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want I had fun on our little date today I love doing little dates by myself and I would definitely recommend that you do it too because I like it because I think it's a good thing I think it's a healthy thing to be independent and go out and like just have fun on your own and kind of like spend some quality time with you going out and doing [ __ ] on your own makes you feel good because you're like I don't need nobody I'm an independent ass woman you feel me and it makes you feel badass I know like it with me like I'll be more likely to be like I don't know like if somebody's sitting next to me in a cafe and like they're like drinking an iced almond milk latte - I'll be like these are pretty good right yeah I'll be more likely to like talk to other people whereas like if I'm with somebody else I'm not gonna talk to anybody else you know what I mean some are tea with someone but when you do stuff alone you're more likely to be social and kind of step outside of your box in your social comfort zone and I really think that that's healthy and good so I know I have the most fun when I'm alone I love you all appreciate you all and I'll see you next time [Music]

- much love, emma chamberlain",2017-12-10T23:31:20Z,48566,1425441,1972,"Yes, I wore this sweater in a video before sue me Your favorite DIY queen is back, and she's ready for Action hey guys it's Emma the DIY Queen and today I'm back with another video you might not know me as a DIY Queen But I mean I kind of am you know the holidays are coming up And you know what that means your wallets are gonna be emptied out from all the gift buying a pair of ugg boots for your Younger sister a KitchenAid mixer for your mom all that shit It adds up and next thing you know you're broke as fuck But you know what the new trend is the new wave of gifts dIY homemade Gifts the epitome of like it's the thought that counts when somebody makes you a DIY gift You probably aren't gonna like it and you're probably gonna throw it away most of the time DIY gifts are absolute shit so today. I went on Pinterest and I tried to find some DIY Homemade gift ideas that would actually be useful stuff that people actually Would like and I found nothing I didn't find any good ideas instead of giving up I was like you know what maybe these gift ideas are actually good so I decided today I'm gonna make a few of them I went on Pinterest and I searched DIY Christmas gifts for teens if you're a mom and you're watching this probably don't make these for your kids unless you want them to light your kitchen on Fire put shit in the laundry basket. I don't know dashing through the snow So the first, item we have is so cool speakers are freakin expensive I mean like I'm talking like 80 bucks 100 bucks 200 bucks 300 bucks 400 bucks 5 foot sorry I found a way you can make a DIY speaker And I am so excited about it things that you're gonna need toilet paper roll some decorative tape some tacks The first step is to take out I went through a washi tape phase when I was like in like 5th grade so I have a shit ton of it But the thing about washi tape is it doesn't even fucking stick to shit, okay This is the decorated thing I didn't want to decorate the rest because I got bored But I have the iPhone 7 plus, and it is really large, so I don't know if it's even gonna fit in here Let's try it out, okay Oh shit, I ripped it open. Okay. Let's tape it Pretty loud not gonna lie, but now let's shove it into the speaker and see okay I must say although it is kind of stupid. It does prop up the phone pretty nicely It's not like that much louder, but this shit actually works don't make this don't make this actually honestly It's kind of good make this for yourself, but don't make this for somebody else unless you want to lose all your friends Okay moving on No one uses this do you know what maybe I'm wrong, maybe people do use body scrub I've personally never used body scrub what you need for this DIY is? Sugar candy canes it says that you're supposed to have peppermint essential oil, but I can just find peppermint extract, so hopefully that works coconut oil and a mini little mason jar Okay the recipe says that what you're supposed to do is lend them up in a food processor But do you really think that I'm gonna go get my food processor out blend up this shit instead I'm just gonna be pounding it myself by just putting it into a bag and then slamming things against the table so that everything breaks bone  apple tit Shit it's leaking Oh God okay, now, I can understand where you're supposed to use a food processor because like this is not working but Whoa Okay, you know what, fuck it. I'm just gonna wing it. I'm not measuring shit today not today. Not ever. I don't know I'm sorry Yes, I'm mixing this with my finger because I'm trashy. You know i'm fixing in the both fingers. I'm gonna need this shit Did I wash my hands before this no last step is that we take some of this peppermint extract? I'm making a huge mess Hugh it doesn't smell like peppermint at all that smells like alcohol Probably because peppermint extract is made with alcohol the number one. Yeah, okay well I don't care to make this a very DIY Trendy recipe of course we have to put it inside of a mason jar and it's getting all over my table Okay, we pack it in cute cute, but on the top cute now Let's go over to the bathroom and see if it works. kinda looks good. Let's try it out rub It around on our hands. It kind of feels good Okay It kind of hurts. I'm expecting some fucking baby soft ass hands if my hands Don't feel like a baby's thigh after this. I'm gonna be pissed My hands definitely feel soft, but they also feel really oily And that is so not okay with me at all And so I'm gonna have to give this recipe a thumbs down because that pisses me off. I'm gonna leave it right here Just in case any one of my family wants to use it even though I feel like everybody will use it and then be like why did you do that to me and now my hands are oily? and I can't do anything because if I touch anything, but everything I touch will get oily and Actually it's not that bad. Why my hands are actually really fucking this off. Holy fuck My hands are really soft. Oh my god And they look good too. Okay. Well. Do you know maybe this isn't so bad. I don't know eww my tables all oily now fuck the next DIY I'm actually a little bit excited about because I feel like this could actually turn out kind of cool I don't know I think the mugs are like one of the more useful kinds of gifts because like you can use it And if they look cute like even if they don't look cute You can still use them all you have to do is just drop nail polish into a cup of water and like make designs with It well fuck it I'm pouring like a bunch of the bottle in and then all you do is you just dip a mug inside and then it makes cool designs on the mug I personally think that that's dope we're gonna be taking this mug and we're just gonna be diving right into it I'm a little bit nervous, but oh shit. It's getting inside. Oh That's so cool it actually turned out really cool. Oh look at that design Look at I'm living for this shit. What the fuck. Oh, my what bitch that's pretty cool I'm not gonna lie this do I might have to be a winner from me it turned out super well I don't know. I'm just excited about this so fuck off, just let me be excited okay This is just my moment to be a DIY queen and don't ruin it for me. Oh my god I'm having way too much fun with this daaaaamn look you fucking cute boo moral of the story, this is a good DIY I make it at home and have fun. Be yourself. Love yourself. Be yourself be yourself. Love yourself Okay, we're down to our last two DIYs after the one that we just did I don't think that we could ever do any better I thought that it was gonna. Go really bad, and then it was gonna be funny because it's me. Oh my god emma's so bad at DIY Know I'm actually the DIY Queen and it really shows with that mug the future is promising when I saw this on Pinterest I knew I needed to recreate it first you're gonna need a clear glass ornament And you're just gonna want to take the top off. There's two types of families There's one that decorates their tree with all these Expensive ornaments from like William Sonoma and like Martha Stewart's line at Target and all that shit And then there's other kind of family that decorates their trees with like ornaments that their family made over the years and like their Kindergarten class and shit oh, I'm not even explaining what I'm doing though. You're gonna Take some yellow paint, and you're just gonna want to shove a bunch of it inside I chose some non-toxic paint so that if I get hungry I can eat some Shit in my opinion getting somebody in ornament is the worst gift you could ever get somebody I know it's the thought that counts okay I know, but here's the thing about an ornament if you get someone an ornament They can't even use it until next year because most likely you're opening it on Christmas And when do you enjoy ornaments the time leading up to Christmas? Judy Odom say maybe this could be something that you could make for a Secret Santa Oh shit, Secret Santa usually you open the gifts way before Christmas I remember Secret Santa when I was in Middle School was just so Stressful here's something about Secret Santa all right everyone knows who got everyone No one actually keeps it a secret So it's kind of like pointless because by the second day Everybody already knows who everyone else has and everyone's just acting like they don't know and like every once in a while You'll Maybe be surprised but it's a very rare occasion that you'll actually be surprised because you already you already know you're gonna go and you're gonna tell your Best friend like in the group because usually do it in a group and you're gonna go to your one best friend And you're gonna be like oh like guess who I got and then they're gonna be like who did you get they would tell you? Who they got and the next thing you know it's just no longer fun anymore because you connect the dots and you're like well Susie Has Lexie and if Lexie has I can't think of any more names, and it's Lexie has Sandra Then it must be the Sandra has me and you know what, I don't even like Sandra Sandra gets shitty gifts bet you 20 bucks She's gonna give you a gift card to Claire's have fun Okay, I have minion all over my hands BRB You're just going put the top back on and now you basically just have a yellow ornament. Oh My god I could have just bought a yellow ornament next you're gonna get out your hot glue. Oh, I'm gonna burn myself I will burn myself I remember I used to love hot glue like I was Obsessed with hot glue and I like begged my mom to like buy me a hot glue gun Because I was like no mom I swear like I need it cuz I do so much crafts. I'm so good at crafts I've been a DIY queen since I was younger so basically I begged my mom to give me a hot glue gun She finally got me one and ever since then I've been burning my fingers left and right. I genuinely truly wish that Christmas Existed but without gifts It makes you hate your family. Let's say you ask for a Gucci belt, and you'll wake up in that goddamn Gucci belt isn't under the tree you're gonna hate mom for the rest of the year You're gonna be like mom why didn't you get me the Gucci belt? It's only $400 mom and then your mom's gonna say well Do you know what kid I have to pay for you to go to college? So the Gucci belt wasn't my main priority Do you know why it's Sandra's probably gonna be a bitch to her mom for the rest of the year glue on a googly Eye, awesome you don't get I'm putting on two just for good measure, okay It's starting to look like a minion, but not quite yet. It just kind of looks stupid. Yeah, It just looks stupid Maybe it's because why does it look so bad? have I told you that I haven't even seen the minion movie like I talk shit about minions left and right like I hate on Minions, I've never even seen the movie, okay last But not least we outline the eyes with some silver because it says that you're supposed to use a silver pipe cleaner But do you really think I'm gonna go buy pipe cleaners. Yeah, that's a fucking joke Wow, that looks so bad to finish it off. I'm just gonna. Do you know what, fuck it I'm not finishing anything off This is the finished minion ornament I'm too lazy to give a string, so we're just gonna look at it like this should you make this? No, you shouldn't it looks like shit It's really stupid and you could just buy a minion ornament And you'd probably pay the exact same amount of money that I did on the materials for this. Here's the trash I'm throwing it in the trash bye, bitch So our last and not least DIY gift ornament this is also an ornament This is the best one. I actually came up with this on my own. I know crazy right emma being creative Unheard of all you need is a shot of espresso Which I have in this mini little mug here that has a cat on it cat lovers Subscribe I have some almond milk creamer, and then I have a glass ornament and a funnel This is gonna be a little mini ice almond milk latte in an ornament pour some espresso in there What do you know what this didn't work? We have to retry the creamer is too thick I'm gonna Go wash this out, and we're gonna try that all again and act like that never happened I'm just gonna pour this in here and drink it later I'm so gross round two let's try this shit again. Same process same idea except with almond milk this time Let's hope for the best because I'm not trying to do this again, and this idea is genius, so I don't wanna fuck it up Okay last but not least put on the ornament top and you got a nice almond milk latte in an ornament, baby This is great I was hoping for it to have more of the swirls in it like you know that I saw in mocha latte swirls as you Know what I'm talking about, but it doesn't have that but instead it does have this nice foam on the top. You know There's no ice cubes in here because we couldn't fit that but I think it's pretty cute. I think it's pretty diy although it's great although It's cute. It's also going in the trash I'm just gonna end this video here because I think you guys have I Think you guys have had enough of me the DIY Queen today. I hope you had fun If you did give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want I love you all appreciate you all and I'll see you in the next one"

How are you? Happy Monday. Well it's not Monday when you're watching this, it is Thursday but *coughs* it's Monday for me so suck it. Starting out the vlog today by going to Philz Coffee to edit, is anyone surprised? no, is anyone shocked? no, i'm excited... because I love Philz. I just f*cking love it there Because I go there literally 5 times a week minimum and I feel at home there, the staff knows me they don't have my order actually they- fuck it yah they do. They know my order, or at least some of them do. Which is kinda funny. Oh shit there's a bus. If I get hit by this bus it boutta be lit OOOU! WE SAVAGE--WE SAVAGE OUT HERE BOI!!!! So let's talk about some stuff while I'm driving to Philz. Number 1: I've been getting a lot of comments about Vlogmas. Why I'm not doing it? Am I doing it?? So, I deeply, deeply, considered doing Vlogmas. But, here's the thing about Vlogmas, ok? Daily vlogging, is NOT healthy. You can literally ask anybody who's ever daily vlogged for a length of time. You start to feel like everything you're doing is just for the camera. And I, used to make daily videos. When I first started my channel, for the first like, month. I made videos every single day. I posted every single day. I would wake up in the morning, I'd film for a little bit, and then I'd spend the rest of the day editing I enjoy when other people do Vlogmas. I just didn't wanna agree to it, and then not be able to do it to the best of my ability. That's my opinion on Vlogmas. let me just give you a lil quick OOTD so my top is thrifted, necklaces, top one is *man's voice* oh ho ho ho no no no oh ho ho oh *moaning followed by screech* is from stargaze, the bottom one is from forever 21 jeans are from the brand UNIF, they have great jeans,  shoes are blue vans also ive been getting a lot of questions about where my phone case is from my phone case is from wildflower cases, I'll li-liink them down *stutters* I'll link them down below, they have the best cases in the game and I stand by that belief and they have a nice bumper on them so if you drop your phone, it probably won't crack, maybe it will, i dunno also if you wanna know a little layout of what else we're gonna be doing today you know me and you on our little date today I'm going to be going to the mall becausssssee I want to get some new shoes Like, I wanna get some funky shoes I don't really know exactly what I want I'm thinking I might get Doc Martens Cause I wanted Doc Martens for a while now I might get Maybe like a new pair of high top Converse I don't really know Also gonna pick up some Christmas presents for a few peeps... Ew. Go ahead *distorted voice* I'm actually so weak right now This bitch OKAY *voice returns to normal* She's like crossing the street When like She has like the- hand that says don't walk I wasn't even close to her But like, I was gonna go Because I had the green light And she had the like, red hand that said don't go She decided to walk on that anyways and then she gets mad at me When I, like have to like stop at the middle of the intersection to like to make sure that this bitch can go it's like OKAY I understand that pedestrians have the right o way but like we have to, we're one big team here it's fine FOUND A SPOT BITCH okay, lets go get some work done! lets go grind it out in Philz! LETS GO GRIND YAASSSS *burps* mkay Okay so, I finished at Philz, now we can go have fun What the f-  ah *sneezes* As I said earlier, we're going to the mall right now Okay, I used to be a really big UGG boot girl Like I loved UGG boots And like, every single Christmas I would get new UGG boots Like that was my thing I'm no longer an UGG girl anymore for many reasons I don't really like how they look and also, ethically they're not the best So I don't buy from UGG anymore BUT I still need a like, fun, winter shoe I did want these converse They're like 120 bucks and so like... f*ck that, ummm.. Normal converse are like 60 bucks So I'm just gonna stick to that If I wanted that I could just paint on the red heart onto the side I could go on all day 'bout that sh*t But I did want them So like don't get me wrong, they are super f*cking cute Also, I'm really hungry Oh my god, I'm so hungry I dunno what I should eat Maybe I'll make some pasta Maybe a smoothie I kinda want pasta NO Because then I have to do my dishes You have to wash The whole pan POT Sorry, pot You have to wash, the bowl The fork I don't even mind doing dishes, like, it's totally fine with me But I just don't like washing pots and pans And I think that's how most people are But like, when I wash pots and pans I splash water all over myself Once I finish washing a pot or a pan My entire front side is just soaking wet It's kind of a similar thing to when you step into water when you're wearing socks You know how that feels It's not f*cking fun It's no different when you're doing the dishes and then you get water all over your shirt That might even actually be worse than stepping in water while wearing socks When you step in water while wearing socks it usually dries pretty quickly If you get a sh*t ton of water all over your shirt while you're doing the dishes you HAVE to change it does not dry it takes HOURS That's why I don't like making pasta Because there's a guarantee, 100 percent guarantee That my front of my shirt will get wet from washing the pot and like, I don't like that and I don't wanna take that risk So, I dunno maybe I won't make that, maybe I'll make a bagel but you know what, I shouldn't make a bagel because I'm running out of bagels I literally have one bagel left I make that bagel today and I'm not gonna have a bagel for the rest of the week unless I wanna go to the grocery store and get bagels specifically so should I eat my last bagel today? I dunno I dunno if I should because there is one left Yeah, I don't think I should eat a bagel I don't think I should because yeah, I can't What if, later in the week I'm craving a bagel more than anything and I can't even eat one because I ate my last one today I will hate myself should I go get food from somewhere? I like this restaurant well it's not really a restaurant it's kind of a restaurant called Sweetgreen They basically do, like customized salads I LOVE Sweetgreen okay? I used to go there, at least twice a week probably and get a salad because their salads are really good about two weeks ago I went to Sweetgreen and I had an experience that made me hate it and I haven't gotten it since you are allowed to choose like, any kind of green that you want lettuce, like, whatever So I chose kale then I get all of my toppings, whatever and then she mixes up the salad and it all looks good, whatever It looks pretty normal I wasn't really paying attention to anything, like I wasn't even looking at what her hands were doing I was like do you know what I'm putting my trust in your hands To make a long f*cking story short I put a whole bag of jelly beans- sorry. uh- to make a long fucking story short I put a whole bag o jelly beans up my ass To make a long f*cking story short I get my salad, I sit it in front of me and i start eating it and i come to realize that my salad rather than being kale greens it was like a bunch of kale stumps emma be a fucking smart bitch plan for THE FUTURE >:( AND DONT EAT THE GODDAMN BAGEL BECAUSE YOUR GOING TO REGRET IT LATER AND DO U KNOW WHAT, I KNOW THAT OKAY I'M NOT EATING THE BAGEL I'M NOT GOING TO EAT IT, IDK WHAT IM GONNA EAT BUT IM NOT GONNA EAT THE BAGEL, AND THATS WHAT WEVE COME TO CONCLUSions i think imma make pasta, fuck it im just gonna make pasta because do you know what.... yeah im gonna make pasta because, i don't even care like I'll WASH the pan myself, i'll wash the pots myself then it'll probably take 2 minutes out of my day what will i get out of it? a nice bowl of pasta my pasta is made out of garbanzo beans yeah, ya heard that right, ya heard that straight >:( it looks normal? IT TASTES NORMAL :O ya wanna check that out, this is the brand, not spons i know i've talked about the sponser before, and i probobly know that your sick of hearing about it but i really fucking like it and guess what im gonna go home and make some of it the dog martins and.... Dog martins but like there 140 bucks and like I don't how much i would even wear them? I feel like I would be wearing vans everyday anyways so that got shut down. Also it wasn't very comfortable which was really upsetting I though they were going to be super cumfy and they just simply were not and they were fuckin huge and heavy Then I just look around to get christmas gifts for anyone else and like nothing that I had in mind was in the store. and I'm  not going to go in details because.. those are secret things *turns* now but hey you know at least I tried I think i'm also like super hungry which is making me impatient also! here is a little ~Holiday Hack~ during the holidays go into go into william sonoma the store if you have one near were you live They always have some nice warm apple cider you could just go in there get some apple cider and then OW omg i just scratch myself in the ear shopping little cup with nice warm tasty apple cider and its kinda nice i don't really like apple cider but its the thought that counts *moan* did you hurt your self? A little bit:))))) *pours water lets pick out what type of past we want lets take a little look at what a rotini looks like for all your uncultured swines at home heres a rotini is penah might have to do the penay we have shells TEMPTING HMMM *sigh* Thing im gonna do the panay do we have an open pizza sauce?;000 YA pizza sauce...

- much love, emma chamberlain",2017-12-06T00:29:23Z,134377,4276077,6547,"Welcome to cooking with Emma! Hi. Hello Everyone. Wait- f*ck- ughh! What's up guys, it's Emma! Today I'm back wearing a turtleneck because I love turtlenecks. In today's video, we are doing yet another cooking with Emma. I love these... *reevaluating* Today I'm going to be making coffee cake because as you know it is now December and it's time to kind of make some holiday Recipes and I don't know about you, but for some reason coffee cake reminds me of Christmas time I think it's because my grandma used to make it she still does make it sometimes, and it's really f***in good So it's not really like an iconic Christmas recipe But I feel like it would be fun anyways so f**k off let's just get started. This recipe is vegan *looks in the camera* *reevaluates life* Let's get started Coffee cake has a lot of different layers as you know they have the cake part And then there's the crumbly part And then there's the topping this is gonna be one of the most complex cooking with Emma's that I've ever done And I am ready- are you? Don't care because I am! F*** you just kidding I'm sorry! so the first thing that we're making is the cinnamon sugar mixture look at this little thing right here Then I can scoop out the cinnamon sugar it's gonna be f*cking awesome in a small bowl combine coconut sugar and cinnamon alright F*** yeah You know what that used to startle me when I used to do that But now it doesn't anymore because I've done it so many times... oh sh*t we're already making a mess Do you want let's spice this sh*t up. Let's do the cinnamon challenge while we're at it I've never done the cinnamon challenge before and the fact that I have the cinnamon out here It would just be stupid if I didn't just kind of throw it in there because without me doing something like the cinnamon challenge this video will get no views *Dramatic music* *dying* Not that big of a deal... Oh sh*t Oh f*ck. Oh sh**. That's so f*cking gross. Oh my god. Ew! I didn't spit any of it out. It's all in my teeth! Alright, that was just a stupid waste of time. Line a nine by nine square pan This pan is 9 by 7 and this calls for 9 by 9 But you know what this one's just gonna have to do. Dang it! We improvise. Parchment paper... Do I even have that? YEAAAAAAAAAAAAH! This is... papier parchemin. What the f*ck? Is this not in English? This isn't even in English! Wait. Let me call my mom. Ok I'm pretty sure that's in French. She's not answering me... or maybe it's in Spanish. I'm very uncultured. That's just not working at all... putting this somewhere else... f**k Oh! Ok. Next we add coconut flour. Now, I don't like coconut flour I think it tastes f***ing rank. This recipe calls for baking s-sod- AH! soda and baking powder, which as I've discussed in other videos I think it's f*ckin annoying. Why can't we just do one or the other? I still don't understand the difference between the two even though on my last cooking with Emma You guys did comment down below the difference and I... *sighs* read it, but it didn't really make any sense to me so... *boom* Oh shoot! I spilled some *sniffs* Just kidding. That's a fucking joke don't do drugs kids. Salt. Okay. Where is it? Salt *illuminati confirmed plays* Say no more ahhhhhhhhh it's wow *proud noise* That was good. I'm absolutely so impressed with myself, what even was that like Hamilton is quaking, wait is Hamilton is that even a musical. I don't know *almost breaks a bowl* *laughs of satisfaction* Oh, also fun fact about this recipe so it calls for eggs, but as I do in most of my recipes you can actually substitute Applesauce for eggs, so I'm gonna be doing that today *burps* because this recipe is vegan take some coconut oil pow *ding ding* If I break that my mama's gumbo pIsSeD I have to warm up the coconut oil so it gets liquidy while it's warming up. What do you guys want to talk about? *sound of microwave in the background* *scratching* *smacks lips* *smacks lips again* ""beep* Oh Times up guess we can't talk about anything about 1/2. Cup. Holy f**k guys I just kind of guesstimated like how much I put in here. It's exactly 1/2 cup, okay? I'm not trying to tell you anything. I'm not trying to like make Rachael Ray quake. I'm not trying to make Gordon quake I'm gonna trying to make Guy Fieri roll around in his grave. Okay. He's not dead yet Yet, there's no way that that amount of meat is good for your arteries, but also do you see this right here? This is my an espresso umm not spons if you were wondering I got that on Black Friday, and it's been amazeballs it's been so amazing. I've been using it multiple times per day I have decaf pods that I rarely use because I'm addicted to caffeine and I also have no regular Caffeinated pods that like to you know make me feel like I'm on drugs is it overpriced of course It is but that's why I bought it on Black Friday even though in reality I bet that they like jack up the price so that they can make the sale better like so that the sale looks like a more substantial amount So I probably just got tricked by their marketing team my mom's calling me backum I was calling because why is the parchment paper in French Yeah, like the print or like Spanish or something it says poppy err party man That's why I called you originally because I wasn't sure if he was even parchment paper But then I did my research And I found that it was why is it in French like did you go to a French grocery store or something? We're not even French. We're not French That was a pointless phone call fuck How? Literally, I thought that only babies eat applesauce and this is way too fucking hard to open I would be very surprised if a baby could open this. I'm too without our handy-dandy top opener right for the shit Pop bitch I'm just hoping that like this recipe will like work with the applesauce because sometimes I get nervous that like it doesn't work in Every recipe it says online applesauce can replace egg in any recipe But like I'm not for sure you like my new pop socket  pretty fucking awesome Right whenever I put in the vanilla. I spill it today. I'm gonna try not to spill it woah Cashew we're almond milk. We're gonna be using almond milk because I don't own cashew milk because it's against my morals I don't feel like I'm challenged by cooking with Emma anymore. I feel like all these recipes I'm just too good at cooking now, but I need to start choosing recipes challenge me Maybe like filet mignon or something or maybe I did make a vegan filet mignon time to get the big whisk it is a sad time when I have to get the big whisk because I prefer working with the mini whisk  all of you guys are huge fans of The mini whisk you can't always do the mini stuff sometimes you have to do the big stuff, but size doesn't matter It's all stuck Okay stuck in there like it's in a little chamber get out bitch Open Sesame open that was disturbing why is I getting all stuck in the whisk Sorry I don't normally have anger issues That was not funny. I didn't wash my hands before I started. I'm sorry. Yeah. I know it's gross I'm the only one who's eating this so I didn't want to wash them. Okay. I'm sorry mom I know you're watching this and I know you're mad Wow there's a cat hair Oh God sanitation is few and far between with cooking with that much see if that was already Oh, no, there's baking powder cocaine on it. This is how we're creating the nice layers We have cake crumble cake crumble and that is what makes the signature coffee cake layers I pay attention to those details yummy in my tummy. I hope that this tastes good. The last cookie with that I did was my Funfetti one where I basically made a funfetti cake as you know sadly the cake tasted like f*cking sh*t So I'm hoping that we redeem ourselves with this one this parchment paper is a mess doesn't that look kinda cute 35 minutes on the clock you know what I just realized? wait woah woah woah  coffee cake doesn't even have coffee in it Why this it's a whole coffee cake if it doesn't have coffee in it hold on hold on hold on. Let's google it Because they're meant to go well with coffee, okay, but everything goes well with coffee, so I don't understand the point but you know what that means that means while this is baking we have to make it coffee now that it was brought to my Attention that coffee cake is meant to be eaten with coffee you best believe that I'm going to make a coffee I like to make my coffees double shot of espresso. I like my coffee nice, and rich how I like my men Sorry, I had to make that joke oh Did you see that happen oh, yeah lookee here Yes, I still use ice trays. I don't want to hear anything about it. You ready dananana oh its dripping down my arm up its dripping  down my arm boom. Iced almond milk latte baby. Oh This is so good. Holy shit the coffee cake won't be done for another like 25 minutes I have to like make this last for the next 25 minutes of use is not gonna happen So I'm gonna stick it in the fridge Hopefully the ice doesn't melt too much. We'll see I'll see you in 25 minutes when the cake is done Kind of like late at night, and I should not be screaming right now. She's done I also am a little bit concerned because I feel like there's a potential that I might not have baked it Well enough like it might not be like completely baked all the way through now that we're done putting the cinnamon sugar glaze on top It doesn't end there we have to make the icing slash glaze And I'm not excited about this because I'm kind of like tired of cooking this has been a hard recipe and I'm just like I want to just lay down looks like feta cheese I Love feta cheese. Do you guys like feta cheese? I think it's so fucking good. I don't know I think it's like really underrated I feel like a lot of people kind of just like sleep on feta cheese like they don't like talk about it also this recipe Calls for honey, but as we all know honey comes from bees in that It's not vegan, so we're using maple syrup instead you're welcome sisters James Charles is so quaking right oh? My god. I can't believe I just said sisters. I literally that just slipped out naturally. That's so scary bullshit. Okay anyway boom I am so excited right now. Let's just slice right into it. I don't even think it's fully cooked. It's still raw no Do I do no putting it back in the oven for a few more minutes? No. I'm so upset. It's literally raw This is literally just like hot batter. I literally didn't cook it all I really put this one up I'm gonna put it in the oven for another 15 minutes If I burn it I didn't burn it But all I can do is just pray that I fix it a little bit because this cooking with Emma is going south really fucking Quick so I'm gonna put it back in the oven and I'll see you in like 15 minutes when it's like probably gonna be Burnt because knowing my luck. It'll probably be burnt, but wish me luck Oh god It's literally soup it's wet it's literally wet like Okay, that was stupid like literally look at this it just gets flat It's disgusting look at it the way that it splatters. It just f*cking flattens out. I am so upset Let's get the full taste test experience. here's the coffee. Okay, this coffee's fuckin bomb as hell. Now let's try some of this ranky ass No, it tastes like ass. You know why? I think it's because I used applesauce instead of eggs I guess that applesauce didn't make the cut the last cooking with emma i did was a hot mess, but this one's actually worse and I didn't even think it was possible everything just sinks in it Look at that f*king sh*t! It f*king disappears in it it's literally play dough watch me fucking build a house with this shit I just built a fucking house. Okay, that's a pyramid, but then watch Woah Are you ready? It flattens out! I'm pissed EWWW No, this is so nasty Why am I still eating it? Cooking with Emma's going downhill, and it needs to be saved. I need to redeem myself I keep getting worse usually the more that you practice the better you get but I'm getting worse as I'm practicing That's it for today's video I hope you enjoyed this video on how to make DIY brown play-doh if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe Comment down below anything you want um I love you all I appreciate you all and I can't wait to see you in the next video in my next video in the Next video in my next video, I can't wait to see you in my next video And I can't wait to see you in my next video peace  "

A nice chick Okay, a nice girl named Nicole sent me this super yummy candle. It's white mint latte from Bath & Body Works I've been burning the hell out of this as you can see I literally got it like a week ago And I've been burning it so maybe two weeks I don't know Thank You Nicole for sending that a local company from around here in the Bay Area where I live sent me a t-shirt Their clothing brand is called ""Follow your Light"". I'll link, I'll.... I'll link them down below. They have super cute shirts This is the one I have they also have a really good depop, so I'll link both of those down below I got this sweater from the Dpop. check that out. I'll leave the link in the description okay now Let's open new mail that I haven't opened yet, okay I have this entire wholefoods bag not spons. this entire bag filled with mail, so let's open some stuff. Oh shit This is huge alright. We're gonna open this one first this is from Lydia. Thank you Lydia! -GASP- I'm so excited right now! She sent me a new Starbucks tumbler, and this is huge which is so perfect for me because Literally all of mine are like the smaller size, and this one's fucking huge, and I'm so excited. Oh my god She sent me...she knows me, so well. She sent me a fucking chapstick because this bitch knows. Let's try it out Oh, my god. It smells so good. What flavor is it, pineapple? Oh, oh my god. Yes. Yes bitch. Holy shit thats pineapple-y as fuck. Thanks, Lydia! Okkkk let's see what this is this is from andrea andrea andrea. Sorry. I don't know What! It's like a chicken wing on a string she has some Q&A questions for me let's answer these. Mcdicks or Culvers? I don't know about what either of those are. I've never been to either of them. Number two pickles or avocados? pickles. Avocados, I don't mind them, but they're not my favorite. Unpopular opinion!!! Ew. Give away coffee for the rest of your life Or have a toe fetish for the rest of your life? prolly give up coffee because I don't want a foot fetish I mean if you have one don't be offended, but I don't. Last question Christmas or Thanksgiving? 100% Christmas I.... Thanksgiving is fine, but it's not my favorite so this is so fucking awesome. Thank you Bae! This is so fun. I don't know why I don't do this more often.  Okay opening this from Henry Lynn next. Stop. Holy Shit I don't think that this is from the US because this is some weird packaging. Oh I live in Belgium and the Chocolate is pretty good Wow oh, yes, we got a nice picture here. They wrote me a story I'm gonna read this later because it's super long, but I'm so excited. It's my first fanfic. I'm pretty pumped. Thank you I'm only gonna open a few more because I've already been filming for a very long time this next package is from Ellen not eh.. not degeneres oh We have a nice wood pencil. This is actually kind of dope definitely gonna use this when I wanna I don't know write down my feelings when I'm camping. Oh. Oh my god. This is so cool look at this shit How dope is that that is so freakin cool? Oh? Her name is actually Sylvie, so I put that up I think this might be a parent it says Ellen on here because Ellen is the parent thanks Ellen. I'm not Ellen fuck Thank You Sylvie you have a very cute name, I really like it this one's heaviest this is from Polina. Hopefully I'm saying that right whoo. Oh. Oh my god. There's all these products in here. Don't see what she said she sent me Oh my god a bunch of fucking products replenishing facial moisturizer gonna be using that because my skin sucks leave-in conditioner Why you guys spoiling me rosewater mask ooh fucking face mask anti-frizz serum last, but not least we have body lotion I mean, I think everybody can assume that I'm a little bit challenged when it comes to things like makeup Any sort of products by the way, I read the letters off-camera because you know what that's our secrets, okay? I don't share that with people because what if you tell me your deepest darkest secret in it? And then I read it out loud For everyone to hear that would be kind of tough wouldn't it so feeling very hashtag blessed that was just so fun And I love you guys so incredibly much But that's all I'm gonna do for that today because I've done so much of it And I've been filming for 21 minutes anyway If you want to be featured and the next time I do this go ahead and send some stuff I have my p.o. box in the description. I love opening your guys's stuff. I love reading your guys's letters. That's it for now I'll see you today. Maybe I'll see you tomorrow. I don't know I'll see you soon. I don't know what I'm gonna See you though, but I'll see you soon Good morning guys good morning. It is ten eleven today I'm gonna be going into the city, San Francisco to hang out have some lunch with my dad Maybe take some pictures with my dad or the gram cuz I'm honestly my Instagram lately has been so bad I hate my Instagram right now first. We're gonna get lunch though at a place called jus delicious I'm literally in a bush right now. Oh My god. I parked like inside of a fucking bush That is my scary neighbor And I don't want to hit her because then she would probably sue me also wearing makeup today because I'm taking photos I know you guys are probably like what the fuck Emma. Why are you wearing makeup? Let me tell you my makeup routine concealer powder and mascara. That's it so don't quake okay? I haven't worn makeup in like a month so I was like you know what, fuck it like I'm just gonna wear it today And I absolutely hate it and regret it It makes my face feel so nasty and like sticky and weird and take a sharp right turn on to Magnolia Avenue a sharp Right that scares me. What do you mean? Why the fuck is she literally taking me this way keep right to merge onto US 101? North when did I ever agree to go on 101? I picked the other route Siri you fucking stupid hoe You're a stupid hoe, but now it's too late. She directed me to the wrong place. I'm pissed anyway I don't really know what I was talking about because I just got hashtag mad as I said I hate my Instagram I didn't really go into detail, so I will now. I just think it sucks That's all the detail. I need to include Instagram does not matter It's the most unimportant aspect of my entire life, but I do think it's fun to like make it look good like aesthetic You know aesthetic hate that word I have two of those under skin pimples right now that are like you can't even really see them because they're under your skin But they're more just annoying because they hurt so bad I have one up right here and one on my lip they hurt so bad I can't pop them to like get rid of them cuz they're under my skin sorry to cut you off oops Ooops Ahhhh Guys also when I'm filming this December first happy December first do you know what I love how people get so? Christmas af on December 1st like it's literally December 1st. It's been December for like five seconds I don't even like the actual day of Christmas because then that means Christmas is over all the days leading up to Christmas There's a little bit of Hope in the air like I feel like Christmas makes me feel comforted I feel Comforted when I think about Christmas doesn't like nothing bad can happen to me because christmas is coming and that's why I like this time Of year because I feel safe I'm getting kind of a little bit hangry So it probably best if I don't talk to you until I get my food I got here before my dad so now. I'm just waiting outside. I'm embarrassed I was just applying my acai chapstick when I looked down and I realized I'm also eating acai. It's just crazy how it all happens All right we finished eating he was super good I'm not that full tough because it wasn't that filling I don't know I never get filled up by acai bowls Which means I'll be eating soon. We're gonna take some pictures now, so we're at Ocean Beach I believe it's called in San Francisco basically a beach. I can just hope that it turns out good. You can kind of see right? There wish me luck my Instagram needs help, okay It took some pics don't up. They really are gonna make the cut or not Excuse you oh my god, my dad, just put my backpack in the sand, okay, it's actually fine I guess I'll just leave it my dad really really wants to take some artsy clips for my vlog even though I don't really put artsy clips in the vlog my dad's gonna attempt to take some montage footage right now so brace yourself We're gonna try to make an artsy montage Doesn't it's not okay go ahead                 My butts wet so So look at that little guy out there look at them, but I lost him alright. Well I tried Gonna go into this cafe to edit them this cafe is called Java house, Java Beach excuse me I haven't had a coffee yet today, so I'm just praying that they have almond milk if they don't have almond milk It's gonna get brutal They have almond milk The damage has been done. Let's do the taste test, hold on.   nice! Very nice Twinning See ya later. just finished up at that cafe I could either go home, or I could hang out in the city for like two more hours Traffic doesn't start getting bad for like another two or three hours and I do want to miss the traffic because I Don't like traffic because I'm a normal human being but I don't really know where to go I have a headache so I could probably go for another coffee, and I would be fine. I put my hair up because I'm Lazy anyway, let me see what's the near here? Let me Yelp What was I gonna do oh Yeah, yelp, okay, I've been a little slow today I feel like I'm like I don't know my brains just not moving as fast as it usually does honestly Honestly I think I might just going to another coffee just because like San Francisco has so many cool Cafes that are just fun to sit in like it's just fun sitting in there I think I'm gonna go to a SUper AEstheTIC cAFe, and I'm gonna EDit some VIdEoS! I love Yelp if you hate on Yelp fuck you because you like a lot of people lately I've been hating on Yelp and like saying like Oh yelps stupid like ew who uses Yelp no no no No, no no no no I do not want to fucking hear it Yelp is so great like if you're in an area right all you have to do is type in coffee and you bouta find all Of the trendiest places not only that but with reviews Let's say you want to know if almond milk you can find that on Yelp Let's say you want to know what's on their menu Yelp. Let's say you want to know their hours Yelp Let's see you wanna. I don't know let's say you want to see a cute picture of somebody drinking their coffee at that place... YELP. Yeah, let's see you want to see a review from some pretentious middle-aged dad... yelp. this place is called streamlined coffee. I've been here a long long long long time ago like six months ago Maybe and I think it was good. I don't really care. We're going Okay, we're going hegaheheheh Turn left onto Tara pal Street. Oh oh my God an entire flock of * pigeons just literally went like straight towards my window and then at the last minute like curved up and Like all flew away. That was the scariest * of all time I literally thought I was gonna die sorry for all these random ass rants but this is just this is what you signed up for when you subscribe to my channel so winter in California is really nice because It never actually gets that cold But you do get a nice little cold crisp in the air feeling like then you get a nice crispy feeling around wintertime But I feel like people always talk about if summer Summer we only like summer no - okay winter is cool. - okay * it, *it. Oh sheesh oh I'm about to die I'm gonna die I'm about to die am I about to die I can't tell I just don't want to get hit by a bus That's all or the ways that the bus run in this area confuses the living fuck out of me And I just like don't get it okay Let's go get some coffee now.

I'm gonna have to pee so much this video Hello guys. What's up? How are you all? Hope you're doing absolutely swell. I'm so excited for today's video I mean I'm excited for every video Who am I kidding, but like this one I'm super excited for because this video is just gonna be me trying different coffee drinks Today, I'm gonna be channeling my inner coffee critic, and I will be trying some of San Francisco's World-renowned coffee drinks that they're famous for-- I looked on Yelp and found three of the most iconic, famous, trendy coffee drinks that San Francisco has to offer--they all have something in common They're all overpriced, and I haven't tried any of them before in my life. I drink a s*** ton of coffee I consider myself a respectable coffee drinker I think that I have the authority to judge these coffees respectively-- Respectively-- I don't--okay-- why am I using words that I don't know how to use, I've been trying to make My vocabulary better, but I just I'm starting to realize it's not gonna happen It'll kind of make more sense once you see how f****** weird these drinks are okay? Whatever. Do you know you can't you guys go? What's going on? For the first place that we're going to-- we're going to a coffee place called Andy town coffee roastery-- Roasters? I don't f****** know. Sorry. I'm a little bit confused Hi The drink that I'm getting from there is called the snowy plover or some s***. Now this drink is famous because it's so f****** weird, but supposedly it tastes really good Let me explain to you what this drink is, so this drink is basically sparkling water, a shot of espresso, brown sugar syrup, and their homemade famous whipped cream--yeah Honestly, that sounds kind of gross to me. I don't quite understand that combination, but supposedly it's super good. It's so famous I've seen so many pictures of it online whenever I've ever been to this coffee shop I've always seen other people drinking it. This is their most popular drink It's like something that I feel like all coffee Experts should have under their belt from what I'm seeing on Yelp people travel far and wide to get this specific coffee drink So I'm pretty excited to try it out trying to drive and there's a freaking roadblock in the way-- A freaking roadblock and I'm very frustrated right now, you know I'm having to make a definite detour here Oh, there's somebody's f****** dog running in the street. That is so bad. Well. I wasn't even close to hitting the dog Thank God, I would never forgive myself, ever I would literally die. That almost kind of happened because somebody left their f****** dog run loose in the literal middle of the street I'm literally reporting them to peta-- because PETA whatever because I do not stand for that. That is so offensive Absolutely appalling that somebody would ever let their small little fluffy puppy run in the f****** Street I am so upset right now. I could not believe my eyes. I'm suing sorry shut up I almost got hit by a bus Why does this happen to meet every time after time -  shut up, Siri! I know you're helping me, shut up. Me every time somebody tries to help me with a life problem And they have my best interest at heart But I just shoot them down anyways-- aw that's so cute Finding parking around here is literally like harder than like finding a boyfriend for me That's like and that says a lot cuz like it's really hard for me to find a boyfriend cuz I'm so ugly I am so confused, it's good. No, it's not The only good part about it is the whipped cream the whipped cream is intensely good, super thicc, but the actual drink itself tastes horrible bitter, sour-- I'm feeling Disappointed I'd rate that drink a three out of ten at most, it was not great I was not a fan of it at all. I wanted to like it Maybe my taste buds aren't intelligent enough for it or something. I don't know I did not like it I don't know. Why in the f****** world they are famous for that drink because I've been to that exact coffee and Andy Town Coffee before and gotten an iced almond milk latte And I can promise you that it was 100 million times better than that drink. First, let's talk flavor-- flavor was just not good, the base of it was just f****** weird. I don't know I think the sparkling water kind of like threw me off a little bit because you know one like sparkling water has been sitting out For a really long time, and it kind of starts to get that weird like carbonated flavor That's like what that tasted like mixed with super bitter Espresso mixed with really f****** good whipped cream reason why I could actually drink a little bit of it was because the whipped cream was F****** unbelievable like I could literally just eat that whipped cream like with a spoon for like the rest of my life It was so good vanilla-y and just oh. It was so good. Probably the best whipped cream I've ever tried. At least they have that going for them I would overall give it a three out of ten at most, I would give it like a 1 out of 10 But like the whipped cream was so good that I just like whatever I don't often kind of branch out with my coffee drinks And I usually stick to what I like which is a nice almond milk latte And I kind of been starting to realize why it's because everything else f****** sucks You know when you taste something and you're like, I don't like that, but I can kind of understand Why somebody else would-- this I can't even picture that, this is like no I don't even know how anybody would want why anyone would like this my stomach kind of feels weird now Maybe it's because I'm so upset So for our next drink We're gonna be going to--I don't know where we're going I have to look--flywheel coffee roasters, flywheel coffee roasters is Famous for their siphon coffee, it's basically I'll insert like a picture or video of like the machine that makes it. It's like this really weird old-fashioned like coffee vacuum That's what they describe it as it brews using like fire and like vacuum power and s*** I did not understand it whatsoever I saw a video of it And I was just like holy it like that is so dope but like I don't understand it at all I don't know the benefits of it like how it tastes different than regular coffee that was like never Discussed and like I couldn't find anything, but I think the main reason why it's so Dope is because the process of making it look so f****** cool, and I'm just like excited to see them make it It's like six bucks Though which is like super expensive But I'm not mad because it kind of makes sense like if you see that machine like I bet those things are so expensive-- vacuum Coffee maker brews coffee using two chambers where vapor pressure and vacuum produced coffee-- that is completely over my head So I don't know hopefully it's good. It is hot coffee, and I am a huge fan of cold coffee I've done my iced coffee rant in a video before but I'll do it briefly now the window of drinkable Temperature with a hot drink is so short It's either too hot too cold or a perfect place in the middle But it's only at that perfect place in the middle for like five minutes You either drink your entire coffee right then or you're freakin screwed, an iced coffee on the other hand it's nice refreshing And it's at like a drinkable temperature for like thirty minutes and like the only problem is is when the ice melts But like it takes a long time for the ice to melt so like that's not as much of an issue, also I think coffee tastes better cold I think that the notes are brought out better because I feel like your taste buds when the coffee is hot, the coffee burns your Tongue so you can't even taste the coffee half the time because your tongues fuckin burnt iced coffee You can actually taste the notes because your tongue isn't being Scorched and your taste buds aren't being freakin destroyed you can actually like enjoy the coffee drink and not be like oh You know what I mean, but anyway. I have my own coffee from home here That's gonna cleanse my palate because that last drink was fucking upsetting Okay, so they give me this whole thing and then also some in the mug which I think is really good But they give you a really small amount I think because I think it's really rich coffee I'm not really exactly sure but like look how dope this like science like frickin flask is? Woah good, it's just like black coffee though I feel like it just tastes like a really good French press, but French press is like you could do that at home I don't know. I think it's good I don't know if it's worth like six dollars, but I think that the experience is cool, and it would make a good photo But I think that it's a little bit. It's a little bit much for what it is. I think it's kind of cool I think that the whole like experience is cool, and I think that that's what makes it worth the money But it's like pretty smooth coffee though. I feel like it's like it goes down easy you know I Know I kind of talked while I was in there So you kind of already got the gist but likes I wouldn't do it again But I think I'm like glad that I did it so I'd rate it like a six out of 10 it looked like I was Watching like a chemistry experiment experience experiment But I don't feel like it tasted so Amazing or like so different than just like a regular cup of coffee that like I don't know and it also it was just black Coffee like how good can just black coffee be didn't excite me. Okay? It didn't excite me despite. We are off to our next place Okay, so this last coffee place. We're going to is called ritual I've been here before it's actually one of my favorite coffee shops of my life. I really like it I've never tried any of their specialty drinks, so one of Ritual's most famous drinks Is a nitro-- This is becoming a problem-- is their nitro cold brew which is basically like nitrogen infused coffee I guess nitrogen makes it cold so it's like kind of like iced coffee, but like without the ice I don't really exactly know what it is all. I know is that it looks really cool, and I heard it's really good Nitrogen is an element I think and I'm pretty sure the atomic number is seven don't quote me on that if I'm editing this and the atomic number isn't Seven I'm gonna be really embarrassed, but if it is that I'm gonna feel like a fucking gangster, so we'll see Anyway yeah, I took chemistry last year so suck my dick. I don't know how they infuse it I don't know how the process works, but you sure it's really overpriced as well so we're just really dropping the big bucks on coffee today, but It is what it is so There's some people getting into a physical fight. Okay. That's so bad. Oh no no That makes me so uncomfortable guys break it up. That's always disturbing You know watching other people just fight each other in the street just in the broad of daylight on a Monday I mean, I don't know just a little disturbing that's their thing. Okay. That's their thing. You know what I mean I'm not gonna judge. What do you think they're fighting about guys? What do you think? What do you think who's watching this right now? What do you think I think that they were fighting--that was scary --Maybe they're fighting because one of them sold the other ones girlfriend or boyfriend. I don't judge. Maybe they're fighting because They didn't pay their rent on time. I don't know maybe they don't even have rent to pay maybe they live at home Maybe they don't have a home. I'm sorry. This is kind of getting offensive. Oh my god. Oh That for a second. I thought that that guy was just literally snorting cocaine but he was actually just playing the harmonica Do you know what I shouldn't judge-
 see that's my own character flaw I'm judging people you know what a guy was trying to play his harmonica in peace And I'm just like judging him thinking that he's snorting cocaine that is so rude of me I should have never assumed that I bet that guy would never do cocaine ever I bet he's just playing harmonica I described my wheels that's Karma. That's car. I don't know what I did, but it's Karma I also just found parking so easily, and I'm so fucking excited about it, and it's also free parking, but we're here now So let's go check it out Okay, just finished at ritual sorry I didn-- I was too lazy to set up my camera for the last time so really skimping y'all out today But what can we do honestly I was just disappointed again like it just didn't Float my boat like it was fine like it would be better with almond milk. I mean I think the only cool part about it Is that like it's cold? Without ice cubes in it because like the nitrogen makes it cold like that's the only cool part about it And it doesn't really taste that good It just was honestly kind of sour and like when my coffee sour I get fucking pissed so now I just have a shit ton of caffeine in my blood and that's basically that uhm but anyway I tried hopefully the lighting isn't that bad because it's five o'clock and it's already like pitch-black out almost not really But like kind of so yeah I'd rate the last one like a 2 out of 10 because I'm just so like-- even though It didn't taste bad It was just so fucking boring and it was overpriced, and I just like I don't know I just miss my ice almond milk lattes. I think the main thing that I learned I Just I can't drink anything but iced almond milk lattes--this video I don't know. It was kind of weird, but it was a it was an adventure. I hope you had fun I know I had a little bit of fun. I hope you weren't bored if you were give it a thumbs up No, just kidding But if you did enjoy it or for some reason you weren't bored give it a thumbs up, subscribe to my channel, comment down below anything you want, don't try any of these I mean. Yeah. don't. you're gonna Go to a coffee shop get an iced almond milk latte, and thank me later a trendy doesn't mean tasty And that is what we learned today, but anyway. Love you all appreciate you all and I'll see you next time peace Oh, that was so embarrassing. That was so corny. I am so embarrassed"

I think I'm gonna have a bagel made with special Wheat of course because we're special in this family these are my special wheat bagels they are made out of sprouted wheat which is Better for you, so take notes In the past I've cut my fingers really bad trying to cut bagels I cut this middle finger like in half Trying to cut a bagel, so I'm trying to get better about my techniques so that I don't actually cut off a literal limb I'd say that was a pretty clean job If you're wondering what I put on top, I put on top vegan butter so yeah This one is called Earth Balance made with olive oil It's probably really bad for you, so like don't comment on health tips down below. I'm just doing my goddamn best, okay Here's my outfit currently really diggin it. I'm loving this new fucking turtleneck who is she? oh my god, so good. You would think after such a hectic morning I would give myself a break, but hell no I have errands to run and so we have to do that It's 12:30 now most of my errands are not necessary errands like they don't need to happen But I'm doing them anyways. Do I need to go shopping more? I already went shopping this morning.  No, I don't. Fuck, there's literally a cop behind me. Oh, bro. Oh shit. Oh shit There's a cop There's a cop. I'm not doing anything illegal, but anyways first errand I have to run is I have to go to the post office This one's actually a mandatory errand like I actually have to do this There's like a box that I have to pick up from the post office I have to go to Target because I basically Rearranged my room so the way that it was arranged before was just like not logical I don't know why I decided to do it like that, but now then it's like that I don't have like a light that like shines on to it, so I need to get a lamp okay Do you know what, moral of the story is I got to get a fucking lamp? You don't care about the logistics. I need a lamp okay? so i'm going to get a lamp from Target because they have really good lamps so after that I'm gonna go to Another mall because I know I went to a mall earlier, but there's like two malls So I'm gonna go to another mall and see if they have any cool sales or anything like that because it's still Black Friday It's only 12:30 the other day I accidentally ran a red light like because I thought that I was at an intersection that had a stop signs But it was actually an intersection that had traffic lights and so I ran a red light on accident luckily There's no one on the road And it was in like a super remote beach town so like doesn't matter like no one was around so it's like fine But still it kind of freaked me the fuck out I was like I just ran a red light like there's no and there's no way to like justified either It was just like who allowed me to get my license. I don't know They should be sued if that happened that was just kind of traumatizing I mean it wasn't a big deal, but it was traumatizing I found a bunch of really good new music lately, and I'm just like digging it Let me know down below if you guys want to play this video. I know put it down that before I'm at the post office my P.O. box isn't very close to my house so I feel like drive to get to it and it kind of takes a while because I didn't want to get one close to My house cuz just in case  like  somebody wanted to stalk me. You know that would be stupid So I went in there and it turns out I'm so fucking stupid I guess I already like picked up that box I already picked it up i guess forgot that I picked it up or I think it was like in my I don't know anyway So it's kind of stupid I kind of came here for no reason, but that's fine because there's a target really close to here And I'm so excited to go to target because target just gives me every Good vibe yet ok this song I had already played it once And I'm doing this very briefly because I think I'm gonna make a playlist video because I'm having way too much fun right now even Though I just kind of showed you all the songs that I like so light in 1 mile No joke
There's something about the sound at the beginning of this song that literally just like it's the vibe that it's just like you feel like You can conquer the world you feel like you just want to go on a road trip you and just like get lost with like your boyfriend That's really fucking hot He's outdoorsy and he'll just like build you a fucking like fort out of leaves and bricks and fucking leaves you just want to like be free with nature because you are a Flower child that is just how the song makes you feel and like I'm just living for that fucking vibe so you're welcome I don't know why it's just so fucking good to be stopped doesn't the beginning of that song just make you feel like that like I'm sorry and if it doesn't then I'm honestly gonna be so fucking annoyed so i don't expect us to agree on everything But that's one thing that's like genuinely mandatory and like I don't know like if you don't feel like that about that song Maybe sometimes you know what sometimes it might take time Let it marinate for a few days listen to the song by yourself a few times Maybe think about your ideal boyfriend that builds things out of leaves, maybe think about that if you don't agree. I'm going to be pissed. Thank you, never dabbing again. Never dabbing again ever We get it you're rich shut up we're here We are here everybody the destination is on your right target. I'm aware arrived. Yeah I know. I don't know I'm kind of in a sassy mood. I woke up at 5:30 in the morning I mean, that's maybe part of it. I haven't taken a nap yet. I'm starting to feel like An angry three-year-old. I don't know I think angry three-year-old is one of my character traits, but I think right now Especially this okay, never do not I'm always so mean no. I'm not always like that That's much like bitch out that lady for like standing in the middle of the road with her cart blocking everybody else But you know what I really shouldn't because what if she had a bad day today You know what I mean like what if she genuinely was having a shitty day she came to Target to lift her mood and like what if I just like jump up on here and Judge the fuck out of her wouldn't tell I mean she wouldn't know that I was pissed But like you know what if I got pissed at her she had a hard day All she's trying to do is have some fun at Target, and I'm here judging the kind of her I feel like an asshole. You know what that's that's the lesson of the day don't judge someone You know what if they're having a shitty day And I know that that's something that we all know and I know that that's something that we all do Hopefully might forget like you know if you see somebody and they're driving a smart car or maybe they're driving a Prius You want them because their car is just so Pretentious just you know think about it like this what have they ever done. What is their car ever done to it? Why are we so against smart cars and praises? They're actually good for the environment, and they get like such good gas mileage I mean I make fun of Prius is all the time But I'm starting to think honestly maybe when I'm older I'll get a Prius and I care about this earth Why am I having literally like an? Emotional religious awakening all of a sudden, I'm just realizing things That's what target does to you speaking of which let's go inside Okay, not to be cliche or annoying, but like I'm genuinely happy and excited to be here I know it's just like everybody kind of says like oh my god target I live there like target is my home like I genuinely love it here. Okay. I almost got hit by a car To be completely honest they kind of forgot what I'm here for I'm getting the lamp Yeah, what come over here say, what's up? Hi? I love that So far I've been here for about 20 minutes, and I found officially nothing that I needed that I can't care for at all I'm cut pissed because there's you don't have the lamp that I won't want it Actually, I didn't even like having lamp in mine, but they didn't have any good ones. I feel like an angry middle-aged mom Excellence cart oops Hi, I'm having no luck finding Bobby so I mean it could potentially be because I don't use soap often So I don't know where to find it Okaywe I'm like feeling really I feel like I Said I'm really sketched out from going like there really sketch. Yeah, I'm getting out look. I I think it's fine I'm just really paranoid, and they're like They're hoods in like sunglasses. I feel like they're gonna steal or something or me. I feel they're gonna kid me kidnapping No, they were like following me and walking around weird, and I'm like over this I'm the leg leaving I'm leaving now But I'm like far. I'm so far from the door like I need to get this lamp. Yes. Ma'am oh? my god That was so fucking scary. Okay. Let me lock my doors like I'm really dramatic so like it probably was nothing But I get super paranoid, and I have like really Really intense gut feelings. I was walking around Target Okay, and basically I noticed these men two men both with like kind of wavy hair in ponytails Kind of low on their head okay this description doesn't matter But I just feel like if they do something this description might be worth while later because they're sketchy And I'm not a fan of them whatsoever. They're wearing sunglasses. I think they were wearing hoods, but I can't remember They're wearing like cargo shorts, which is just like a sign of a serial killer I saw them like three times throughout my time being in target the way that they were like had their bodies curved their body language Was enough to put me over the edge, but I just kind of was like whatever like it's Black Friday Everybody had like a long night yesterday or whatever then I saw them again And like they were still kind of shuffling around the store like they didn't have a cart or anything They were just like walking around the store being Suss I was feeling even more Uncomfortable because I was like okay like why are they just like walking around the store lurking But not actually buying anything or doing and turning left to merge onto then I like saw them for the last time He was right behind me like walking towards me and like that shit just No But I was like not okay with it, so I've in dip squad But like even if somebody is completely innocent like I will be paranoid that they're trying to kill me like that's just like in 1.5 miles That's just like a fun fact about me if they were just like unusual people and I just like wrongly judge them like I'd feel Like an asshole, but like if they do something bad like on the store like I'm gonna feel even worse So I don't really know morally what to do, but I'm just kind of glad that I'm out of there And hopefully everyone else is okay Don't know what they're up to don't want to know if they're following me if they put a microchip and be you're some shit I'll find that and I'll burn it since my exit. Yeah, we're going to the mall I'm not like super big on going to the mall right now like I'm not I don't really know exactly why I'm going my like inner dot feeling is saying like go to the mall go to the mall go To the mall someone wants to let me in these lanes are merging you stupid bitch. Thank you. Ma'am Thank You MIT No, no no No don't like let me in and then like last minute decide to like and cut me off like who are you I'm going to the Mall right now. I don't know if you heard the news, but it's Black Friday Uh-huh yay, I'm so excited I'm here The only stores that I'm gonna go here. Oh shit probably for 21 hmm Maybe I'll go to zoomies if I'm really in the mood. No. I'm just getting zoomies sucks No offense to you zoomies even though when people say no offense. It makes me more offended personally. You don't have fun The only one zoomies never has good sales like I always am like hell Maybe I'll go in there and get like a Thrasher hoodie cuz I'm a huge skater But then the sales suck so but y'all go into packs on that's really it like packs on for everyone Nordstrom I don't know. I'm kind of like I'm not burnout on shopping, but like cuz that's impossible physically for me but I'm definitely kind of like getting a little bit I Don't know the emotion. I can't put it into words. Also. There's a no-parking Which makes sense I mean that's fine like normally. I'd be so pissed, but I kind of get it. It's Black Friday Oh Jim what wait a second is there really no parking at all oh no wait actually maybe fuck this I might actually go home Oh shit. No you can't do that ah That was the most annoying thing I've ever seen I'm mad okay. I'm gonna try to go to the North Stromer parking lot Okay, you guys don't care about this Who am I kidding? That was a very short mall trip, I went into forever 21 pack songs all that on the sales We're just not that great and the lines were super long like so long I'm just feeling wrecked as I think that always happens to me when I wake up super early because like only 2:30 But I'm just feeling so Exhausted and tired like I don't even want to drive home, and I'm so hungry. I'm just like having a lot of mixed emotions"

Just kidding, who am I kidding? I didn't brush my teeth. That's for losers, and my hair is in a bun that's just disgusting like look at that ThErE's LiTeRaLlY bUgS iN tHeRe Today, me and my friend Grace are gonna go do a little *stutters* We're gonna do a little bit of Black Friday shopping and personally, I don't need anything But of course I always want things so that's gonna be fun after that I don't know, but let's just think about the task at hand here texted her this morning And I was like yo like you awake And I was kind of hoping that she wouldn't respond and then I can go back to bed I was kind of hoping that she like wouldn't respond and then I could go back to bed, but you know what she's up I'm up. I know it's good for us. This is fun. This is an adventure Let's gooo, and I'm also going absolutely so blind from this flash from my phone Okay, b**ch I'm already up Emma: Are you ready to die Grace: YEESSS How do you have this energy at like 5:30 am??? I don't know. I just don't know. I wouldn't expect this enthusiasm from anybody else about shopping though. I feel like we like both like f**ckin' love this sh*t Yeah, this is gonna be so fun GOOD MORNING URBAN OUTFITERS, I""M HERE FOR ALL OF YOUR SALESSS *teenage excitment* There's no one in here, this is made for us. There's no one in here She does not want to be working today, she had the morning shift she's like no I'm not going. I kinda want a denim skirt like I don't know oh, this is like low key. No, that's weird this these oh, what's this? Are they trying to play like serene music this morning so that we like don't like panic Oh, it's fanny pack central, but the worst thing about it Is that these fanny packs are freaking huge Grace put your hand next to it like see how these compare to her hand see? Real to scale girls is sweater weather guys is like fanny pack season What do you meme? Jay thieves is quaking because my vocals are just like I don't know we finished that urban and we've been driving around for the past Like no joke 20 minutes. Also. My skin's super oily. I'm so sorry for your little bit sweaty out here No, we out here running boy. Everything's freaking closed There's nothing it's so upsetting so we literally we just drove to Brandi closed We drove to North drop closed mind you they're all like five minutes away So it's not like really good doing like a major detour But now we're gonna go get pressed Free People and all that stuff opens at 8:00, and it's like 7:20 So like we're just gonna wait also the thing is like Grace you have like a You have a brunch at what time 9:00? So like we have to, we--- This is not like--- We don't have time to spare here. We have to shop So I bought some stuff from urban, but I'll do a haul later, but grace would like pick something up And she's like this reminds me of you, and I'm like grace. How do you know? I'm like okay, put it in my cart I got like really good because grace found all of it you actually did find all of it like every single item moral of the story is Black Friday isn't what it used to be they don't open early like they owned evolution No one gives a there's been no what there's no one here but you know I think the whole thing was the whole point of it used to be that it was fun because it was the hype, but now that the hypes dead, like, I'm dead. Oh wait, this is getting awkward already *Nope* Okay, so just one disappointment after the other they didn't have any toppings so we had to just get juice like a literal pussy So far we've had kind of a disappointing So far we've had kind of a disappointing day everything has failed us We just went to press and they didn't have any toppings ready. Press was our safe zone. We're like well Press opens at 7:00 Yeah, we got breakfast yeah And I was like, ""Do you guys always like not have toppings?"" They're like, ""No, just today."" It's like, do you know what? I had a rough start and I still have my toppings If you don't know what a press freeze is I'll insert a picture. It's like basically I'll put it right here It's gonna be funny. It's basically like vegan frozen yogurt It's so good and like they just but yeah, they didn't have any toppings, so I just feel like topping-less now Like I have I feel naked. I feel stripped of my dignity All right, so I'm gonna start a new thing on my channel called. See you in the next clip. It's gonna go a little something like this All right guys, see you in the next clip. It is 8 o'clock It is go time. It is go time. We're at free people to start well not even to start This is our second store of the day We saw a girl standing outside And then we saw the lady like unlock the door and like let her in and so then we were like oh shit like they're Open but no it was a staff member coming in we're just three minutes or three minutes away Can they really just not open the door for us right now? Wow, he will see you in like 3 minutes when free people actually opens so sucks I Like saw really cute shirt nose like oh, it's so cute, and then I looked at the price and $120 I'm like no no Black Friday sale can make that worth it for me. We're going to Bloomingdale I just heard that they have some espresso machines here on sale And you best believe we going in here to see hi We're the espresso machines I'm a coffee addict, and I need to feed my addiction. Hi I drink coffee. What are you drinking? Oh wait, I almost just ask somebody who's shopping here. I almost asked her. I was like hi. I'm where's the espresso machines I'm a coffee addict. What are you addicted to cocaine? No. That's a joke. Where are the stairs that? See yeah great, so let's just go up those um we're like the likeness frescoes and stuff like that On this floor Oh perfect miss pres. Oh keep it warm for me. No nobody's here. Nobody's in the Bloomie's I'll let you know okay, Juna. I need to focus. I need to focus There oh there. She is Wow I am absolutely ecstatic about this purchase It was on sale for 60% off. Yeah, you heard that right people say it louder for the people in the back 60% off so good luck trying to oh my god lies my only my nostrils are lit up now We're going to brandy melville again to see if they're open now I'm just praying that they're open if they're not I don't know what we're gonna do the holy Purchasing the nespresso that hold like kind of thing was just so stressful, and it was just intense trustful There's a really sweet woman in front of us who is buying two Nespresso. He's two of them She was just taking forever to check out. I think her credit card was declining I don't know. I mean my credit card would be declining true. I was buying two Nespresso recoop on like every percent every saving ninety dollars No Way I got both them per night. He knows like how they know she basically got one for free because those were both $90 That's insane no wonder it took so long. Okay. I'm sorry. You know. I should never judge an extreme couponer by her coupons I shouldn't of judged because guess what? I paid 150 bucks for mine It's it's closed. It's closed. It's closed It's fucking closed we are officially having the worst luck so basically that was a huge disappointment. Okay going home Now okay, so I'm home now. I just got back from the mall Obviously you know I'm no like fashion guru on the interwebs but like I thought it'd be fun if I showed you anyways because like why not I don't know if you care probably not but I'll show you anyways I went to urban and I did get a few things from urban I think that's a place that I scored the best at as you know the lot of stores Just weren't open so like I didn't even like we didn't get to go to Brandi so I probably would have bought stuff there But like that wasn't open. There's no forever 21 at this mall. There's no H&M There's no anything like that so like that wasn't really in the cards first thing. I got was this denim skirt It's a little bit looks like something a mom would wear but I'm like kind of living for it it like fits really well Has like a zipper in the back. Next we got this oh my god I am a huge lover of a turtleneck We love turtlenecks I got this freaking huge color blocking kind of like hoodie turtleneck And I am just so excited about this because it's just super soft and cozy And I feel like wow I just I want more stuff like that. Oh shit. I got some good deals I saved like 30 bucks. That's pretty good. Then next they have like this kind of like vintage line or whatever I've gotten like a few pairs like shorts and stuff from the vintage line But I haven't like gotten that much from it And so I got this like I don't know I love these kinds of tops like this just kind of like buttons boyfriend shirt fit kind of looking shirt I love them because I don't know I feel like they have like a really cool vibe I just think of it like something about like the men's shirt look. I love it Even though I already look like a 12 year old boy, and it just like emphasizes it last But not least another turtleneck because as I told you I literally love turtlenecks it's my favorite fall Vegetable is a turtleneck my favorite fall. My favorite fall vegetable is a turtleneck. I got this nice little stripes You can't really obviously can't feel it through the screen. It's not a scratch-and-sniff, but it's really soft Just cute blue Navy and red stripes supersoft have I said that enough I am a sucker for soft stuff last place I went to is free people they weren't really having a good sale But like whatever I got this like black basic cami boring no one cares, and I got this like kind of like sports bra But like not it's like a top and it's like low in the back I know I think it's kind of dope and it was like 15 bucks And it was like originally like 40 and it was in like the sales section and the sales section was 25% off I hate when like places like their Black Friday deal is like making the sale section on sale. I'm like okay What's the point of that I missed the days when everything would open at 6 a.m. And like we would all just like pile in the car, and just like go to the store But like now everything opens at like 8:00 or like later And I'm like what's the point of that and like the sales suck, so I don't know Black Friday Is dead, but what can you do Oh yeah
Of course how can I forget my last thing my last thing that I bought is my favorite thing of all time an espresso now Let's just talk about this for a second see I as you know. I'm a coffee connoisseur I've been dreaming of getting an es--- I've been dreaming of getting an espresso machine for like months, okay I've always I've wanted one for a very long time, but the other day I was at my grandparents house, and they actually have an espresso And I was like wow that is something else I need to get me one of those so I talked to my mom and I'm like hey if I see one on Black Friday can I snatch that and she's like yes So I got that for like I think it was like 60% off or something, so it was only 150 bucks not too Shabby after this I'm gonna go take a shit, and then we're gonna try to use it. Oh, I'm just so excited I'm so excited. I could literally cry also I'm not doing like a gift exchange in my family like my family is just not doing gifts this year me and my parents like We're not really doing gifts cuz I just don't need anything and I just like don't feel like it's like worth it I feel like everybody just gets stressed out over what they want to get one another and it just like becomes like a Negative thing like it's not as fun and I think people enjoy the Christmas time more when gifts aren't involved It makes you enjoy the gift of the holiday season more Oh my god that noise oh god. Let's read the directions. By choosing espresso, you join a passionate global community of coffee lovers That's what I like to hear. There are many advantages to owning an espresso machine and delicious coffee every day is just one of them Obey all safety messages that allow this symbol to avoid possible injury, or death. Okay, so I might die while setting this up I have to pee so bad, but I want to do this, so I'm not gonna go pee. How do I fuckin do this Okay, we have the water tank setup.This is pretty complex So far I haven't died yet, so I think I'm doing pretty good How do you, how do you turn it on? Oh it's on! Oh my god. It's cleaning itself. It's gonna clean itself It's vibrating extremely Okay, that was kind of scary Okay, so I've successfully cleaned the machine internally, so now it's time to make a coffee the machine is completely setup I am so ecstatic. Take some almond milk This isn't normally the one I use, but we're using it today. Okay That's maybe a little bit too much, but like what can you do? Look at this. Are you ready? I have a mini little espresso cup. Look how cute this is no way I'm so excited This is not sponsored by an espresso, but I wish it was now Here's how you make the iced almond milk latte. Guys, keep your dicks in your pants, okay? Take your nice espresso right and you pour it right over the top and you got a iced almond milk latte from home Baby, you don't even know how excited I am right now. Look at this. Look at that beautiful I can't believe that I'm doing this from the comfort of my own home That was probably one of the best purchases in my life. I'm not kidding. I've never spent my money on something better. Ah It's that I heard like you know the bomb sound where it's like I heard that and then the whole apartment shook. It could have been my imagination because I mean, I am--- I do have an active one so Okay, that scared me. I literally thought we were getting bombed. The bay area where I live has some bomb threats But we won't talk about that because that's not appropriate. It's 9:45 a.m. that is so early. Normally I wake up at this time on the weekends, so like that's Kind of wild. Um, it's been about five minutes already ready for another one So I'm just--- I don't know. I'm--- this is a bad, this is bad for me. I can have espresso whenever I freakin' Oh, oh no! Ahh! Yes. NO! *lots of other incoherent screaming* I PRESSED THE BIG BUTTON! I MESSED IT UP! DANGIT! uMMM, anyways... So I meant to make like a little cup like this big But I accidentally pressed the big cup button so it overflowed so I had to use this But this actually looks so dope that was like one of the stupider (?) things that I've done I like looked and I was like, ""why is it like not stopping now?"" Now I feel like the kitchen's a mess. Okay, I'll clean it Ooh she thicc second coffee of the day baby oh We have made a serious mess of ourselves here. How am I even gonna clean this? This is like the bottom like thing. Look, it's completely filled with fucking coffee wait That's actually filled with coffee that I could literally drink. I'm drinking it. I'm not wasting it. I--- Mm-hmm I don't know if that's sanitary Since when have I ever cared about sanitary stuff. Bone apple tit"

Check out his channel!! - https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-11-24T01:28:38Z,103306,3132977,2854,"Hello and Happy Thanksgiving Happy Thanksgiving guys today's video, I wasn't sure what I was gonna do but I was at Whole Foods, and I saw this vegan Thanksgiving ""roast"" that's basically like a fake little Roast and it kind of inspired me that you know what what if we just do a nice little Thanksgiving feast you know why don't We just kind of chow down together. Let's say you don't live in the US and you don't celebrate Thanksgiving I'm gonna give you a taste of what it is like in the typical American family We're gonna do some cooking, we're gonna do some eating and, most importantly, we're gonna do some talking, particularly uncomfortable Talking, because if you have ever had a Thanksgiving dinner, You know the relatives love to just really ask you things that you don't want to answer. I'm pretty excited I'm doing all the cooking by myself because I'm an independent woman And I'm gonna do all the eating myself too because I'm also an independent woman. Anyways. Let's go to the kitchen Let's go um channel some Guy Fieri vibes actually No, not Guy Fieri because he eats way too much meat and this is vegan So let's channel some Frelee the banana girl vibes. Okay. Oh, it's kind of sagging a little bit Not only is the directions for this kind of complicated it also takes like an hour to cook and that's just So much time, and I am hungry. Let's open up the box ew ew, look at that little poop at the end I love that they're calling this like on the directions They're calling it like the roast. This is not a fucking roast. This is a piece of tofu Jesus Christ it comes with vegan brownies and vegan gravy Yay Now I guess we just put it in the freezer I mean the yeah put it in the oven for an hour and 20 minutes I don't know what I'm gonna do until then but I'm just gonna cry and be upset. See you in an hour and 20 minutes little ham And now I guess we put this back in the oven for another 15 minutes Just when you thought that we were about to eat. No! more waiting, and I am so hungry But I'm so excited for our Thanksgiving feast Another fun thing is for the last 15 minutes of cooking we put in the nice vegan brownies I had no clue that these even like came with it. Wait a second. Let me see the directions for this shit Okay perfect the work does not end here because we have to make the gravy Yes, vegan gravy yummy. This is not sponsed. But this is the brand Tofurkey I've actually had this before like a few years ago, but I haven't had it in a long time and I'm kind of afraid of it. it says that you can either cook the gravy in the microwave or on the stovetop and Obviously, I'm gonna cook it in the microwave because I'm lazy af so... I've never been a huge gravy fan But I'm not gonna like waste it and like not make it. You know, maybe it'll be really good. Ah, ew! My family is not a huge Thanksgiving family, so I'm excited that we can celebrate together because you guys are my family, too Ew ew it smells so weird it smells really odd like ew It's really chunky, it's so chunky. We need to mix it up more. It is not ready yet today is the 22nd November 22nd. My half birthday, so I've always thought that  half birthdays were so stupid because there's like really no point to them But I guess we can say today that I am officially 16 and a half rather than just 16 16 and a half pretty old almost 17, but I still look 12 Now I just wait The Thanksgiving feast is ready I cannot wait Oh shit so let me tell you about what we have here because I know that you've kind of already seen But I want to make it very clear. so right here we have some gravy. right here we have a nice Turkey roast with some nice stuffing in it not as good as real stuffing But it's doing the job, then we have some vegan brownies for dessert cannot wait to try those out We have some cranberries because I didn't want to make cranberry sauce so I'm just gonna eat Cranberries how they are even though they're really sour and I'm probably gonna die. you might be like Emma, We don't really care about watching you eat. Let's make this more fun. How are we gonna spice this up a little bit? I'm trying to have a traditional Thanksgiving meal with you guys right now. During the Thanksgiving meals with your family What kind of conversation goes on at the table.... Uncomfortable ones Uncomfortable as fuck. what better activity for us to do during our YouTube Thanksgiving feast then for me to answer some of your guys's Uncomfortable questions that you have for me. if that doesn't make sense, I'm sorry I don't know what else to say But first let me actually try this before we start answering any questions Hmm, it's not bad. Let's try some of these cranberries Let's answer some of these questions I told you on Twitter to make them uncomfortable, so we'll see how this goes. What do your armpits smell like right now? you can only answer this with a type of candle scent. That's a crazy question Eucalyptus mint. If your iced almond milk latte started talking to you one day. What would it say? I love you, bitch I ain't never gonna stop loving you bitch. What's the most childish thing that you still do? I cry a lot um I'm pretty mature for my age. Just kidding everybody thinks I'm 12. Say an unpopular opinion. Well with the holidays coming up I think it's best that I admit to you. I don't really listen to Michael Buble during the Christmas time I'm more of a kind of 50s music sort of enjoyer when it comes to the Christmas time And so I'm really sorry to tell you that I don't listen to Michael Buble I also don't like Starbucks. Does size really matter? No of course not What juice box flavor do you feel spiritually connected with? I don't really like juice boxes, but maybe Sunny D Because you know she's a little bit tangy. She's a little bit trashy, but at the end of the day everyone loves her Have you ever had a crush on your friend's dad? No that's fuckin' gross. Mac DeMarco dance party in three two one go How many feet apart were two bros who were chillin in the hot tub that were not gay?  five feet apart! two bros chillin in the hot tub Five feet apart cuz they're not gay. If you were to choose between getting your period every single day versus eating your toenails whenever you Cut them off Which would you pick? definitely eating my toenails because I do that anyways. I would rather die than have my period every day, so Would you rather be the person doing the cheating or be the person being cheated on? I would Definitely rather to be cheated on Because at least that doesn't make me a shitty person and also everyone would feel bad for me And they would hate the person who cheated. Blondes or brunettes? see I don't have a preference But I've always kind of had a special place in my heart for blondes, but if you're brunette and you treat me right Then I'll let it slide. How much of a pain in the ass is Emma? Why are you asking me? you walk into a room with a single red button. Below it There is a label that says: ""if you press this all of the ducks in the world will be replaced with small versions of Lady Gaga, but no one else notices but you"" would you push the button? I think ducks are really cute and Lady Gaga is a little bit insane So I just don't think I'd push the button. Sorry Lady gaga. It's just uh one of you is enough Do you have a boyfriend/crush at the moment by the way my best friend and I are obsessed with your channel we love you love you guys, too I do not have a boyfriend Sadly, and I don't have a crush on anybody who knows that I exist. Cole Sprouse slide into my DM's, baby Have you ever sharted? tell us about it. I have sharted when I was on vacation in Maine I was laying in bed. This was literally two months ago. Okay. I was lying in bed watching some YouTube vids minding my own business, when all of a sudden I fart. but then I sit there for a second and realize that wasn't just a fart you know? that was my first time sharting. It's happened multiple times since and it was really disturbing, but it was hilarious I was laughing and crying at the same time because it was, okay We're not gonna talk about it anymore. slime on the first date? Honestly. I think that's kind of taking it too far. I'd save slime for like the fifth date. first date, I'd maybe do some like ASMR. Jake or Logan? Nick. ever send nudes? haha Of cours-- no. What's your most embarrassing period story? Okay I think the most embarrassing part about it, was that I literally didn't get my period until I turned 16 And I'm 16 now. Because like most people got it when they were like way younger and everybody was like ""Emma why don't you have it yet?"" and I'm like I don't fuckin' know. My body makes the decisions not my ass. These brownies are hella good, holy f*ck! These brownies are so good. First sexual experience if any? oh man my love life is all over the place. So my first sexual experience would definitely have to be the first time I tried an iced almond milk latte. It was so good that I literally ca-- Would you rather bring back vine or club penguin? here's my mentality on that. At the end of vine's life No one really even liked it anymore No one even Appreciated it. People didn't even go on it anymore and like people weren't even making vines anymore like it just wasn't what it used to be. Club penguin on the other hand. Club Penguin was thriving until the day that it died. People were still going on that sh*t and they just kind of like took it down like with no mercy Which I just think is inconsiderate and rude. Same like what they did with f*kin' toon town. They don't care about the consumer Uh, I would say bring back club penguin because vine was already dead before it died Everybody was just rewatching the old vines, which is what we do now anyway when we watch vine compilations every day So I think I'd bring back Club Penguin. or I would bring back vine, but like during its prime What's the thirty fourth photo on your camera roll? Oh my god These are old. these pictures are from when I was in like eighth grade hold on I wish it was something more funny and entertaining But it's just not. this is a picture of my cast when I broke my hand it was literally the most weird cast I've ever Seen it looked like a literal dick. So that happened. Why are you still single? See, here's the thing It's not up to me It might be because I look like I'm a 12 year old. it might be because I shower like once a week. it might be That I'm eating this entire thing of vegan brownies by myself I'm not quite sure I'm still trying to figure that out. pads, tampons or diva cups? personally I've never tried a diva cup so I have to go with the tampon. Tampon! We're really getting scandi in this video talking about tampons. Hopefully I don't get demonetized Do you ever want to get married? of course I want to get married! I just have to have some boo thang slide into my DM's first, cuz that's how all good marriages start You know what I mean? these brownies are so f*ckin' good! I literally almost ate this entire thing myself I'm proud of me. ah! no Instagram or no YouTube for a year? definitely no Instagram because Instagram is fun But like I don't even really care that much about it. I love YouTube way too much I asked you guys to ask me questions that would make me uncomfy and these just don't even make me uncomfortable And I'm starting to wonder if that's because I share too much on the Internet also I'm not gonna eat anymore because my stomach feels like it's gonna explode. Would you rather grow out your armpit hair or your toe hair? I don't like that I think that's it for today. I hope you enjoyed having a nice Thanksgiving feast with me. Celebrating with me You know the deal. I would say if you're vegan and you have pretty low standards You could definitely try out this nice little thing, that they have going here. the brownies were Worth it that's for darn sure. I hope you enjoyed if you did give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down Below anything you want. I hope you had a great Thanksgiving with your family, got to bond with them a little bit You know maybe ate some turkey. Maybe got a food coma maybe ate some pumpkin pie I don't know whatever floats your boat and also just to get a little sappy here because it is Thanksgiving and you're supposed to talk about What you're thankful for. I'm thankful for you guys. okay, bye. Love you"

Check out his channel!! - https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-11-21T21:32:57Z,38854,665547,2273,"Oh Okay, so I know you probably clicked on this video, and you expected you know I don't know what you expected, and then you saw me and you're like. Oh my god. She looks horrible. What's going on? Yeah, my life is a mess right now, and it's it's showing see these under-eye bags Yeah, those aren't always that bad, but today. Oh, they're that bad Let me just give you a little idea as to why I'm a fucking mess Well let's start out by saying originally today the day that you're watching this Tuesday I was going to be posting a Q&A with my mom well today I went to go start editing the footage and I started watching it and I was like this video is fucking ass Delete. That video was cancelled Then I was like well fuck okay. I'm now behind I gotta figure things out I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do to replace that video, so I had to figure that out So that was tiring and then just when you thought things couldn't get any worse I go into the kitchen To get some coffee, and there's fucking none in there. There's none in there. I made some oh my god I have something in my eye either that or I'm crying, and I'm just trying to make an excuse. I don't know Oh, sorry, okay? I'm actually not crying. I made some coffee Now I feel better even though, I really don't like Thanksgiving and we'll get into that in a second We're gonna be doing a Thanksgiving craft today anyway Just to get you guys into the spirit Thanksgiving is really soon And you know I'm trying to be a youtuber that fits in with the current events Do you feel me so I was at Trader Joe's. I don't know not everybody has Trader Joe's where they live, but I do Congratulations I've noticed something on Trader Joe's they like to make gingerbread houses Like a gingerbread Halloween house like the fuck that's a little bit weird because I don't know about you But I kind of like to not do weird shit, so like the fact that they're coming out with like gingerbread houses And it's not Christmas yet It's just it's a little bit wrong. Morally. Like it just it kind of questions my morals There's some sort of weird ass fucking quacking bird outside And I don't know what it is and I don't believe in animal cruelty But if I did I would shoot it with a BB gun But I don't because I'm not literally Satan Anywayy so yeah I had no ideas for like a Thanksgiving video And then when I saw this I was like do you know maybe I should just make this for a video and then like Call it a quality video. I don't know let me just explain why I don't like Thanksgiving Don't get me wrong I think it's fun to be around your family, and I think it's fun to eat food, and I think all that shit is fun But like I have a small family number one Number two I don't really like Thanksgiving food that much the only stuff I like are potatoes and pumpkin pie and like salad like I don't like Ohh stuffing is really good as long as it's vegetarian because I'm vegetarian and I know it's a sin Oh shit I opened it the wrong way. God dammit. Also I forgot to mention another reason why today sucks I set an alarm for 8 o'clock because I have so much to do today because I'm busy I woke up at fucking 11 o'clock AWGHH I mean it's probably because I was up late last night stressing out about everything either way I found it to be really disappointing that I woke up that late. Let's do a little haul first. We have powdered sugar I'm assuming that this makes the frosting they only have these fucking cheap-ass M&M looking ass, but like they look really bad so They only have fruit snacks *Disgusted* Ok that's just embarrassing, and then we have sprinkles I fuck with sprinkles Okay so update, um this video is also gonna Be really bad to make the icing like you have to make the icing yourself it calls for One egg white and see I don't have eggs at my house because I try to eat the year most of the time So we're gonna have to figure out how to make this without eggs Okay before I deal with this issue at hand let's talk about other things first. Also these candies are weakest I'm not gonna like try to find other things in my house that I can use to decorate this because I'm sorry but I don't like when things look bad I Don't even really like gingerbread. I mean, it's fine. Oh my god. Wait a second oh my god Nevermind, I think it back. I actually love it I have everything laid out nice, but now I have to go make the icing. What do you undo them? You don't even understand. You don't even notice it. Let me read you the directions for the icing. It'll just prove to you Why today is the worst day of my life okay with the egg white okay? I don't have eggs at my house stop my life stirring package of icing sugar Okay well, that's fine because I have this right here add a few drops of lemon juice or white vinegar to make that icing stickier I have both of those things so That's fine They say that you're supposed to use a hand mixer to mix this now if you've ever watched cooking with Emma where I basically cook pretty self-explanatory you would know I don't have a hand mixer meaning that I have to use all of my Cardiovascular system to mix things with my own bare hands like a fucking pioneer from a little bit hashtag trigger But I'm gonna make it happen I just that's all I have to do I have to make it happen this video is all I have left I have to upload this video Tomorrow, but I have to make this work. We have to make it work. Let's go make the frosting now I'm so sad. I am so sad. Do you wanna know this please babies you and me okay? You've had a bad day before to mrs.. Or mr. and did not assume your gender gingerbread icing vegan recipe a bitch doesn't have eggs at her house I Should piss so bad just found a vegan recipe that calls for corn syrup of course They don't fucking a corn syrup at my house. I'm not like disgusting actually wait. Maybe I do let me call my mom She's literally another advice don't open the door. Um do we have corn syrup corn syrup. Yeah, I know Bye What This recipe calls for nine tablespoons of chickpea brine the water drained from a can of chickpeas That is so gross, but that is my only option Okay, it looks like we're making a chickpea brine This is not a job like this literally says do you know if we're doing it? We're doing it these things should never be put together that should never happen You know it's so thick um as you can see this looks like a literal boogers mixed with like urine I don't know it says to whisk the chickpea stuff with an electric whisk But I don't have that so I'm just gonna go like this really fast until it gets frothy I have an H on my nose, and I can't eat it right now because I'm busy Okay, I'm done mixing it it actually turned pretty frothy as you can see it's pretty freakin frothy. Do you have vegetable glycerin? Ah? That's fine, I don't need that it's optional It looks like icing, but it's like not that thick and I'm confused because I feel like icing is supposed to be super thick Actually tastes good even though. It's made of garbanzo bean juice. Do you want at this point? I can give up to it? We're back with our dysfunctional Frosting hopefully it holds everything together. Okay. First is fill the pastry bag, but I don't think I'm ready for that Do you know it I guess I am ready now now we cut off the tip now This is when things are gonna get messy, okay I don't have scissors with me right now, so I'm just gonna chew off the tip first We take this whatever the that is and we draw a line around the end. Oh my god. It's literally so Oh Oh my god, I hate my life I can't believe this is happening to me huh I can't believe that this is happening to me, okay I'm just gonna keep going okay. I think what I'm gonna. Do is. I think I'm gonna need to improvise improvise Originally this was supposed to be something that stood up, but I'm starting to realize that that's not going to happen It's just gonna be a laying down turkey, okay it's not gonna be standing up because guess what guess what I couldn't make the frosting I Literally am I don't know I literally cannot do anything correctly I just wanted this to look kind of good, but it's just not and I'm so sad But it's okay a laying down turkey is the best kind of turkey or at least that's what everybody thinks on Thanksgiving dinner night see I've never even tried a Thanksgiving turkey. I don't eat turkey these I'm not a murderer no I'm just kidding. Oh my god this looks so bad. I'm so sad I wanted it to look good the icing is the issue here, okay? Well now that I'm not making it stand up. I can eat this part. Whatever this is oh? Oh oh My god. No. Okay. You don't wanna look at it look at it It's a disappointment. Okay, but on a few new I brought a knife I forgot scissors my main thing then I was gonna go get with scissors, and I forgot it I literally think today is the worst day of my life I Brought some pasta because I think pasta would add some texture I brought some sprinkles because these sprinkles are cold, but they're not as colorful So that sucks unless but not least I brought garbanzo beans because we already have garbanzo beans in the icing so might as well add some to the actual decor oh And I brought peanut butter because peanut butter makes me happy I'm just excited for Black Friday this year to be honest because I really love shopping And it's the only thing that doesn't make me want to die is that sad and depressing Yeah, sure It is but do you know what else is sad depressing the fact that all the icing is spilling out onto my desk and that's just gonna be a To clean up, but let's try to put a mouth on it Oh, I'm gonna turn the gummy bear and these gummy into a mouth. Oh my god. This one's perfect look at it Oh, I kind of nailed that I honestly would talk But I have nothing else to say like I feel like today is just kind of spoken for itself even though It's disappointing because it's not standing up. It doesn't look at that bad. Let's put some of these garbanzo beans on this this is gross I Like our bones of beans But not in this setting you know I'm somebody who whenever I used to do gingerbread house building with my family I always used to be very competitive You know I wanted mine to look the best And I'm really Disappointing myself right now the fact that this looks so bad and that's really embarrassing Because I used to be somebody who was very good at building gingerbread houses very meticulous You know it would look almost like a real freaking house It was something that I took pride in turkeys have feathers right and one of noodles look like feathers Though I'm just gonna line up some pasta on this dish even though this pasta is made out of garbanzo beans You know I'm just more disappointed that it didn't get the chance to stand out I think the whole point about gingerbread houses And the thing that makes it kind of a challenge is the fact that you know you have to try to make it stand up See this one it never even got to that point Trader Joe's if you're watching this Thanks for trying But next time don't you sabotage my life by having Giddens secret needed ingredients in there so far It's fun. I don't know where I'm gonna have this peanut butter, but well make it have some chest hair Okay, my holiday turkey is done I took the camera off the tripod just so that I could give you a detailed tour of my turkey first We have its glorious feet. Just covered in some sprinkles because I had nothing more creative to do with it Then we have these beautiful chickpeas that it is resting. It's very uncreated feet on moving up We have the body of the turkey here We have some chest hair peanut butter going on here some blue eyes and a nice big smile as you can see we have some amazing icing detail here Just lining the body of the beautiful turkey Then we have some noodles here that I think add a lot of Personality and texture to the Turkey's feathers and last, but not least we have some rainbow sprinkles lining the feather area here And that is about it for the turkeys, so I hope you enjoyed this video if you did you enjoyed it Please give it a thumbs up for the turkey down below um Okay, now that I've given you the tour let's try it all together I already know that I hate it, but let's just try it oh no. Oh, you know. It's the worst part these motherfuckers Oh, no, that is so fucking rigged those Yeah, those are fucked up bro. And now look at this mess. Oh Even the bar with peanut butter on it tastes bad And that says something because peanut butter literally solves all of my life problems And if it can't solve this one then this means that this needs to go you know like I need the best part about this Whole thing is that these fruit snacks.

I'm walking to a cafe called recreational coffee It's about a seven minute walk away from my hotel. I'm going to this coffee shop to edit for a little bit I think I'm gay and walking the wrong way though Or maybe I'm not I don't know if you're confused as to why I'm in Long Beach Go ahead and check out the vlog that I'm uploading today It'll already be up by the time you see this vlog But yeah Long Beach is kind of weird like this is my first time ever being here It's definitely a little bit different a lot of big buildings But there's not a lot of people around so it's kind of weird once I'm done editing and everything like that and I get the video uploaded then we can have a fun time in Long Beach together Also, let me insert my OOTD because they thought my outfit was kind of cute today and a little bit creative You know um just kidding Turtleneck is from brandy Shh the fuzzy little poopy sweater is from forever21 pants or Levi's my blue vans Good how are you? Just finished at the cafe it is now 1 to 15 about 1:15 now I'm hella hungry because all I had today was a vegan doughnut. Which was actually a big thumbs up for me It was definitely good never had a vegan doughnut before I don't think so it was really good. It was a chocolate sprinkle It was great. It was actually so fucking good I really like that cafe if you live in Long Beach Or your like you travel to Long Beach for some reason recreational coffee. I don't know what street It's on or anything, but it's a really good place So check it out So I need to get out of my room like right now because the cleaning people are about to clean my room So I have to do that my video is taking forever to upload like it's supposed to take another hour and 30 minutes So what I think I'm gonna. Do is. I'm gonna go get some lunch cuz I'm really fucking hungry I need to get out of my room, but I'm like comfortable, and I like don't want to leave I think what I'm gonna get for lunch is I'm gonna get in a Seibel or I you see them all the time But they are kind of like sugary. I mean not like in a bad way like it's all healthy sugar usually I don't usually eat them because they can kind of spike your blood sugar listen to me. I sound like a fucking grandma, but It's true. It's about a mile away, so I'm thinking I might want to drive there because I don't really want to drive anywhere right now
Let's see if there's anywhere near me that I can just walk to cuz I'm just like not in the mood to drive like ever Since I drove here watch the last vlog it all makes sense I'm burnt out on driving because like I had to drive all the way here six hours And I'm like burn out so like I don't ever want to have to drive again So I just like to walk everywhere right now Which is like so weird for me because I love driving like that's been my thing for the past like four and a half months Since I got my license like I've just been driving non-stop And that just pushed me over the edge like I am just not feeling it so okay There's a place called under the Sun for everybody who hates Yelp, cube Because I love Yelp and this is how I found all my cool restaurants, so it looks like this whole entire restaurant is vegan So that's cool. They have hummus there I Love hummus, okay. We're going here. Okay. We're going here I'm glad that I could get out of here before the cleaning people try to clean this room because I always get really stressed out That I'm gonna be in and they're gonna be like can you get out and I'm like oh fuck I'm kind of afraid of elevators here because earlier when I was coming up the elevator I was walking in and I saw a little bug on the ground and I looked closer And it was a cockroach and I'm not a big fan of cockroach as myself So I kind of freaked me out insert the clip here I'm just hoping I don't have another experience like that again. Hopefully. I'm going the right way To the side of kale chips Okay back in the room once again to upload my video It says it's gonna be about two hours and 30 minutes So that's absolutely Amazing so I have to just leave my laptop in here and wait for it to upload and while I'm waiting I think I'm gonna go do a little bit of Thrifting if you've been watching me for a while you know that I'm a thrifty god. No I'm totally just kidding, but I do go through 15 quite a lot I have four thrifting places that I want to go to that's gonna be exhausting and my back still hurts from the drive up here the drive up your Rectum my body wrecked my body it kind of feels weird to be back in the car for the first time since my long excursion Eight-minute drive not too shabby starting routes of assistance the thrift shop. Oh, yeah, I forgot how to drive proceed to the roof, okay I proceed to the roof. Okay, shut up this parking garage is just twisty as fuck I hear some snazzy jazz playing I wonder where it's coming from wherever it is. I want to be there Oh my God look how corny this it is safe travels. Not all who wander are lost I do. I give you this Oh Perfect. Thank you. Oh, I hear where the jazz is coming from that's pitiful normally I've listened to music but like driving around here gives me major anxiety vibes, so I'm just not going to do Yesterday, I went into this random 7-eleven because me and my mom needed to get some waters We were thirsty we went in there, and I swear to god. We almost got murdered multiple times I don't know why the vibes in there were just extremely not good anyway, so yeah We thought we were gonna get murdered it turns out we didn't there's only a 7-eleven I just don't like like I really do not like the vibe of a 7-eleven I can go anywhere and like be pretty comfortable, but something about 7-eleven just makes me feel very uneasy And I am NOT a fan if you like 7-eleven. I'm so sorry like I don't mean to offend you It's just I don't like it I heard that thrifting in this area is actually really good like people find really good around here So I'm really crossing my gosh darn fingers hoping that I can snatch up a few goodies. I sound like a grandma No, not even a grandma a teacher librarian. I don't know something like that my goodness. It is literally so warm out I'm so confused. It's like hot like I'm like sweating This is insane weather for November like I can't believe how warm it is Maybe it's global warming or maybe it's just Cal November. I don't know Oh My god, it's hot in here. I went to maybe six thirty sores or something like that I went to so many and it was Insane like there are so many thrift stores around here and all of them have good vintage it like actually good stuff They were definitely little bit overpriced Kinda that I felt like everything was like reasonable my thing was like too overpriced actually it was like reasonably overpriced So I'm gonna do a little haul so the first place. I went into what was called like I don't remember It is called, but I got a pair of jeans from there, so I spent 40 bucks on these jeans But they were pretty worth it in my opinion. They're just some black mom jeans or - jeans They're kind of like mom jeans they fit super well They're a little bit tight around the waist But I feel like it's the kind of thing where like I'm just really used to loose-fitting clothes but they're like not like jegging denim like they're real like tough denim if that makes sense like I'm used to all my jeans being like skin geng's I just I love jeggings so all my jeans are really soft and these are like hardcore denim But they look really dope and some super pumped about those next I went to this thrift store on Donates like all their profits to like an AIDS Foundation, which I thought was really dope so I was like - Noah I'm definitely gonna pick up something from here We're like donate or something cuz I like their I like their thing. I liked what they were doing in there first thing I got Was this cashmere extra-large cashmere sweater for three dollars Kashmir's fuckin expensive, so I was pretty excited about this I got this okay prepared to just like piss your pants. I got this big freakin Levi's lined denim jacket This was only 40 bucks I kid you not if you try to buy this online you would spend a Minimum of 200 dollars like these are so expensive and so fact I did find it for $40 and not only that I was like doing that for a good cause I was just in complete And utter awe that I found that so if you're in Long Beach And you want to go through everything I would definitely recommend Assistance league aid so I think it's called definitely check that out because you're freaking thrifting for a good cause that is the best thing I've ever heard in my life I can't even get over it And I'm so thankful that I found that I'm about to go back to my hotel room now and just chill for a little bit Because I've kind of been on the go I kind of want to change into some comfy clothes and just relax for a little bit And then maybe get some food because I'm hungry again, so I'm fine hungry. No. I got home from my thrifting extravaganza I Laid in my bed and got super tired for like three hours, and it's now 6:00, and we're gonna get some dinner We're gonna go get some Thai food I'm so excited you say really like Thai food, and I'm just excited because I'm hungry and I've been hungry for multiple hours But I've just been like too lazy Actually get up and get food, and I'm also excited because there's a 24-hour fitness center in this hotel so later We're gonna go get our sweat grind in and it's gonna be freakin lit It's gonna be freakin wild it's gonna be freakin crazy to dinner. I'm literally wearing sweats also after dinner We're gonna go to this place it has vegan cheesecake, so that will be super YUM. I love vegan cheesecake I've only had it like once before but when I had it. It was so good. Are you excited? yeah Thanks, ma'am. Okay. Hi everyone reporting to you live from the Thai restaurant I am extremely excited to tell you guys what I'm gonna be getting today so first We're gonna be getting some green curry. You don't like green curry. No eat. No. I'm not getting green curry. I'm getting yellow Curry, I don't know what I was thinking anyways. I personally think curry is an absolutely flavorful dish that I think is so tasty and fun somebody getting some of that then we're gonna move over here And I'm gonna be getting the golden tofu *CoUgH cOuGh* Can I can I do the seafood with no squid? I don't know if you can hear the music in here, but it's absolutely serene Like I'm an accommodation of like an EDM rave in like a $14,000 spa anyways getting a little ahead of myself here I'm so excited right now. I could pee my pants food is now complete. Oh food was really good I would definitely recommend. Thai food is a Absolute vibe, it's just a fuckin vibe. Okay, so what what now are we gonna go party. We're gonna go get raw vegan No, we're not because guess what we were gonna go get some vegan cheesecake But I'm so full that I literally can't walk oh.

✭ Jpn feat. Kanye West - you gotta be kidding me with this honestly",2017-11-17T00:25:44Z,185461,6741016,6403,"Good morning guys, it's about 6:15 in the morning right now. It's pretty freakin dark, so I'm sorry the lighting is ASS. So today I'm embarking on a freakin'  journey to say the least. Let me explain, so, basically my mom has some sort of business conference meeting or something in Long Beach, California Which is close to Los Angeles sort of so from like 8:00 to 5:00 every single day of this conference my mom's gonna be at some sort of conference and so she told me 'hey Emma if you want you can drive up to Long Beach on your own and you can meet up with me' so my mom is supposed to be there for like a week but, I didn't want to go out for a full week So I decided I would just drive down for about four days And just hang out there while my mom has her conference and then that means that I can just drive anywhere I want and just hang out in the area, and so I live in northern California, so this is in southern California so basically I'm road tripping to southern California all by myself Sixteen years old. I'm nervous a little bit. It's not that far of a drive. It's only like six hours Here's the plan Long Beach is actually farther away from my house than Santa Monica and like a few other places So I had the dope idea that I would stop in Santa Monica on my way to Long Beach Santa Monica is about five hours and 30 minutes away from my house, which really isn't that bad once I get to Santa Monica I'm gonna go to all those trendy places that you go to if you were there such as Earth Cafe Yeah, you heard that right the  promenade or something I'm gonna do all the basic shit that people do in Santa Monica also fun fact, okay I've been to LA like many times, but like I haven't really explored it very much on my own I usually had cheer competitions there, so I never really got to enjoy it, but yeah, so I'm excited because I'm excited because this is actually the first time I'll actually be kind of exploring it obviously I'm not gonna film myself the entire road trip I think everybody would rip their hair out including me So instead I decided that I would check in once per hour and give you a little update I'm hoping I don't hit any traffic. I don't think that I will considering it is 6:00 a.m. I didn't eat breakfast or anything, but I didn't really have any snacks at my house, so like when I get to Santa Monica I'm to be fuckin hungry as hell, so I'm going straight to earth cafe I'm super excited because of all the trendy people and all the trendy youtubers in LA go to earth It has been exactly sorry I look really weird right now, but its been exactly one hour since we last talked And I'm feeling really energized surprisingly. I literally went to bed at 2:00 a.m.. Woke up at 5:30 That's three and a half hours of sleep And I still don't feel that tired so far driving hasn't been too bad the views have been kinda pretty and nice But some Acura has been riding my ass, and I am going above the speed limit, but they still are riding my ass Which is so annoying? Do you know what? Fuck you Acura fuck you anyways I've been listening to my oldies playlist on Spotify It's a good time. I'll leave my Spotify in the description. because I am doing this road trip alone I was forced to sing the male and female part of don't go breakin my heart by Elton John I had a coffee it gave me some energy But it also made me really have to pee so I super duper have to pee but I'm just gonna hold it for as long as Absolutely possible and put off actually going to the bathroom because I just don't want to I drove through a bunch of like Farms like crop fields and stuff, and there's all these like fresh fruit stands and all of them were closed I was actually gonna like consider like going to one and like getting some fruit or whatever. It's like That's cute and goals you know using my resources and also I didn't bring any snacks So I was like you know that could be good, but um they're all closed and I was super sad. Right now as you can see I'm looking at some nice mountains and stuff I don't know if this is the most scenic route but it's so far pretty scenic and I'm digging that aspect because I like a nice scenic I was thinking that maybe I should like listen to a podcast or something like that But I don't have any like downloaded or anything So it would use it would use a shit tonne of data and like I don't have data to spare like I run out like anyways the first time I looked at the clock it was 6:31am I like jammed out to a song I was like I bet a bunch of time has passed like wow like you know I've been like listening to some music for a while now, and I look at the clock and it's 6:36 and I'm like it's been five minutes, and I felt like it had been at least 20 But every minute that goes by is just one more minute that I have to pee more And I'm honestly regretting not wearing a diaper Like I'm not kidding like I wish I could just pee my pants like not even saying that as a joke like I genuinely wish I could just pee my pants when I go on road trips my mom And I have to pee I always pee In a cup like I'll use like a Starbucks cup and I'll fucking pee in it while we're driving um I probably shouldn't have told you that and don't ask about the logistics In case you were wondering I did stop at a rest stop, and I went pee which was interesting and kind of scary I've never been to a rest stop before and it was a little bit sketchy, but it was fine. I'm about like 230 miles away, which it just seems so far, but I mean times passing pretty fast So what can you do but a few things I've noticed - number one. There's so many trucks everywhere I don't even know what they hold like what are they even doing, but there's a bunch of trucks and uh? They're really fucking slow So that's annoying also people get like so Annoying on this freakin highway like I'm literally going 10 miles per hour over the speed limit Which is like kind of wild for me, and everybody's like passing me, but if I go any faster I'll be going like a hundred miles per hour so like I'm not trying to literally die Sorry, and also I don't want to get a fucking speeding tickets. I'm not stupid. This truck is fucking on my ass I'm literally going 85 like and also there's two trucks in front of me like I can't go look There's literally two trucks in front of me. I can't go any faster. Stop looking riding my ass Sorry For the past like I don't know, maybe um I don't know like 45 minutes It's just smelled like cow shit and before that for like 45 minutes It smelled like garlic which garlic is not as bad as cow shit, but like it's still kind of gross They also just realized. I'm literally wearing a stroke shirt. I don't know who to tell and I'm listening to the strokes I've actually had this t-shirt since like eighth grade And I just now started wearing it my 16 year old self is giving my 13 year old self a high five for that move that's about it, it just smells like fucking cow shit. I'm not happy about it. I am feeling some are we there yet vibes. I mean, I'm kind of like zoning out a little bit So I don't freaking care And then I look at the clock and like thirty minutes have gone by and I'm like well swag I'm starting to have to pee like I feel like I have to pee again I don't want to stop again, so I'm probably going to hold it, but yeah, I'm bored and my back hurts this is just kind of crazy 🎵I miss the old Kanye 🎵 oh my god Okay, just went to the bathroom for the second time stopped at a nice gas station I was going to try to hold it for a long time But then I saw a sign that was like next gas station is in 30 miles, and I was like oh I should probably go I walk in there, and I'm like yo do you guys have a bathroom Or do I need a key or whatever and he was like no I was like Okay, and then I started walking out. He's like just JK, and I'm like okay. That was not funny I'm sensitive, but yeah, so he's being a jokester which was hilarious Joke of the year fucking comedy at its purest so I went to the bathroom And I walk in there and my immediate reaction is holy shit this bathroom is disgusting It was just super like worn worn down paint was chipping everywhere the locks were like broken on like each individual stall I was like shit. This is like not good so I walk into the stall and there's literally flies flying around in the bathroom . I'm not kidding. It was probably one of those disgusting things I've ever seen and I was so scarred for life like this stereotypical kind of idea of like a disgusting bathroom It has like flies flying around and I just thought oh That's kind of like a myth like I kind of thought about was just sort of like exaggeration or whatever But no like that happens, and I experienced it, and it was the scariest thing and mind you I peed in there, okay? I didn't leave and there were flies like landing on my fucking ass while I'm pissing It was horrible to make matters worse and also weirder when I got back in the car I realized they were like flies flying all around my car like swarming my car like at least like 50 of them So I literally drove away so fast and then they all got lost because now I'm on the freeway driving like 80 miles per hour so They're all gone now. That was kind of traumatizing I'm just excited to be there, but I'm also getting hungry, so I'm really excited to get food at Earth TRENDYYY Wow so another little while has passed and I'm like pretty close, so I'm like about 30 minutes away now And it would be like more like 15 minutes away, but we're in some bumper-to-bumper traffic well not really bumper-to-bumper but we're in some traffic I thought that I was gonna be able to like get here without any traffic at all that wasn't the case But that's okay I don't mind. I'm actually glad for some traffic because it's been some fast-paced shit for the past hour I just feel like it's been intense like people are just intense drivers around here. Everybody's kind of reckless I'm getting a really bad foot cramp from like you know frickin pedaling to the metal I've definitely got like four different anxiety attacks like four separate times This is like fuckin stressful as hell anyway driving in LA is definitely different than San Francisco, San Francisco is really bad, too But this is just like different I feel like I've been in the car for like my entire life like I feel like this is just What it's always been and this is how it always will be hopefully next time I talk to you I'm not in the car anymore *chill music* First time at earth cafe. It was definitely good food fresh nice tasty. Good times all around It's weird being in a new city like by yourself. It's super intimidating I'm really comfortable with vlogging like where I live because I don't know I'm just like used to it So it doesn't weird me out, but like vlogging in an unfamiliar place is scary, but it's good It's good experience for me You know like I've done a lot of independent stuff in my life But like this is probably one of the most independent things I've ever done, and I'm proud of me. Are you proud of me? I'm proud of me time to do a little bit of shopping, so we're going to 3rd Street, Promenade Promenade promenade promenade promenade. I don't know starting route to 3rd Street, Promenade Promenade I have a feeling that it's not pronounced promenade just a thought even though I had a coffee at Earth I'm definitely gonna be getting another coffee later because they have so many cute coffee places around here that I need to take advantage of my options but I don't know how to drive around here It's like little streets with so many different like lines on the ground like I don't know how that I don't know what any of these lines mean But yeah Santa Monica's really cute. I would not mind living here when I get older so maybe one day I'll move here even though I don't know if I could deal with this traffic because the traffic around here is ass I've been really paranoid about my car like literally throughout this like road trip experience I've just thought that my car's breaking down like 19 times, and it never broke down But I kept thinking that it was and it was freaking me the fuck out I've never seen more G wagons in like a span of 25 seconds in my entire life I've literally just all like 15 different G Wagons I feel hashtag poor with my Subaru don't back out you fucking stupid bitch Oh my god. Sorry. I saw a matte black G wagon Which I've only seen pictures of on Pinterest and stuff, and I just saw one in real life And I'm pretty sure only famous people have those so I don't know whose it was but it was definitely a celeb and that was my first celeb sighting of the day if I don't see like I don't know one of the Jenners or like I don't know if I don't see somebody really cool Who's famous I'm gonna be so pissed like what's the point of coming here? If I don't see someone who's famous do you know what I mean? even though I wouldn't even go up to them cuz I'm really a pussy But I would like look at them and like I can say that I've seen them before Okay, another g wagon if I see one more (siri: prepare to park your car.) Well. I can't Siri if I literally see one more g wagon I'm gonna cry I'm just gonna cry of happiness because this is where I belong Oh, there's parking. I think this one might be a winner. Yes, we found a spot baby. Oh my god. What a fucking rush. We're finally here. I have a parking spot *whispers* I love this song Okay, just finished at the promenade or promenade. I don't know okay. It was fun. I'm so wrecked though I'm so tired I need to get a coffee, so I just yelped per usual and found a coffee place called Alfred And I think it's like famous, but I'm not sure I'm just gonna go in there and chill out go on my computer It's about three o'clock and the traffic is so bad well here's the deal right now I'm in Santa Monica and my hotel room is in Long Beach because that's where my mom's work is at some point I need to somehow get there to Long Beach But I just don't want to drive there right now like I never want to drive again ever like I am so burnt out anyways have to get out of this parking garage somehow and then go to that coffee shop Which I actually need to map okay looks like it's about 20 minutes away. Oh fuck It looks like the coffee place Alfred that I want to go to is actually in the opposite direction That's backtracking I obviously don't want to do that so I need to find a new place really quick if you watch my vlog you know that I'm A huge fan of Phil's coffee, and they actually have a Phil's near here So I think I might just go to Phil's, but I really should explore new cafes fuck it I don't care I'm going to Phil I feel comfortable there. I feel at home there (siri:starting route to Phil's coffee). Oh my god ugh I just need to like sit in a cafe drink a coffee and just decompress is that even a word Decompress why do I feel like that's not a word. I don't know decompress yeah Oh my god, it's the next day. I stopped vlogging after Phil's because I assumed that what I was gonna do was I was going to vlog and like show the room and like get food once I got back to the room, but that didn't happen. Let me explain I finished at Phil's I got in the car And I was already kind of anxious like super anxious Like I don't know like just jazzed and I was like shaking that happens to me sometimes after I drink coffee so like I'm not too shocked so I start driving to Long Beach. It's about an hour-and-a-half drive. I was like fuck I don't want to do this right now I put on my music, and I'm just driving and it was confusing the directions It was just like I was turning left turning right turning left turning right like every five minutes And I was just like very anxious. at this point I'm not vlogging cause I'm like okay I'm really anxious I'm not gonna vlog right now. about 20 minutes go by of me Just like turning left turning right turn your left, and then I finally get on the freeway Which I felt better about because I'm like okay that means I'm like gonna get here faster or whatever But I was really anxious because I only had a quarter tank and I was like okay that will definitely last me But I'm not so sure you know I had to get to the hotel and at this point It was like 7:30 or something and so it was pitch black outside, which makes everything ten times worse But then the traffic got so thick that like I couldn't merge into like different lanes That was when things kind of got bad because I ended up missing one of my exits and at that point I'm just fucking crying because I'm like I want to go home. I just want to lay down in a fucking bed so tired I'm crying of course because I'm dramatic so imagine I don't even know where I was in order to get back on the freeway I had to drive through five miles of just back streets. It was bad, okay There were like people like strung out on drugs like running through the street like I am not exaggerating like just running back and forth in the street like fighting and like I was so scared that they were gonna try to like I don't know do something to me so after five miles of driving through that I finally get back on the freeway Yes And I Drive on the freeway for a little bit everything goes well and guess what guess who misses their exit again Me I start bawling again. I'm crying this time. I'm also in a sketchy area, so I'm like This is awesome, and I'm driving through this area, and it's just a bunch of strip clubs on both sides of me And I was just like what the fuck then I almost got hit by a truck while I was trying to go Okay, whatever, but that's not important. being in a new area when you're 16 is fucking scary and so I was just really feeling the heat towards the end like the last 15 minutes of my driving journey were the absolute worst. I was a mess okay. I was all over the fuckin place I was missing every turn every exit. I swear to God and it was just rerouting me rerouting me I want one I had to go over a bridge. I hate driving over bridges. It was so high off the water I don't know. I'm not afraid of heights, but like driving over Heights freaks me the fuck out You know it would say eight minutes, and then I'd miss a turn and it turn to ten minutes, and I was like oh I'm never going to get there, my gas light turns on basically saying that I'm like running out of gas I didn't know how many miles left I had in my tank to me I thought I had maybe three miles left in my tank My car doesn't tell me it just has like I don't know this sort of thing when the gas light turns on it says you need to fill up I didn't know if that meant I was completely empty I didn't know if that meant that I had like 20 miles left So I was freaking the fuck out and I kept passing these like gas stations And I'm like nope can't go in there. I would get killed at this point I gave no fucks, and I was just like driving like an idiot to be completely honest I wasn't like doing anything that was like dangerous like I wasn't doing anything that could even cause an accident But I was just doing things that were really not the best Okay Like having to switch into a lane really quickly and stuff like that which people obviously don't like but that was like what I had to do because siri would reroute me, and she would be like oh get in the left lane And I'd be like fuck you know what I mean there was one intersection I was sitting at and the guy was sitting right here And I was sitting like right back here like I didn't pull up all the way because I could have pulled up all the way But I was like back here because he was so mad at me for accidentally kind of cutting him off And he was like trying to scream at me through the car But I just like wouldn't pull up next to him because I knew that if I pulled up next to him you just fucking freak Me out on top of it I was already crying and I didn't want that bitch-ass to think that I was like crying because he scared me I didn't want him to have that satisfaction So I didn't want him to know I was crying Finally I pull up to in front of the hotel and My mom's standing out in front because apparently I think my dad texted my mom and was like okay You need to kinda like help her okay? She's a mess we went and got gas. We came back to the room I got room service I got a hummus platter. It was pretty good You know I'm a sucker for hummus a lot of people don't like it, but I think it's fuckin awesome And then I went to bed fast forward to this morning I set an alarm for nine o'clock, and I turned it off and then woke up at 1:00 p.m. I have never done that before I've never slept until 1:00 p.m. But I only slept for three hours yesterday, so it kind of makes sense, so that was about it for this trip It was insane I wouldn't say I necessarily did it the best way I could have you know I probably should've eaten probably shouldn't have had as many coffees Probably should have filled up my gas tank before I tried to go from Santa Monica to Long Beach But either way I made it. I survived before we end this video I'm gonna do a little haul I went to multiple stores But the only stores I actually bought things from where Urban Outfitters and Brandy are we surprised no first thing I got was from urban. I was so excited about these fitted Levi's 501s I'll make this a try on haul because I'm not selfish so those jeans are super fucking cute. They have a great fit I've been looking for Levi's that fit for so long and I've been trying to wear jeans more because I feel like when I wear Jeans,I look more put together next I went to Brandy first thing I got were these sweats that have like red stripes down the leg now my idea with these is that I could potentially Wear them in public as pants instead of sweats And I've been trying to find Sweats that I could like do that with because I'm so lazy next I got a shirt I have another one of these shirts, and I love it so much that I wanted to buy another one It's like this little lumberjack shirt short sleeve cropped super cute last thing I got was Navy corduroy kind of looking thing jacket, and it's super cozy soft warm Etc and I'm a huge fan. So that was it for my haul, No well That was it for my haul, but that's all I have for you guys today I hope you at least had a little bit of fun if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down Below anything you want I love you all appreciate you all and I'll see you next time"

It's a cute shirt trust me it's just it's this angle that's bad for it and, I'm not gonna go change so... Wearing a different shirt now I'm not, gonna lie to you guys i searched the web for hours yesterday trying to find a fun thanksgiving recipe because as we all know thanksgiving is in a few days, weeks. I don't know I'm no Thanksgiving specialist but, it's coming up and I wanted to make a thanksgiving recipe for the fam for the squad cooking with Emma, squad. But no. I could not find anything that inspired me. Instead we're making funfetti cake. Welcome back to another installment of cooking with, Emma. I know, we all love it. Well, especially me. I think I'm the one who loves it the most. It's fun. Actually, do you know what? Hold on a sec. Oh this? I am taking cooking with, Emma to a, whole new, level this season. no. This episode. Usually I have to like get my hands all dirty and then i try to touch my phone to like See the recipe and then I like scroll in my photo album to like find the recipe that i screenshot it and it takes forever but now I got it right here so this already is going off to a fucking swagging start. This recipe is gluten-free, vegan... anyone can eat it basically unless you're, like, allergic to sprinkles I don't know. Preheat the oven to 350. This is old hat for me ok I've been doing this for months. I'm feeling like this might be the episode where I don't have an epic fail. Don't wanna jinx it though. Ow. Is this even oven safe? Made in USA. Oven wear...Oven wear. This can work in the oven. Or so I think. Oil that shit up baby. Oil it up! I'm gonna use coconut oil today to grease this shit  because I don't know about you but I am a health guru. ooooooooo! woooooo! Sorry I kinda got carried away there. Okay also this camera angle is ass. My camera setup for cooking with Emma is different angle every single time It's just different, okay, so it's hard for me to set this up. The large mixing, bowl, combine all dry ingredients. Ew. I'm never doing that again. Big bowl. How big though? By large, bowl, do you mean like this or do you, mean like this? I don't know if you guys bake a lot like I do... if you start like mixing all your ingredients in a small ass bowl, that is just a recipe for disaster. You will have flour and shit all over your kitchen because it's just--you can't! So the bigger, bowl is better. Even though this is impossible to wash. I am not hashtag privileged. A hashtag kardashian and I don't have a dishwasher so I have to hand wash this shit. And it's huge! First ingredient... oh, shit. The first ingredient is already complicated because this recipe is gluten free, we basically are using oats as flour. But obviously oats, as you can see here, are big! So I have to grind them up myself. Ugh! I feel like I'm literally in the 1300s grinding with a fucking windmill or some shit. So we have to use our blender today I'm just gonna use one of these little pussy blender cups, because like, that's just the best option. That was one of the worst things that ever happened to me odhh i didn't say, what i'm making, okay? I don't even think i said what i was making i'm making fun fetty, cake That's a mess i love funfetti i think funfetti is one of the best kinds of cake in my opinion, do you Want this this is gonna be too small this is gonna be way too small, we need the food processor? Where is it i don't know i have no clue, where is it i'm at? A loss for words i don't know, where it is oh here it is yes? See, that's much better i'm kind of hopeful for this episode i think it might be good for me i think it might be really Good for me now it's time for emma to attempt to use this i have no clue, how To, use it okay so far so good power on? Maybe this isn't gonna, be so bad after all i've never made my, own flower before i feel like a pilgrim Speaking of pilgrims it's almost thanksgiving i personally am not the biggest fan of thanksgiving it's just not my fav Okay, thanksgiving for me i like it but, because i'm a vegetarian i don't have That many food options that i can eat so like it's not as fun for me as it is for everyone else on the other Hand i do celebrate black friday? Often pre-heated when you learn, about the history of thanksgiving it's kind of depressing but, we all talk, about that so this is our sweetener? It smells so odd it always smells weird oh my god i never bought, my measuring cups out sorry, yeah, oh, also if you, want to know something fun i One tablespoon of baking powder that's a lot of fucking baking powder that's so much I don't know How to feel, about that hopefully i don't get poisoned i don't know. Anyway, okay, now, we mix this You know most people have a whisk at their house it does the job and it does it just fine but My, house, my house is a little bit different because in this house, we raise baking gurus in this house, we have mini whisks If you, have seen, some cooking with, us with, me of course you're, familiar with, the mini whisk, but if you have not then please, meet my little friend this is my mini whisk he's honestly the star of this show Moral for is mini whisks are better than regular whisks and i don't need to discriminate looks like something gordon ramsay Would probably shit out of his, ass one cup of freaking, milk jesus christ Well i'm using almond milk today because guess, what, this recipe is vegan so oh This, recipe called for a flax, egg, which is basically like When you mix flax seeds with water and it forms like a gel and it's supposed to be like in a kind of well see I didn't want to do that because that seemed like a lot of work So i'm actually going to be using 1/4 cup of applesauce instead because i googled it and it said that applesauce can Replace eggs in any recipe that might be where i fuck upl this could be the end at the same time i was not trying to Make a flax, egg, so like it was just this is just how. It had to be vanilla extract Let's see if we fucking spill this  today Fuck I already, spilled it i uh i always spill the vanilla *gasp* again? are you kidding? I totally jinxed it Last ingredient, well not quite nut butter in the recipe it says you can, choose any nut butter You, want but it says, we recommend? cashew Butter which is weird but it's even better because that means all of you guys with peanut allergies or? Even almond allergies you guys are safe to eat this recipe you are welcome a hashtag versatility, okay? You're, welcome anyways cashew, butter i don't know how i feel about it on its, own but in recipes i've actually Had it in recipes and it is phenom You know so it says 1/2 cup of melted I have a bunch in front of my microwave right now let's move it out of the way That's up to pee so bad if you pee so bad but like i'm not gonna go because, oh? I'm busy right now. Cashew, butter, is sticky as fuck that's probably, why, we're supposed to microwave it, oh? sorry, neighbors and Okay, we're gonna warm this up for 30-second intervals it doesn't tell me how Many sprinkles to add it just says, add sprinkles so like this is gonna be fuckin wild can i also tell a story About them i bought these sprinkles this one too getting these sprinkles, was not easy, may i also mention getting this Cashew, butter, was not easy i had to go to two stores to get this cashew Butter i had to go to three stores to get the sprinkles wow Okay, i kind of explained that badly, okay, so first i start out By, going to trader joe's they, did not have sprinkles or cashew, butter then, i went to whole foods They, had cashew, butter, which i then purchased, but they, did not have sprinkles at all then i went cvs And i was like they must have sprinkles no it was walgreens, fuck you Walgreens They had literally every kind of baking thing that you would ever need, along with 15 different flavors of jell-o but they did not have any sprinkles so then last but not least i go to safeway, shout out to you safeway, i found exactly the sprinkles that I needed did I just burn this? Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew, maybe I did just burn this i don't know Okay, now it looks like it's time to actually, add the sprinkles i'm adding a bunch, okay i'm sorry They're all sinking to the bottom look, they all sunk to the bottom i can't even see it okay that That was a sound i'm sad to say it but the mini whisk has to go into retirement for now Because this is a big, bowl and it requires the big guns i don't know About you but i like a Ton of in funfetti i don't like it to be just like every once in a while you get a little color spec i like There to be fucking color specs muffin, everywhere, okay, this matter smells so, weird so we're two balls deep in it now you, that's a gross Okay, anyway i'm to add more sprinkles fish i knew that this was gonna happen i was gonna go overboard i'm gonna go overboard that's So much better Okay, i think we're. Like almost done which is like really weird if you like, these videos always go by so quick Because like i'm just like a really efficient, baker i'm just really efficient in the kitchen There's one of those pour batter into greased baking dish and top with extra sprinkles Right balls i mean, okay so this is my, baking dish It kind of looks nasty it literally kind of looks like, ass no no not like Ass it looks like actually poop feces have you heard of her, oh, oh? oh Okay, i ate too much okay She's so cute, okay, she's going in the oven now 25 minutes baby Normally i'd be really upset that i'd have to wait 25 minutes for this to be done but in the meantime i have another assignment I have to make the glaze because obviously this is cake, not so it needs to have like Some sort of frosting classic glaze on the top obviously Okay, two tablespoons of coconut, butter You, don't know, what coconut butter is i don't either so that's fine where's my tablespoon i'm freaking out, oh? oh i grew in the same shit this is so hard that's what she said coconut butter is so hard i Can't even get it out. Okay, that's like i'm gonna work out for the rest of the year 15 seconds on the clock Next step it's adds two scoops of protein powder to the coconut butter so i have all of these i don't know Which one to use i'm super ripped if you can't see so, my, like, main food group is protein powder so i have a lot, laying around, and Where's, my, fucking mini whisk She i have to piss i have to piss i've had to pee this entire filming process Half the reason, why i talk so fast because they, always have to pee this, makes me nervous Because protein powder to me actually, like realtalk protein powder is kind of doesn't taste good i mean i love the effects? Because it makes me fucking ripped Oh it has like nice little vanilla beans in it that's so cute it has like little vanilla beans in it that's an artsy bro Okay, i mean it's not the worst thing i've had i mean it's up there but it's not that bad i can definitely consume this On top of cake especially yeah count, me in so i should probably clean up my station this is my Melis hair part about fucking with, emma, is it i'd actually clean up after myself which is appalling? Why'd i do that, why, did that why, did i do that i really? Don't want to clean this up i do not, want to clean this up right now i do not Want to clean it up i don't ever want to clean up ever if it was up to me i don't know i just would Never clean up again It's ready let's see how it looks look at her she looks kind of good i think i can't really no Oh, i think she's done Okay, so this is i have to let, it sit for another five minutes which, is kind of a long time and i'm a Little bit pissed, because like i was ready to eat but all good things come with time All right it looks like i'll see you little sweetie babe It's time to, assemble the pie i mean cake, what the fuck we're. Just gonna, add that glaze straight on over? Look at that We are so cute together she didn't really hold, together too, well but she Also, is kind of brown, which i guess is what you would expect, if he trying to make healthy, cake But it's all about the flavor let's just have a nice bite She's not great you know, she sucks i'm mad don't make this at home i tried, okay? I, did she said it didn't work out, oh? But i hope you have fun with me anyways if you Did give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below Anything you want i love you all so much appreciate every single last one of you and i can't, wait to see you next time you"

Check out his channel!! - https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-11-12T22:18:57Z,183058,5898919,10683,"If you're gonna come up onto this video right now and Comment something snarky like ""this video is just an excuse for Emma to eat food like what the fuck, bro"" You'd actually be correct so feel free to comment that if you want What's up guys? It's Emma, today I'm back with a video I'm so fricking pumped because I'm about to eat some food but it might not be so great because Here's the thing I had this idea that I would go to the grocery store and buy all of the foods that I used to Eat when I was younger like anywhere from like five to like twelve, during that age group time of my life I ate so bad, so bad like I was I'm actually surprised I don't have like diseases because I ate so bad Extremely unhealthy I never ate vegetables or anything I ate so bad Which is fine because when you're like seven like you have the fastest metabolism of all time And it just like doesn't matter um. Yeah, well those days are over, but it was fun while it lasted anyways I haven't eaten these foods in like ten years This video is going to be taking a lot of effort from my side over here because some of this stuff I actually have to cook in the microwave Unbelievable, it's a lot of work, okay. First, We'll start out with a few snacks This first snack was my favorite snack you might have never even had these before because they're really random It's called sabritones, sabriTINOZ SabritONS Sabritina I actually used to call them Sabritino's when I was little Sabritino's S-A-B-R-I-T-O-N-E-S which like if you Sound that out sabritinos yeah LETS TRY IT OUTTT! I'm so excited these were so good I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed. my memory of these was like them being my favorite food I remember these being the one thing I'd look forward to at recess everyday, and they're not living up to that expectation right now They're honestly like not that good! like they don't have that much flavor. They're not bad They're just boring I'd rather have a Dorito. You know what I mean. I'm not mad, because the memories that those gave me were absolutely Irreplaceable during recess I remember my friends would ask me for one and I would decline every day It was that one snack that you would just not share. kind of an emotional start But what can you do next snack I actually had to cook and to pour water in it and then put it in the microwave and then pour cheese packet in it It was not all fun and games it was hard. I'm just kidding, but my next snack Is this Annie's white cheddar mac and cheese I used to eat this for dinner like five times a week um Ever since this mac and cheese came into my life I have been a strong believer that white cheddar mac and cheese is superior I don't know. Maybe it's just me, but this was my shit. I'm gonna take a huge bite No, I'm not so what if I hate it? Mmm? I don't think you can hate mac and cheese Oh f*ck this it's exactly what I remember this makes up for the fact that that was not that good okay I need to stop cuz I have like a bunch of other foods to eat but Okay, so this is one things kind of start getting a little bit interesting because see I grew up as a vegetarian meaning I never ate meat so I haven't tried most of the meats that you probably eat on a daily basis such ads like steak, chicken, hamburger like it just never landed in my mouth So I gotta grow up like you know eating things that were like an imitation that would like make up for my lack of meat one of the things that my parents would feed me as a young way as a Youngin to help me feel like I really fit in was these morning star farms original sausage sausage Patties okay, I've never tried real sausage, so I don't know how accurate this is but I have one right here Um as you can see it looks like a nice hockey puck dog sh*t hybrid it doesn't look the best, okay? I've seen more attractive things than this maybe it'll taste really good I don't really remember exactly what these taste like because I literally haven't had them for years I don't know what it's even made out of because it's not meat, but what else could it be beats me. Let's try it I'd give the temperature of four out of ten the spice is in it not too shabby, but the texture is not the best It's super dry I feel like I need like ten bottles of water to get that fully down my throat But it's not bad definitely gives me some Elementary school morning time feels I think that if I didn't eat these as a kids I wouldn't be able to eat it cuz it's kind of weird, but because I have so much experience with these bad boys It's kind of just more like memories Will move on from the hockey pucks for now okay next let's get into something that literally it makes me feel something We have pop-tarts right okay? These are the s'mores flavor which is an important factor but let me just explain so when I was little I used to play toontown that was my sh*t It was actually worrisome to my family. How good I was at it, and it was my main passion in life I had dreams about it, but you know during the week I would get home from school And I'd only be able to play for like an hour so because I'd have homework the weekdays I was kind of torn apart from my love, which was toontown, but then on the weekends That's when I really want hand. I just remember you know Sunday's me sitting playing toon town just defeating those cogs like a savage and Eating s'mores pop-tarts, so I have very high expectations right now if I don't literally taste toontown I'm gonna be disappointed as I miss toontown more than literally anything in my life But they shut it down and now there's like weird like illegal fake versions of it But like it's just not the same whatever if you never played toontown This is gonna be over your head, but oh my god if toontown had a flavor It would be these pop-tarts this should be illegal. I'm like emotional because I literally I must put it away They're so good number one start. You know what?  Not only are they just so fucking good, but they taste like toontown I feel empty inside the fact that I can taste toontown But I'm not playing it and it's really upsetting so we need to move on before I start I don't know crying you my last hot food item Yaki, soba, you know most of you basically just for all I used to have cup of noodles And do you know why I had my fair share too But this this was my jam I used to get the flavor teriyaki chicken Which doesn't actually have chicken in it has chicken flavoring, so it's technically vegetarian, which I think is fucking weird But whatever basically I remember one time I was at my friend's house my best friend at the time in elementary school and her mom Cooked some of this up for dinner, and I had a little nibble of it, and I became addicted I went home and I told my mom I'm like mom you need to buy this for me right now went to the store bought Some of this. I don't know something about the flavor. It's probably the MSG in it they made me addicted to it You know I don't know it doesn't look gross, but something about like this black plastic just Really turns me off, but I know it's gonna taste good already because there's no way I was that obsessed with it as a child I Am struck again with disappointment don't get me wrong. It's good. But the flavors are just bland. It's just kind of boring I'm not excited by it I'm not feeling things like it doesn't make me feel something which is what I look for in these nostalgic foods The noodles kind of feel like I don't know spaghetti squash, but like in the worst way possible They're kind of soggy and like all one Texture, but at the same time. I can't stop eating it I'm pretty sure that's the msg at work, so let's stop while we're ahead I want me to throw this away because it is quite addicting. There's something very addicting about it. I must stop Let's do one of my favorite snacks that I seee you know during recess as well And I originally wasn't gonna read like feature this in a video But I realize this lemon zest Luna bar has made me the woman that I am today if you're unaware Luna bars are for women only meaning that if you're a man And you eat this you have a 50% chance of growing titties I don't know if that's true on the back very small in very small letters. It says whole nutrition bar for women which is Weird this bar really helped me grow into a woman obviously it didn't do that well of a job considering people still mistake me for a twelve-year-old boy But Luna bars are like so bad for you the nutritional value in this is about equivalent to a Snickers bar, but oh I feel myself becoming a woman right now amazing I mean it tastes fucking good But it's just not good for you next lunch snack. I used to eat these Yan Yans double cream strawberry and chocolate cream Oh wild okay basically how it worked is you have a stick and then you have two little Icing things and you just dip it. And then just eat it. Oh wow. Oh my god this icing mmm. It's so soft Wait this is actually really f*cking good the icing is like so light and fluffy I am by no means mad at this, but I am a little bit mad because here is the dirty secret Yan Yan You're hiding something from us all and here's what it is Okay beware for all your dreams to be crushed because I know mine were when I found this out as you can see you have you know this nice section here for the sticks and then of Course you have your icing right here right now because this is such a long Container you would assume that the icing would go all the way down right no It doesn't the icing only goes to about here And you can kind of see through this thing as a child finding this out was absolutely heartbreaking It was kind of a sneak peek to what was gonna happen later when I found out about the Tooth Fairy But I think this was almost worse I've literally didn't two of these and I'm like already out icing that's just I don't really mean I'm not gonna blame Yan Yan, and it isn't their fault. No do you not get it is their fault This is turning into my leg little like jump trot pot. This is turning into my junk pile, and it's kind of gross but I'm also really Sweating right now because I tried to wear a sweater to be spirited because it is fall now if you didn't already know I'm sweating because it's really hot in California and like I'm sweating mmm. Okay, sue me I'm starting to feel a little bit sick I'm not gonna lie next snack Lunchables now see as you know I grew up as a vegetarian meaning that the Original Pam cheese and like little Ritz cracker knockoff sort of thing the og lunchable wasn't something that I could eat and I also didn't like the pizza one because for some reason the cold pizza like upset me so my Lunchable of choice was the chips and salsa one But another funny thing about me was that I really didn't like nacho cheese Until I was a little bit older than I started liking it But at the time that I was eating Lunchables I for sure did not like it I would get this right and I would just eat the chips with the salsa And I'd ignore the cheese the funny part about that Is there's actually more cheese than there is salsa which is rude. Holy sh*t this is good salsa Yeah, that's like good salsa. Yeah. I can't just do all this and not try some of the nacho You know what I mean like you know. I don't like it. I already hate it, okay Do you know what that's just like not bad at all I don't know why I was afraid of it as a child I was Like I was afraid of it like I wouldn't eat it because it scared me, but it just tastes like nacho cheese I don't know what my issue was. Ew okay wait the aftertaste is really um Disturbing so we're gonna cut ourselves off here I
Feel so nauseous right now like all this fucking shitty ass food is making me feel like I'm dying like I feel like I'm dying I think the nacho cheese kind of pushed me over the edge, but for a nice little palate cleanser Let's have my middle tool. So this is actually a little bit older my favorite middle-school candy This is where my love for coffee bloomed coffee Rios, okay? I have this friend in middle school who I sat near in English I'm pretty sure she always had dope snacks and she would like share that like she was pretty open about it You know one day she comes English class. I think with some of these I pull up one of these in my mouth, and my life was changed forever These are like coffee flavored candies or whatever. This is the caramel ones to be exact Oh my god, Oh Bro these have like such a rich good coffee flavor. Ha the day after this girl Let me have one of these in class I went to a candy store near where I live and bought like five hundred of these in ate them in two days ow mm That's bad for my teeth. We're down to our last two snacks this also includes nacho cheese Which like surprises me because I I know that I used to eat these but why was I afraid of the nacho cheese and the lunchable and not of this I don't know I was going to buy the Crackers that come with this gross cheese and like the little red stick I'll insert a photo so you know what I'm talking about I was gonna buy that but it was like five dollars for a pack and this one was only two dollars for a pack of Them and you know what we're on a budget here So okay these breadsticks look like I don't know but like not did this was a snack that I would eat in like fourth grade so I was a little bit older But still it's not it's not something I respect you know I have like this time of my life when I was just really into snacks and like this was just one Of those like I also eat those like 100 calorie packs. Anyways. Let's see how it is okay that actually is kind good Okay, this cheese is much better than that cheese. I must say what I eat it again. No there are so many things I'd rather eat, but you know what not that bad my last food I started to say this one for last because the way that I eat it. Do you not hold on let's just it Let's backtrack okay You know what hold on a second, okay? Sorry so last night, we're gonna be talking about his Ritz now You might feel like Emma like everyone eats Ritz still like that's not weird the way that I used to eat Ritz was not only Disturbing, but also should be illegal and probably is in some countries if you're wondering Emma. Wow you're a cheap-ass bitch Why did you buy the weird off-brand because okay? I was trying to save $3 at the Lucky's this afternoon please try not to get nightmares from this I I know that you're probably gonna think of me differently after seeing that that's the way that I would consume Ritz crackers on a daily basis But there is something kind of fun about it. Anyway is well leaving you with that I need to go to the gym drink like 20 smoothies and green juices and Drink a shit ton of coffee or something just to cleanse my body because this makes me feel ill anyway I don't really know what you got out of this I don't even know really when I got out of this except for a headache, but hey I hope you had fun with me today if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you I love you all appreciate you all and I can't wait to see you next time"
bBAM97T4-i4,you are probably pronouncing this word wrong,“poke-eyy”,2017-11-09T22:35:54Z,141659,4038379,5972,"And that was my morning routine. Okay, what's up? Guys starting out my morning with a nice slap a chapstick literally half my comments on my last video was like oh my god Emma put on her chapstick like 900 times and I know I have this like weird habit where when I'm in the car I am constantly putting on chapstick I literally have to one of them doesn't even have a top anymore because I lost it That's gross, and it's getting germs all over It as we speak, but you know we do what we can.If you're wondering what chapstick it is It's the yes to coconuts from Target naturally smooth lip balm My lips get dry really easily, and I like to keep them... soggy. To start off this morning I have to go to the post office and drop off my D-Pop orders because I made a d- pop. If you want to check it out, go ahead. I'll leave a link in my description but my username is EmmaChambie, if you're interested. I'm just selling some of my old clothes on there, so yeah, we're gonna go into the post office I literally do not like the post office something about it makes me super uncomfortable But you know we're gonna push our fears aside today, and do what we have to do Okay that was pretty, uh, short-lived and easy. Literally took me one minute at most. Now it's time to go to Phil's, edit, do some work. You know I'm a... a hard working teen. Do all this stuff I have to do, and then... I dunno. Okay, so I have like, two Phil's locations that I go to, Phil's is the coffee shop I usually edit at. The Wi-Fi is fast, the coffee's good, and the vibes are good. There's one location that's like really close to my house, and there's one location that's like 20 minutes away. And I usually go to the location that's like 20 minutes away because, I don't know I like the vibe there better and also because it's bigger and like, I don't know I just like it better, but I'm not really in the mood to drive 20 minutes, so I'm gonna go to the one that's closer to my house. Is this significant to you? Not at all. But it is to me so, heh. Okay, it's you, please f-fuck you. Oh my god. I hate driving I actually love driving, but the people on the road piss me the fuck off and that's just what it is. Okay, last time I vlogged I was talking about how I was watching Riverdale and you know what? Riverdale, finished that shit, well I finished season one, and it was so goOOD. Like I'm not trying to be basic or whatever, but like it excites me. I love that show. Jughead, or Cole Sprouse, again I've said it once and I will continue to say it again! That man is something else, okay? That's all I have to say. Anyways, so now I'm watching Stranger Things. And if you don't watch any of these shows I'm so sorry, so I'll keep it really short. Stranger Things 2 so far is actually really good. I wasn't, like, sure if I was gonna like season two as much as season one because season one is always the best season two always kind of starts downgrading.  But so far it's been pretty good. Okay sorry I'm gonna stop talking about TV because that's just stupid ain't normally I'm not a TV person but like all these Netflix serieses really got me feeling some type of way you know and I've been really checking that shit out and Enjoying it. Oh my god. This mom is staring at me. I hate moms. Okay. No That's not sure. I love my own mom but other moms. They love to like bully. Oh my god Can I please tell you a story, okay? Sorry? I know you probably don't care, but like let me tell you so last night This kind of connects to the reason why I don't like moms, okay? or other moms let me explain so I was at the gym yesterday getting my grind in and I was using a leg machine and of course in between like sets I take a little break and go on my phone like I'm not gonna like do like Or sets like all in a row like you know you take little breaks in between sets so I'm just sitting there not using the machine, but like sitting there in between sets like a normal human being and This bitch actually Jim. I'll call her something else I feel bad this nice woman. Sorry That's better comes up to me and says are you done I look over at her and I was like not yet and afterwards she Got so fucking mad. Oh my god. She was so mad She like started talking to like the staff there And then I saw like her in the staff like eyeing me like giving me the side. Eye. I'm like okay Why are you guys acting like you are literal teenagers? I'm taking a 15 second break on this machine It's literally like 10 o'clock at night And there's like every other machine is open and you're gonna like what need to use the one that I'm you know it's an unspoken Rule that if somebody's using the machine you just kind of like let them finish And then you go on that really Got under my skin though like I literally was like mad about it for the next like hour and a half But moral the story is like parents and like moms especially Think that like they can just bully other people's kids in my opinion And this is just my opinion of course respect adults respect everyone though like respect adults But then also like respect kids cuz like kids are human beings, too Just a thought I don't know when I become a mom I will not try to discipline kids who aren't my own because that's just fucking annoying I I feel like I needed to get that off my chest And I'm really glad that I did so I kind of want to like get lunch somewhere so maybe I'll get okay Or whatever or pokey? Okay, I called it pokey once and I literally got roasted to no end when I go to get poked a I don't even actually Get poked a am. I gonna hit if I say that word one more time. I'm gonna lose it. I'm annoyed with it I'm annoyed with that word, but when I go there I actually Don't get the original kind of like Bowl I actually get a hand roll that has tofu avocado and and like tofu what you don't already say that Cucumber that's what it is and it's really good, maybe I'll get that later And you know what maybe I'll bring some home to my mom, too And just really kind of help out the community. You know just really help everyone out this afternoon. I'm feeling generous and nice It's a grind, but you know what I can't even start grinding until I find a fucking parking spot. Okay, it's important It's crucial, and it's not easy. Oh. Yeah the forum impeccable impeccable form oh yeah, baby Everybody on the streets looking at my ass parallel parking like a savage. Oh my god That's the bet that's the best I've ever done that is the best I've ever done I just got a spot right in front of Phil's like directly in front like like that's Phil's right there. Oh My god, I look like um I don't know just bad so just finished in Phil's I was in there for probably three and a half hours But I'm really hungry, so I texted my mom and I'm like hey do you want some? Okay, and she said yes, and so I was like all right, so I'm gonna get both of us some But I'm gonna try to repart closer to there because I've already been in this spot for three and a half hours And you're only allowed to be in the spot for two so like that's not good And I'm not trying to get another parking ticket because I have gotten a parking ticket here before and it was tragic It was my first and only parking ticket that I've ever gotten in I was sad Hi, my name is Emma, and there's no parking I should have just stayed in the spot that I was in before, but I had already overstepped my boundaries there So I couldn't do that and now I can't find a new spot, so I'm hashtag screwed That's bad because I'm really hungry, and it's starting to turn into a hangar I'm hangry Minnie the fucking get together and figure this out ASAP, or else. I'm gonna be hashtag screwed. Sorry I don't mean to keep hash tagging It's just I'm really good at it So it's hard for me to stop a day does not go by where I don't struggle to find parking It's just I don't know it's just one of my character traits I'm in the parking garage, which I do not prefer, but you know what I want my PO K I want to call it. PO pee so bad I just want to call it pokey, but I don't want to get roasted so gonna go get the PO K I'm gonna go get the food you know I'm just gonna call food for now cuz I feel like no one's gonna Rose me if I call it food And I also feel like order my mom's specific order hopefully I don't mess it up because I get nervous when people like tell me like what their order is because I always get scared if I mess it up like what if I accidentally forget like the one thing that's like their favorite thing Let's say like you know my mom's favorite ingredient is like extra sesame seeds And I forget to ask for that like she's gonna be so disappointed and like I don't want to disappoint her So I'm gonna really focus and I think that I can do this. Please wish me luck. I'll see you after I've gotten it I'm back. My mom's pokeball thing okay Excuse my French my hand rolls here Maybe we can do a little Mukbang or something it remember when that was the thing when like everybody would like eat and like talk But I don't like that personally, but maybe we can like try it out. Maybe it'll be fun Maybe I'll end up loving it. Maybe I'll end up being a mukbang youtuber Where all I do is eat food and like talk to the camera while I do it that could be actually really fun Where's my keys okay? I wish I was kidding But I literally Strapped my food in with a seatbelt because I don't know what to do like it can't go flying everywhere like this is like Transporting very like fragile material here and like there's nowhere else in my car that I can put it so I decided I just you know strap it in like a little child if it spills everywhere. I'm gonna be so sad Um just for anybody who's concerned. I just got home and Excited to report that the food has made it safe. I am so excited to eat It did not spill at all I am absolutely thrilled that this method worked out you heard it here first, and you'll hear it here last bitch Can you tell how excited I am that? I may eat right now. I am pumped the fij is out like I am so excited As I told you earlier I get the veggie hand roll so basically how it works is let me show you okay? They like give you that like roll thing here But then they give you like nori sheets separately like look at this, and then you roll it yourself How fun is that they do that with to go orders so that like the seaweed nori sheet doesn't get soggy? I guess I don't know I kind of think that the cute gesture that they like really look out for you making sure that the Nori doesn't get soggy. I think if that's cute I know you're supposed to like talk during mukbangs, but like I just don't want him so What do what we can do I'm gonna open some mail do a little bit of mail time cuz I went to my peel box Yesterday before I show you the stuff that I got recently I got this like really like random package filled with like a bunch of like little goodies in it and I never ended up showing it in a video because like I Opened it just like one random day But I wanted to show you some of my favorite highlights from that package Red Solo Cup laser or flashlight Which I think is dope and super cute so I'm gonna add these to my keys even though you know I'm not a huge partier, but I still thought it was funny next we have this little emoji guy I don't why he's just so funny to me I think this is like my alter ego Last thing from that package is this little like army guy and the reason why I love this is because one of my favorite scenes In Napoleon Dynamite features like this exact thing so when I saw this it like reminded me of Napoleon Dynamite And that is my favorite movie of all time So that just holds a special place in my heart because it reminds me Napoleon Dynamite, so that's pretty wet another thing I was sent a little while back, I put it on my snapchat story But I never put it in a video this iced almond milk latte, a frickin' painting, and how dope is that look? How good it is I think she did it with watercolors? It looks like and I am in love with this I want to hang it up somewhere. I'm excited about this I thought it was so cute and well done last things gonna be opening today are two letters I'm gonna eat while I'm reading it Thank You Kailyn. I think that's how you pronounce your name I'm really bad at names then again. What youtuber doesn't like read someone's name, and then say I'm so bad at names I feel like that's just like what everybody says like you have to say that she asked me a few questions I noticed you like all the Dolan twins' photos on Instagram What are your thoughts on them? Hot. Question number two: how did you survive being a freshman because it sucks? Um Honestly freshman year sucked for me as well every single year of high school sucked for me to be completely honest But I just like try to be open-minded and like I tried to like kind of immerse myself in the school like these involved as Possible and not kind of distracted me actual like school wise and schoolwork I tried to put as much effort in as I could but I also took it with a grain of salt because obviously Freshman year you're adjusting from like middle school homework, which is like literally like so easy to like high school work Which is actually like hard and like time-consuming and stuff like that but by sophomore year, you kind of get the hang of it So just like be patient with yourself and with the work and just do your best and try to have fun go to all the school events go to football games do all that stuff get involved because Freshman year is when you're the most excited about high school so like try to take advantage of that excitement That's all I have to say. Thank you for your questions in your letter Kailyn again. You're so sweet last letter We're gonna be opening today is from Keira again. Sorry if I'm bad with names huh oh my god It looks like she gave me a keychain which I love keychains because I always put them on my keys But I'm gonna look at that after I read the letter because I'm a good person and you know you're supposed to read the letter First oh my god. She has such good handwriting. Oh Thanks, Keira. Oh my god. I'm so excited you have no clue right now. Oh my god. This is so freaking cute This is a little iced latté keychain thing. Oh my god. If that isn't the cutest thing you've ever seen I don't know who's so freakin cute. Thank you so much Keira you're so sweet Thank you to everybody who sent me a letter sent me a package, art, whatever I literally love it so much we all have so much in common And it's always like so crazy because it's like you'll like write and like tell about yourself, and I'm like holy SH Why is this me? I think it's really cool. I'm on to my last sushi roll now, so that's good, I'm kind of sad though because these never make me full Broke my straw and now there's a broken piece of plastic in this drink, so I have to like empty it all out So I don't accidentally drink plastic [Mom laughing] Wow I'm really honored that I can make my own mother laugh We're gonna be applying this mask on my face today Because I don't know I haven't done a face mask in a while, and I was kind of feeling it This is the yes to cucumbers calming paper mask I am hashtag dying wow I look good like this oh Man, I look good. It smells, so good smells like cucumber dreamy dreams Cucumber dreams So many rooms like a complete mess you probably can't really tell, but like I've clothes all over my room I'm just gonna sit. I look so fucking weird. I look so weird I'm just going to catch up on my subscriptions and have a good time. A little date with me and computer here with my merch sticker. Merch link in bio. We got my strawberry smoothie here pretty iconic I haven't talked about it in a while, but it's definitely a staple in my diet It's really good really simple really refreshing despite the fact that it's like kinda cold out It's not that cold out, but it's kind of cold like it's not really smoothie weather This is super sour, but I like it because I like sour stuff But if you don't like sour stuff then maybe you should put some sugar in it or something but I don't do that. Anyway, my camera is about to die, and that's really bad, so I'm gonna end today's vlog. I hope you enjoyed it, if you did give it a thumbs up, subscribe to my channel, comment down below anything you want. I know I didn't really do anything too extravagant and today's vlog but it was a pretty raw day in my life like this is what my days are actually Like rather than like me doing cool stuff like going thrifting and like other stuff like that. I don't do that every day I wish I did, but I don't hope you enjoyed Hope it wasn't too boring, and I can't wait to see you next time. Love you all appreciate you"

Up or something like that for like the next season cuz cheer is like year-round so it's like there's literally a two-week period where you don't have practice and then you start a new season there's like it's all year-round it never ends during this two-week period i was dying to like practice and stuff because i was anxious because i wanted to be ready for tryouts there's this kind of thing that you can go to called open gym which is basically where like you pay like $5 or $10 or something and then you get to tumble as much as you want in the gym tumble stunt whatever you can just Practice so my gym personally didn't do open gyms And so i had been searching everywhere for an open gym so i was yelping and i was looking around online and i found this gymnastics place that did open gyms and it said online Anyone's welcome and i was like oh dope i called them up and i was like hi like when's your open gym or whatever like Can i come by and they're like yeah like our open gyms are friday's from 3 to 5 or whatever Anyone's welcome or whatever at friday rolls around and i'm ready to go to this open gym right i'm excited because i need to tumble I roll on over there like no One's business i walk in and i look around and there's a bunch of moms and i'm like okay whatever maybe like the class just Ended i don't know there's like a birthday party or something at the gym and like everybody's leaving Before open gym starts so something i was like okay so i'm like waiting around and the moms are sticking around and the babies there's Babies everywhere all of a sudden i realize i'm like okay so all these moms have kids okay so i walk up to the front desk and i give To her my $5 and i'm like oh like i'm here for the open gym and she was this open gym is like mommy and me open gym so it's only for like moms and like toddlers under 4 years old how did i miss that how did i like not realize that it was a mommy and me open gym for like moms and their kids only i had when i called on the phone and like when i looked online like how did that detail just like skip my Head that's just i don't know okay moving on next story is probably my most embarrassing Uh-hum In fifth grade i feel like i might have told this story like on a live stream or something before so if you've heard It before i'm sorry but if you haven't buckle your seat belt so everybody was like required to play an instrument in fifth grade whether it was like band orchestra Whatever so i chose to do orchestra which was my first mistake and i played the cello okay i was like maybe four foot six and Like 50 pounds but i was playing the cello which is our second mistake but that's fine at the end of the year there's like this big like orchestra show all the kids come in and we have like a big show for the parents where we all like show what we've been learning all year and stuff like that and so you know me being the Cello player aka the backbone of the orchestra you know i was pretty excited for this that is complete sarcasm i hated orchestra i literally quit after fifth grade and never played again i absolutely did not like it i literally would like fake play like i Would hover like the bow over the like strings or whatever i wouldn't actually play is what i'm trying To say and i'd like let everybody else who's sitting near me like kind of take my job anyways So end of the year we have this big orchestra show of course i'm nervous because i'm like umm i suck at orchestra and like we have this huge show and if i fuck up i'm screwed like that's gonna be so embarrassing but then not only that like i've never i actually Haven't even played the cello at all this whole year i've literally been faking it this entire year but now the Parents are coming around and everything i should really try you know we perform i actually did it okay i did decent not too bad you
know So the show's over and at the end the orchestra teacher said that he was gonna announce awards for like the you know most improved like best overall team player shit like that and i'm 100% sure that i will not be receiving one 100% sure it will not be me me and the teacher both know that um Cello is not for me so i knew that that was out of the question and so i was just chillin you know The microphone to all the parents okay sorry in the microphone in front of all the parents and everything he says i'd like to have all the cello players stand up and i Was like doh so i stand up but i look around and i'm like guys why aren't you guys standing up and then i look in front of me and i see one other girl standing up who's also a Cello player but we were the only two people standing up and i look To the kid to my right who also plays cello and i was like why aren't you standing up it's all the cello players stand up because like emma stick down i'm like what so i sit down and i'm like wait what's the issue here like he said all cello players stand up i was standing up You're the one who's in the wrong here and you should have stood up too you know he's like no? emma he was announcing the winner of most improved and he called Blanks name and told her to stand up i don't know where you heard all the cello players stand up he was just Awarding this one girl for most improved so okay if that didn't make any sense to you basically what happened was in short he awarded Some girl most improved i accidentally stood up with her in the entire school and all the parents were so confused as to why i was standing up while this other girl was supposed to be getting the award it was quite confusing and upsetting this next Story happened in about fourth grade i don't remember this isn't even embarrassing this is just weird as hell so we might dad used to go to the library all the time he would like pick up books and i would like look at magazines and books rarely books because i don't like reading also it was at the time when i had an ipod touch i don't think anybody's used an ipod touch since like 2007 so like i'm not sure i don't know maybe i'm wrong so i had an ipod touch and obviously To use an ipod touch and to use like apps and the internet and stuff you need wi-fi and the library had wi-fi but at The time my house didn't even have wi-fi which is weird to think i went To the library almost every night with my dad so one day
On the way to the library me my dad walked there my dad like stopped me he points over to a house He's like look and i look on the ground and lo and behold there is a crap like this big like a mini little crab just Sitting on this person's front lawn and my dad is a lover of animals for sure and so he was like we can't just let This crap stay here and die it's doomed if we don't save it so my dad was like okay here's what we're gonna do we're Gonna take the crab with us to the library do our normal library routine and then after we're done with the library we'll take it To the ocean or something and let it free my dad was carrying a little like tote bag sort of thing with all of his books that he knew To return in it and he decided to just put the crap in the back and we go to the library i'm looking at the magazines and my dad's like in another area of the library and all of a sudden my dad comes up to me which never used To happen we would just end up meeting up later it was never but he runs to the kids section and finds me in like very nervous and like anxious and i'm like what's up what's going on He's like emma I lost the crab and i was like what do you mean you lost the crab she was like when i put my book down it escaped This is so weird i left the bag somehow i don't know it's not in my bag anymore and that's like what we have to fucking find the crab it's running loose in The library at the front of the library there's this huge counter with a bunch of? librarians like lined up basically checking out people's books after looking for like literally 15 minutes we glanced over at that front counter thing with all the Librarians a bunch of people waiting in line and nuzzled up against the counter was the little crowd there's people everywhere and it's just like it's just kind of pressed up against the freaking counter how do you even explain this To someone if they See what's going on here okay imagine a dad and his daughter? walking up to the front cutting everyone in line pushing everyone out of the way to pick up a crab off the ground and then runs Out of the store that's a little bit weird but we're like do you know what this is our only option here we're not just Gonna leave the crab here in the freaking library where my dad runs to the front of the library Slyly picks up the crab shoves it in the bag and we leave no one actually saw the crab as far as we know but it was pretty wild what an experience of a lifetime anyway long story short we let it free in the ocean and it's probably doing great it probably is a family now if it's watching this right now i hope you and the kids are doing well i miss you and i'm glad that i saved your life okay So next i'm going to talk about one of the crushes that i had in like elementary school i think so i had a really big crush on this kid i'm not gonna obviously say his names i don't want to expose him he was just this cute little tan Kid you know had a crush on him i don't know what else to say about it but i was like obsessed with him for Sure and i was in love with him from like Kindergarten to like fourth grade and it never ended i don't think the feeling was mutual but What can you do his family was from hawaii and he was so cute he's like a surfer you know his whole house was like decked out with like kind of beachy stuff you know you'd like some beachy house decor i thought that was pretty cool i used to have these pants that were the brand Roxy and you know what you guys probably know what the brain roxy is it's like a surfer brand and i had like one pair of pants from there and i was obsessed with these pants they were like capris that Like got tight at the end i think this was either in first or second grade i thought it'd be a good idea to wear these roxy pants to school To impress my beachy surfer friend slash crush we'll call him christopher i don't know why i chose that name but anyways i was ready to freakin finesse this kid with my roxy pants at school The next day and i normally didn't wear these to school For some reason so like they've never been seen before i was ready for the big debut So i wear these pants to school, and i am just being the most extra i can be trying, to like make him notice that i'm wearing roxy pants you know he always wore quicksilver which is the brother brand To roxy i'm pretty sure like i'm pretty sure they're like connected like quicksilver is like the boy version of roxy so he always wear That brand so like i was like oh yeah like i'm about To finesse him right now that he's gonna think i'm so dope the whole day was by i'm just trying To like rub my pants in his face i'm like you know putting my leg on close to his head and it numbers good But like i want him to notice my pants the end of the day rolls around it's like the last hour of school and i'm like this has not noticed my pants yet and like i'm pissed so i decide that you know what i'm just gonna like i'm just gonna be blunt with him and i'm just gonna tell him Check out my fucking pants bro you're gonna like this and you're gonna like me after this so i'm like yo like christopher check out my pants roxy you know bg brand surfer girl that's me I was like aren't these pants dope and like do you like me yet like are we like soul mates or what his? he said nothing his eyes just got Super big and he just like walked away i scared him away you know a few weeks later i was sitting next to him in class and we had like a storytime we basically just have this thing we're like people from the community would like come in and read us books like a firefighter policeman librarian somebody would like come in once a week and like read us a cool story that like related to their profession if that makes sense so We have that like every friday so is friday a few weeks after this whole roxy pant incident happened i'm sitting next To him because of course you best believe i should have all the witches out of the way and i sit next to his ass Because you know got a crush like gotta like be close, to him at all times obviously i'm a freaky bitch you know you know We were sitting on the rug in the front of the class listening to the teacher i look over and i see him picking his Nose do you know what in about 1st or 2nd grade that wasn't too out of whack you know that's pretty? Expected nose picking was something that was the norm you know we were all used to it so i wasn't really too phased i ended up seeing him you know picking his nose and then putting it on a block like you know a building block like he just like wiped it onto a building block and then like put it back into the pile i don't know something about that kind of Traumatized me in a relationship was never the same i still had crushes on him for like the next two and a half years about But it just wasn't the same once you see something like that you know you're scarred for life so the crush kind of lessened after that and i realized you know what he might not like your roxy pants but you've seen him put his booger on a block so it's kind of even last but not least we're gonna be talking about me basically just being a pussy this was also in elementary school it was crazy hat day at school where we would all come in and wear crazy hats i used to really go all out when it was fair days and i would really just deck my snout I wouldn't hold back you know i would like go to the store and like specifically buy things for spirit days and spirit weeks like i was into it you can only imagine There's a lot on the way i wanted to live up to my other spirit day Standards me and my mom go to target or the dollar store or something like that and just pick up a pic and pick out A top hat and then buy a bunch of random to hot glue onto that hat so i bought this bright gold top hat and i glued a bunch of shit all over it we spent hours on this hat and it was dope it had like puff balls on it it had like glitter on it and had googly eyes on it it had pipe cleaners on it it had shit all over it it was wet but to make the hat ten times better i was like do you want me To do i'm To hot glue a rubber duckie on top of the hat just to top it all off i stroll into school I'm proud of the shit, me and my mom worked so hard on it and i was really Emotionally attached to this hat it's rolling to school and i'm Feeling like a savage i am getting endless amounts of attention for this hat i mean people are just googling eyes over it and of course i was like yeah this is my fucking hat god you know what i mean i was in love with it i love the attention but some of the rowdy boys in my class started to get a little bit out of hand they were so obsessed with this hat they just could not get their hands off of it kept touching it and like trying to like pull things off of it and stuff and i was getting hashtag pissed because i was like yeah i just spent like an hour and a half on this hat and you are getting your grimy ass foger pickin ass Hands on it and i'm not happy about it but i was like you know what i'm just gonna keep my cool it's fine? It's whatever all of a sudden some bitch-ass boy has the nerve to pull the rubber duckie off the top of the hat now that my friend was the final straw i burst into tears i was bawling about this i was So upset i spent hours on this hat and you have the nerve to come up here and take the rubber duckie off like you Own the place no, no honey that's not how it works i was furious So for the rest of the day i cried i did not stop crying i didn't go out For recess i didn't do anything and eventually i had to go home because i was so upset that that kid hooked the rubber duckie Off the top of my hat that i literally had to go home I don't know it was really emotional for me you know what i'm a sensitive kid okay i have been forever and so that's just an example of that so i think that that's it for my story times yeah i had fun if you want more story times in the future give this video a thumbs up and subscribe and comment down below anything that you want i love you all Appreciate you all and i cannot wait to see you next time"
_wWI3Efv9Zg,"IF SOUP MAKES YOUR NOSE RUN, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS",true life: im addicted to soup,2017-11-05T20:27:36Z,103219,3363117,3362,"Good mor - oh Good morning, vlog. So start off today's vlog, We're gonna do some DIY crafts, so if you saw my vlog a few weeks ago You know that I accidentally thrifted this Abercrombie t-shirt, that's so boring and ugly and I was definitely upset about it. Last thing I bought I'm so pissed about I spent ten dollars on this fucking shirt. Okay, let me explain myself. when I first looked at this, I thought that it was like a Polo Ralph Lauren shirt, but it's a fucking Abercrombie shirt. It's an Abercrombie shirt. I spent $10 on a used Abercrombie shirt. I have like 500 of those from literally eighth grade. So I decided that I would order some patches. I ordered this one and this one. And I would use one of those to cover the Abercrombie patch, so that it's like a cool shirt and nobody ever knew that it was an Abercrombie shirt. Because it's actually really soft, and it's a good quality shirt So why not make it dope? I got this patch from the Etsy shop ""Total pansy."" I'm not really that good at this kind of stuff even though literally the first video I ever made - no like the second or third video I ever did on this channel was like a DIY Embroidered vans tutorial where I had to use an ironing board, But I'm still not good. (Emma's Mom) I'm dying. (Emma) Why? Cause I covered the Abercrombie logo? I know is such a nice soft shirt that is just what I said That's so great yeah Let's get crafting. Just waiting for it to heat up. Any day now It's done. Okay. Something smells like it's burning. It. Just smells like the fabric like softener in there. It's kind of heating up Hopefully I don't burn the house down Again. As you can see, we have this nice, vintage, like 70s font on this nice, soft, Good quality ,Abercrombie t-shirt and no one would ever know there we go That's your lesson of the day pat on the back for me So my dad rented a little house kind of thing by the beach, and he told me yo Emma You can come along if you want, and I said sure he rented it for work Not for really luxury that make sense like it's not like a vacation. It's more something for work for him so right now I'm driving up to that beach house thing. Oh my god. Hi Sorry, you are stupid It's literally only like I don't even know like 40 minutes away from my house like it's really not far But I'm excited because I'm gonna explore the area because I don't really hang out around there very much. Just gonna vlog it you know sadly it's like really cold, so it's not like I can like swim in the ocean or anything I Just pulled up to the coffee place And I literally realize I still have a coffee in here that I haven't even finished. I am such a bad person What a real mess what a real tragedy? Honestly as you can see it is quite a flashy exterior look at all those polka dots So I'm going to get lunch now because it's about two o'clock, and I'm freaking hungry, and I want to get some food so Starting route to 107 ok series Oh, I yelped and I found this place called the press and it looks like they have cute food And there's like some outdoor seating and stuff And it's cute all I ate today was like some special kind of bagel made out of like this special kind of meat anyway Yeah My bagel was made out of special wheat? What's your bagel made out of there's a thrift store near the place that I'm gonna be eating and it's just like a small One-off little thrift store the best thrift stores are the ones in little towns that like nobody Goes to so like a thrift store like this is gonna have some great because nobody's looking through it you go to like San Francisco Or like a big city, and you go thrifting. Everything is going to be picked through because everybody's already been there here Not as much so I'm prom for that. Oh my god Don't hit me Food was an a-plus wait do I need my teeth oh? I totally do salad was like three dollars. It was really good It was just a simple salad you know just had the simple ingredients But like it was good had a nice vinaigrette wasn't too heavy. It was great soup I got some tomato soup really good tomato soup really tasty nice flavor a little bit Spicy kind of my nose is definitely running a little bit now. I'm going to the thrift store that I was talking about earlier It's called alternative thrift. It looks like ohh. Oh my god. It's so close. It is two minutes away. Oh my god Well don't mind if I do funny How it's like November first, and I'm at the beach, but literally that's how California is you can't escape summer It's summer all year round here. There's like one week a year That's cold, and the rest you're just like well mine is well be wearing a bikini. Hey. Hey, wait a minute mr. Postman I'm glad a minute mr. Postman If you know that vine we're friends we're here That was a hashtag fail because they don't even take credit card and that's all I have S mhm but I didn't find anything I liked anyways there was nothing what a shame, but you know what not every threatening trip is a success yeah now I'm gonna go check out the room and I'm gonna unpack my stuff even though We're only gonna be here for like two days of course I packed like way too much stuff, but you know you never know what you're gonna need whoa. This is so cute Wow Oh my god. What the Frick oh? Okay, a few hours of past. I have just been editing all sudden. I look outside hashtag goals pretty nice Good Marni, okay, we have to go get coffee now. It's just it's a necessary thing. I started off my morning with tea That's just so wrong that needs to be fixed immediately. It was good. Don't get me wrong It was like mint tea or something it was good. Okay. It was but it's not the same, so let's go Did you tell your friends about the crosstalk wait? Oh? Yeah? I had some of my dad's croissant Do you know what no this is what it was he didn't want to eat it because he knew it's bad for him So he wanted to shove it down my throat instead so that I would eat it instead actually. That's not it What it is is I wanted her to experience? Marmalade for the first time last time we get it you've been to France before yeah I thought my fault I've never been to France before I can't relate to his croissant memories I've never had a good croissant in my entire life. Why this is the ugliest angle of 2017? I should literally get an Oscar for this angle oh My god, how goals this is so cute goals coffee right here Beach bagels? No, not bagels Bay goals Ah He filled it all the way with Armand bellman, but then at the end she filled the rest of it with Brigitte I know if I end up getting bellyache later, then we'll know for sure Absolutely mind-boggling news just sitting here minding my own business when all of a sudden my dad yells dolphin And I'm like okay stop playing games. No not games. There's dolphins over there I didn't know that there was dolphins in Northern, California, but um now that I know the game has been changed I don't ever need to go on a tropical vacation again She don't want no freaking Eber Grab on to the frickin tentacle of one of those I can just go for a ride fin technical same thing my dad also just Reported in uninvited that when there's dolphins around that means that there's no sharks Also this coffee pretty good, but I don't know if you heard what I was saying earlier but I think that he filled up this coffee with almond milk then put in the Espresso and then topped off the top with a little bit of regular milk You know if I was lactose intolerant, um, which I'm not even though I am sensitive to milk But I'm not like to his intolerant the toilet would have a very sad surprise when I got home I think he's setting me up for failure, and he's setting me up for a big poop in the toilet later. Sorry I'm just gonna stop now before I get demonetized. Just spent the last few hours editing and I felt like you know what I deserve a little cup of mint tea It is good mint tea is good It's November now, so I'm wearing a sweater to be spirited pretty pumped actually because I love sweaters And I love turtlenecks and so like even though the weather still isn't really sweater weather yet, but I'm just pushing my limits here I'm literally covering my double chin with this sweater. See that's why I like turtlenecks I only brought one pair of ankle socks So now I have to wear like mid ankle calf mid calf ankle socks with vans and jeans And it's just like not a cute look at all it looks definitely funky But we're working with it the fashion police can take a nap because it's not my fault okay I wasn't prepared like I stepped in water in the bathroom with my ankle socks and like that was just the worst mistake you know Can't wear them again. You feel me How that burned my throat okay, so originally I have this coffee shop in thrift store in mind But I thought they closer to here, but it's actually not at all close. It's actually really far from here It's like 30 minutes away. I don't know. I just didn't seem worth it to me to drive 30 minutes Just for one coffee shop in 1/3 stores when there is many Around here that I've never even tried and that are probably really good ok this might be actually a coffee shop right here It is I'm going in that was really easy. I didn't even have to Yelp anything anyway well I just found a coffee shop. It's called the bar, and it looks like so we'll just go in there Do you know what everything happens for a reason? Maybe this place is gonna be really great I'm still a little bit sad that like the other place didn't work out because it's 30 minutes away, but you know what it's okay Look how freaking cute OMG and like look how cute this little wood number is 18   Cute not my favorite number, but close actually I don't even have a favorite number I don't know what I'm talking about and I'm just sitting outside in nature enjoying nature I ordered soup and an iced almond milk latte. I don't even remember what kind of like soup it is.I just ordered it Hopefully, it's good. We'll see wish me luck pray for me Wow look at her oh My god really really good. Oh my god. Yeah, that's some good right there Done if you're in Half Moon Bay check it out, baby my nose running because the soup is kind of spicy I don't even know I can't control my nostrils like there's snot just dripping everywhere I never eat soup like it's just not something so normal part of my diet, but no joke the two restaurants I've been with you guys over the past like two days I've eaten soup which I think is so random you guys probably think that I really am into soup But I'm not I mean I like it, but like they don't normally eat it. I was gonna Go do some other dope stuff, but honestly. I'm so tired for some reason I always get tired when I sleep in hotels I never sleep as good as I do at home So I'm gonna go back to the room and take a nap it's literally three o'clock, but I feel like it's 5:00 p.m. That was it for this vlog I hope you enjoyed my little trip vlog sort of I don't even know what this was. if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want Love you appreciate you so much, and yeah, and I can't wait to see you next time  "
02Nm2B4hkYc,TRYING INSTAFAMOUS FOODS,why r these foods more instafamous than i will ever be,2017-11-02T21:25:51Z,194735,6172661,3604,"What's my second favorite thing after coffee - food POP What's up guys so today, I'm in San Francisco wait where the fuck are my sunglasses what the hell? oo WAH AH AH AH Okay this lady starring at me I had this bright idea That was slightly inspired by BuzzFeed because I feel like this is something that they would do this lady needs to get her eyes off Off me, I literally can't film anymore [Navigator: turn left on Sonora Stream.] I'm already here. She's totally staring at me Just because you're wearing sunglasses doesn't mean I can't see your eyes, okay So I'm in San Francisco today because I had this bright idea and she's back staring at me, okay Do you know why I'm annoyed now. This is my privacy I'm just gonna have like I'm on the phone because that makes things less awkward You know cuz then it looks like I'm like doing something. Oh, maybe she can hear me I think she can hear me so I have the bright idea to come to San Francisco today and try three Instagram famous Foods I've never tried any of them And I always see people posting at these specific three locations getting specific items off the menu And I was like you know I thought it would be kind of fun to just go around and enjoy three Instagram Bay foods you know what I'm saying it would just be fun It would give me something to post on Instagram too, and yes, that's what we're doing today so this is definitely something I feel like BuzzFeed would do I'm not sure if they've done it something exactly like it before I'm channeling my Inner food critic today, and we're gonna. Have a good-ass time First location we're going to today is called home cafe in the Sunset District of San Francisco They're famous food item is like the birthday cake law I'll insert a photo basically Everybody gets these and post them on Instagram because they're so cute or whatever and I've lived in this area for like my entire life But I've never been here before as you guys know I am a coffee connoisseur I love coffee, but I only like iced almond mocha lattes That's the only drink that I get so this will be a little bit interesting a birthday cake latte I don't know how I'm gonna feel about it. It could really go either way I could either love it or hate it because like I like iced drinks, and this is a hot drink So that's like the first error. I also don't really like sweet coffee drinks, so if it's too overpowering I'm probably gonna hate it, but we'll see I'm really pumped because it looks super good like it looks so cute So I'm walking to it right now, and it's in a super chill location like no one is around here at all It's like a ghost town a little bit, which is always creepy, but I don't judge when you're in the city And it's like super crowded I always get really anxious so five stars for the location because it's in a super chill location and that's a plus thumbs up Okay, well haven't even tried the coffee yet though, so that's kind of the important part. Okay update I'm getting a little bit closer to the actual cafe. I don't really like this area I don't know yeah, that's okay because it's all about the coffee itself, but yeah I take back what I said earlier about it being cute. It is definitely chill, but like I feel like sketchy I don't know something about this area bill you have to get like So let's give a full comprehensive review as Casey nice that would say first, let's discuss Instagram ability because that's the whole point of this freakin video definitely artsy as hell I took this picture And it's definitely artsy definitely goals the latte art is the whole point of it basically I mean like the flavor is good for sure it actually tastes really good I got it with almond milk instead of regular milk And it tasted really good tasted more like a hazelnut vanilla latte rather than like birthday cake cake batter If that makes sense this doesn't actually taste like cake it wasn't too, sweet, which was really good It was like a pleasant amount of sweetness It wasn't too hot when she gave it to me so like I could drink it Immediately which is a thumbs-up also to make it even better the inside is actually really nice too like actual like Decor and stuff people and they were nice, but I did have trouble finding a seat in the beginning And then I had to like share a table with some lady that I didn't know and she didn't really seem too excited to share A table with me, but I was like we got to do something here a lot of people in their computers You know working hard, but there's this little sign that says like this table like you can't use laptops at this table Which I thought was kind of funny like because they want you to enjoy each other's company Which I think is kind of cute. I guess kind of a cute gesture You know I would rate it a nine out of ten The only reason why I would dock a point is just because this area although. It's chill and stuff It's just kind of a boring area. There's not much really going on around here, so it's like if you went to this cafe It's not you could like go somewhere else after and like have a lid as time. You know Next location we're going to is called the mill it's on Divisadero Street I believe the mill is basically like a coffee place it has famous avocado toast And you might be like everywhere it sells avocado toast, and you'd be right But what makes their avocado toast different is that they make their own bread so like it's homemade bread that they make in that literal Like cafe like they make the bread in the cafe, and it's also just a super dope like location like really cool it's actually been there before for coffee, but I've never been there before for this avocado toast because Unpopular opinion here, I'm not a huge avocado person Mostly because I'm a picky eater and like I just don't really like I don't know like avocado kind of freaks me out a little Bit feel me but despite my kind of like fear of avocados and they get the avocado just today I have a feeling I'm gonna like it I mean everyone likes avocado toast everybody and their mom and I've like never tried it before so That's where we're going next. This is definitely cute area for sure for sure way cuter than the last area I'd say oh my god Sorry really windy very windy extremely windy this place is really cute aesthetic so I hate that word, but it's true It's really cute. There's like this outdoor sitting area you Time to review okay overall I was pretty impressed with this experience It was quite pricey though like that avocado toast was eight dollars the look of the place Very artsy very dope I liked it a lot. They had nice wood tables They had a few marble tables Which were taken so I couldn't use those which is depressing because marble tables look really good and Instagram photos for food and stuff But anyways either way now let's talk about the flavors coffee not the best I've had to be completely honest. It was good Don't get me wrong. It was good, but it wasn't the best I've had. It was kind of bitter a little bit Maybe kind of sour supposedly they have homemade almond milk, which is really cool I couldn't really tell, but like that's cool now the toast was my first time ever having avocado toast It was definitely good only issue with this one specifically was that there was like some avocado like strings in it Do you know I'm talking about like avocado like fibers Oh, I don't know But that just like really grosses me out like you know when there's like little strings knock On the avocado something got strings in my food and like fibers and my food really fucking grosses me out didn't taste gross But it's just like there's a little bit of that avocado is kind of brown like it wasn't super green which is okay? But not as like aesthetically pleasing is that make sense I don't judge You know cuz the flavor was actually really good the actual bread part was Unreal because it's homemade right ain't like my teeth just sunk into that like there's no tomorrow. It was unbelievable It was so freakin good. I was ecstatic I'm not even a huge avocado fan And I still liked it so like if you liked avocado like you would definitely die for that Yeah, I would read the entire experience in eight out of ten the avocado was kind of brown But it was still really artsy and I took this picture and it looks pretty freakin good Actually, I'd say an 8.5 out of 10 thumbs up for the mil good place cool vibes. Good vibes dope vibes We're going to buy right ice cream which is like the most famous ice cream place in San Francisco people freaking love it there It's like just a fuckin family fave a lot of people like it and it's really close to the last place I was at coincidentally they're famous for like they're kind of like cool Ice cream flavors like cheesecake, and I don't even know but regular ice cream gives me tummy troubles I'm not lactose intolerant, but like milk just does not agree with me at all You know it's just not meant for my body, so I'm gonna get the vegan ice cream from there I think they have one flavor It's like chocolate coconut ice cream made with coconut milk instead of regular milk a lot of people take pictures there It's like a huge fan favorite. You know what I mean everyone goes there. I feel like I Have to go back to the car to try this one because they don't have any seeds in there so that's something to consider I Have the ice cream and I already tried a little bit of it, and it's really good about me eat more It tastes really good. Maybe a little bit less creamier than regular ice cream It's still pretty creamy super rich chocolate flavor definitely a fan then another vegan flavor, too I think was a sorbet, but I'm more of a chocolate person than like sorbet You know I strap some of it on my white pants That's a mess sometimes chocolate ice cream can just taste like water. This is good stuff even though I've always been a vanilla kind of girl But this is looking good as hell and taste and everything I give it a 10 out of 10 But here's where the issue is it's cute in there Don't get me wrong, but it's not really like instagram-worthy like this just looks like basic chocolate ice cream You know what I mean So I give this overall a 6 out of 10 because this whole point of today is trying Instagram foods You know places that are super insta-goals right the food itself is not that instagram-worthy especially compared to the other two things that we've Experienced today at the end of the day if you want a good scoop of ice cream I'd say this is a good place also It's like connected to a grocery store that like takes away from like the potential cuteness does that make sense and the guy in there? Was really nice which always helps Do my tums like Brown honestly I'd say all those places were good even though the last one wasn't really Instagram goals I didn't even take a picture of my ice cream I just started eating it because I just got no inspo You know I wasn't inspired by the location all of the places were really good, and if you're in San Francisco I'd say for sure check it out. I literally drank so many coffees today. I Okay, wait I only have two actually no I had three I had two on screen But then I had one off screen when no one was looking I need to like go home and calm down after that free coffees In the span of like two hours is definitely a lot for me and trying to cut down on the caffeine You know try not to drink as much coffee or at least get decaf, but I've been failing miserably But this is not relating to the video anyway. That's it for today's video I hope you enjoyed if you had fun You like this smash the thumbs up button give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want Love you all appreciate you all and I'll see you next time"
Jw82EB5WJbU,HALLOWEEN MAKEUP (i have a lot of talent),happy halloweener!!!!! woohoo.,2017-10-31T21:36:58Z,33960,690278,1419,"What's up guys If you're watching this todayday If you're watching this the day that I post it.*blows dust*  Why is there freaking dust everywhere? If you're watching this theday--the *sits in awe of not being able to English* Oh my god. If you're watching this the day that I'm uploading it *applause yes Emma* that means you're watching this on Halloween. And let's say, you know I don't know. It's last minute and you want to do somethin' cool on your face like makeup *hand sweep* Why? There's dust flying everywhere. I don't know if you can see it, but I can see it and it's pissing me off Anyways, if you want to do some dope makeup because it's Halloween and you wanna celebrate Maybe you want to wear to school. Maybe you want to wear it to work Maybe you just want to wear it in your house. Maybe you want to wear it trick-or-treating I don't know, but let's say that you want to wear some makeup and it's Halloween. This is the tutorial for you I'm gonna be showing you two makeup tutorials Halloween... bae... themed. If you don't like the first one, you can wear the second one, if you like the second one and not the first one You wear the second one. I mean the first one Pretty sure they're gonna be really fun, and I think that it's gonna be great time, so let's just hoppity hop right into it. So the first tutorial we're gonna be doing is candy corn themed. Okay basically I'm almost out of this concealer, so it looks like I need to move on to another one I guess I could use this one You know what, you can actually leave this tutorial just like how it is and be a ghost for Halloween But do you know what, no. That's not what we're doing today We're turning me into a freakin candy corn, so hold your horses. Frick. I forgot to get my Beauty Blender wet God f*cking damnit BRB gotta go wet my fake Beauty Blender *smiles*  Ssssnn *opens door* We're backkk. Okay okay *hyperventilates* Okay, so now that you have your concealer all over your face Just freaking blend it all in. I'm just gonna be spreading it around. I know that that's the incorrect technique But it's a lot faster if you've done It correctly Your skin tones gonna look a little bit lighter than usual. You want to look a little bit lighter because that kind of allows for a really solid base *burps* K, so now that you applied an even coat of concealer all over your entire face, take some powder... setting powder I don't know what the word is. I'm gonna be using this bareMinerals one. That's completely dirty, look at this that is a f*cking mess. And you're gonna wanna take a A sh*t ton of that and just all over you. We're gonna be trying to cover our brows today. If you watched my last makeup tutorial which Was my back to school one, you'd know I do have a little bit of trouble when it comes to covering my eyebrows It's not something that I'm necessarily good at but it's something that's a necessary step, and we're just gonna do it I just start applying as many skin tone, hair products. Hair products.. makeup products to my brows as possible. Oh I promise I know what I'm doing. Let's just blend it out, kind of take the edge off you know Now I need to set my brows Cuz you know they're not exactly how where I want them to be but I've kind of accepted that I don't really know how to hide my eyebrows besides shaving them, shaving them is the only way but You know, I kind of need these, I kind of need them to stick around. So now things are gonna get f*cking Fun as hell. Ow, I'm hurting my ankles. Mm this is a really creepy angle Okay, so things are about to get intense up in here So I'm up close and personal with you guys so that you know I don't know we can really, you know, so I'm gonna be taking today this stupid eyeliner And I'm gonna, you know, not too much though, and we're just gonna draw a triangle *thinks* Is that right, a triangle? A triangle with rounded edges around our head. Oh yeah baby Okay, so now that you have this nice little triangle. Rounded edges. Don't forget I've never seen a candy corn that had sharp edges because that would be #dangerousforkids *sad slo mo* *gasp* that was a real disappointment, crumpled off. It's gone. So now that your head kind of looks like a candy corn I mean you can see right. I have this nice palette here, and I'm just gonna take a brush Do I even have one? Personally I don't even know how I feel about candy corn like I kinda like it, but at the same time I kinda hate it I wouldn't choose candy corn out of a crowd of candy But at the same time if it was sitting in front of me you, best believe I'd shove it down my throat at an alarming rate *puts yellow on lips* Butt hole lips. When Halloween is on a weeknight, it just isn't the same. Halloween is only fun when it's on the weekend because then you Can stay out late and you don't have to be stressed, and it's just better But do you know what who are we to freaking yell at Mother Nature from making Halloween on a Tuesday this year I mean, it's definitely disappointing. We've stepped away a few years, and then it'll be on a weekend again Hmm Just a few years just like the rest of my childhood will be on a weekday. The rest of my childhood should have Appreciated weekend Halloween's when I had the chance. It's not mother nature's fault. She's just trynna help Wow as you can see if this is really coming along nicely. Definitely a time-consuming process But just be patient because, in the long run the end result is priceless now I'm not telling you guys that I'm a beauty guru or anything, but this looks pretty bomb so far I mean, I'm not trying to toot my own horn, and I never try it just accidentally gets tooted like that's just how it is. So next you're gonna wanna take an orange eye shadow see I don't have an orange eye shadow I have this huge palette and a few of these kinda look orange so we're just gonna see what we can do here. Actually, I'm gonna take this bigger brush and really just go in heavy because That last brush took me I don't know f*cking 45 minutes to do this bottom half of my face And I'm not really in the mood to do that anymore. This one kinda looks orange *applies it* *looks at eyeshadow palette like ???* Really trying to load it up around the eyebrow area because as I've said 100 times And I'm gonna continue to say it again we don't want to see the eyebrows in this tutorial. The appearance of the eyebrow hairs tend to ruin the look yeah now we Have the orange around my eyeball area I'm gonna try to load it up a little bit more because you know it's a little bit weak Sauce. It's a little bit weak sauce as you can see okay, that looks better. Last but not least the white now I don't really own a white eyeshadow That's like really pigmented and such because I just simply don't. I think I have one that's kind of shimmery And I think that's just gonna have to do so if you have that at your home. You're set Aheh. I think we're gonna have to *tries to bite it open* No the teeth won't even help I have this little palette here from the brain wet-and-wild which is basically the cheapest one in the section Oh that actually looks absolutely great. A huh you know what I should have never doubted myself That was the creepiest thing I've never seen. This little wet and wild brush that came with it is actually really great, really doing the job for me I must say. WoOoW I'm not trying to toot my own horn as I've said earlier But this low-key looks like f*cking bomb as hell. WoOoOow GuUysSs huh-hoo Guess who looks like a f*cking candy corn? Ready to eat. Bitch Also, little disclaimer I came up with this tutorial and this look on my own A huh ha Yeah. Sorry, I'm looking at myself in the viewfinder cuz I just looked so goddamn good. Not viewfinder. What's that called? Flip out screen? I don't know. I don't know computer language. I mean f*cking camera language god dangit See , look at these details, see what I'm saying here. Huh let me just give you a little montage *beautiful iMovie music with an acoustic guitar fills your ears* *Oh look, I'm a tiger rawr* *a candy corn angel if you will* *candy kiss* That's it for this look. Time, to take it off and get into the next one because guess what we're not done boys. Oh this Has already made me break out. I feel like I have more acne now than I did before welp That's okay, beauty is pain right. Meahh. If you want to have something. That's great to get your makeup off. I recommend this oil-free Eye makeup remover by Neutrogena.Is this sponsored? No of course it's not. Do you really think Neutrogena would sponsor this video?? Honestly They might even sue me for using their product in a video *gasp* I almost spilled my eye makeup removerallovereverywhere. Four, that's a lot. That's like the most I've ever had to use. But this next tutorial will be so worth it. You won't even believe your eyes. Alright First look you know it was simple. It was easy. It was for you amateurs out there. Second look It's gonna be a little bit more intense We're gonna start out with the exact same base as before because that seemed to work pretty well. This next look doesn't even have a theme It's just Halloween Mayhem. Taking everything that you love about Halloween and putting it on my f*cking face. This look tells everybody Yeah, you like Halloween?? Haha funny. Yeah, that's funny. You don't even know what it's like to like Halloween You don't even know anything about Halloween um yeah Where the f*ck is my Beauty Blender, do you know what I shouldn't even be calling it a Beauty Blender Cuz it's not even a real one. Where did it go? Why do I lose everything? I try to be organized And I just lose everything like before Blend out, more like rub out whatever. Now of course you can't forget that powder because this is what just locks all of your base in, you know. I'm trying to use some beauty terms And it's just..not working um. As we know covering my eyebrows wasn't really workin' so well So do you want we're gonna improv, we're gonna turn my eyebrows into bats because what color are bats  ? Oh, I don't know *thinks and stares into space* Black Actually do you what, no. We're gonna turn my eyebrows into one big bat. WoOoW if that looks fucking great OH my god. Why does this look so good. This tutorial wasn't supposed to go that well that wasn't the plan? I was wanting it to look bad so that it be funny But now it just looks too good. So hard being so good at make up ugh Drawing a detailed bat would be much too hard for my wee little brain So, I think that this will do. Now if you're trying to be bat woman or something this look could kind of go as it is But as I explained earlier, this is like a..going all-out look. This like trying to hit 30 birds with one stone It's time to turn our mouth into a skull mouth. Kind of like almost like a sugar skull mouth because we're trying to encapsulate all Vibes of Halloween *gasps* This looks so good. Why does this look so right? UGH So hard being good at everything *hot dayum* Bitch, huh, I look so good. Okay, sorry, but it's not done yet, actually in honor of the sugar skull When I was at Walgreens buying make up for this tutorial because I literally *lights match* Don't have any makeup at my house Um I don't know maybe because I know that I suck at makeup, so I don't even try. No, no don't go out *tries to light sugar skull candle* ~thanks for nothing~ Okay...I found this sugar skull candle, and I was just like holy sh*t Emma if that isn't vibes I don't know what is. So I bought it *Gasps* She's so beautiful. Oh my god Vape *que intense vape music* I'm just gonna set this over here even though you can't see it and actually no.  It's right here Just for the little Halloween vibes. Speaking of sugar skulls. It's pretty colorful right you know We're just gonna kind of spice things up a little bit here. What color our teeth in skulls. Oh, I don't know White WoOoW It basically makes it look like my mouth is teeth. Does that make sense? How dope is that? Um we're gonna have to color it up a little bit We're gonna have to kind of take this to the next level okay, and this is when things start looking bad, Okay that's really bad. Umm I know what can turn this around. I need to.. just focus on me for a second. Yes. This is what it needed This is-this is what it needed I knew it was missing something. WoOw um this looks a little better. At first it did but now I'm not so sure, but you know what? That's okay. Last but not least, to kind of finish off You know finish off the sugar skull section of the face. We're just gonna take some yellow because as you know bright colors It's kind of what the whole Día de los Mua-I'm not gonna even try to say it. As you can see, your mouth basically looks like the day of the dead. GREAT But it's not over yet What's another thing that you think of when you think of Halloween? If you didn't say Frankenstein Then you're stupid. Just kidding. Don't hate me. Like that. Guess what, you just added some Frankenstein to your head. On this side We're gonna be drawing a ghost. Perfect oh my god, that's so bad. Dang it. It totally messed it up Don't worry though because you know what, it doesn't even matter It's the thought that counts last But not least, it's time to draw a haunted house. As you can see, you have this creepy house right here Right do not stress out. I know that you're like ""Emma. That looks like ass."" Yes, I know. Take some yellow Yeah, mm-hmm. The last step of this tutorial is to take this Mario Badescu spray that is with rose water and aloe and all that sh*t. Every single beauty guru and their mother uses this oh *spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray spray* Oh sorry aheh. And it does absolutely f*cking nothing, but do you know what? Because everybody else uses it I think that it would be necessary for me to use it or else nobody would take me seriously Mario, if you're watching this please don't take it personally it's not your fault I just haven't seen any visible results from this my skin still looks like ass, and I'm still f*cking ugly Maybe that's just my own problem *blows candle out* *Soft Smile* *blows again* Vape *GASP*I just blurted hot wax everywhere. I am an idiot. Oh my god. It's all over my bed This is why people don't let me have candles. Okay. This is the final look. Am I proud of it? Yes, but not as much as I should be. I was just trying to encapsulate all the Halloween in one look And I- just I think I'm starting to realize it's impossible. I don't know okay, I'm not meant for the beauty guru life It's just not for me I try it just but it doesn't- this is what I gave you and if you don't like it, then you're just ungrateful That's it for today's video I hope you enjoyed it, if you did give give it a thumbs up, subscribe to my channel, comment down below anything you want I love you all so much, and I can't wait to see you next time. Peace out *throws up gangster peace sign*"
r7A-cfBq2Xw,MEGA VLOG 2017,I added 2017 to the end of the title to make things more intense lol,2017-10-29T23:49:25Z,64152,2298989,3351,"good morning vloooOOoog as you can see i'm wearing black glasses that are the exact same shape as my other glasses that i always wear in vlogs but these ones are black, and i absolutely do not like these at all i accidentally grabbed these instead of my brown and like gold ones or whatever, but do you know what? it's okay. they're not ~that~ bad i'm fucking obsessed with those glasses, and i just miss them oKaY? so starting off today's vlog, i'm fucking going to the gym because ~~grind~~ gainzz whatever :P i don't even want to go, but it's good for me. you know because last night i didn't work out because, i decided it would be a good idea to start watching riverdale on netflix I don't know. I'm not really a TV person to be completely honest I just - I like it, but I don't know. I don't really spend a lot of time watching TV I'd rather watch YouTube, but every once in a while! I'll find a really good TV show, and I will just binge watch the fuck out of it. Started Riverdale I'm not gonna talk about it because obviously not everybody's seen it But it's a really freaking good show and I'm in love with Cole Sprouse He's like just everything I'd want in a man, but he's pretty f***ing perfect, so, yeah. He's just great and like his character, in it's just so good and I uhhuhu I, uh, watched like five episodes. I think last night, and so I stayed up till ABOUT 3:00 a.m. And I did THAT instead of going to the gym. I was like ""well I could go to the gym or I could watch Riverdale"" and therefore I started Riverdale, and I'm fucking exhausted. I am so tired Oh my god don't honk at me. Also. I have to shower at the gym, too because my hair is so dirty like it's not just like it's actually oily like it's GENUINELY dirty like I haven't washed it in like two days No, like three days, almost which is so bad. Please don't do that. Also don't judge me. Okay. I'm a human I can't wash my hair all the time. Who am I trying to impress? You know? Yeah so,  have to shower at the gym, which is never fun. The gym that I go to, if you want a shower there, you have to like fight all of the like middle-aged Ladies to get a frickin shower because like everybody's fighting over the freaking showers because they all want it or whatever and they're all like Just walking around the locker room Just butt-ass naked, which is totally okay, and I'm not judgmental or weird about it, but I'm just not that way you know I'm not just ready to just strut my stuff in the locker room completely butt-ass naked I don't know. That's just not my style okay, but yeah, I don't really like showering at the gym I prefer showering in the comfort of my own home. Just because to me just feels more secure it feels more safe You know the doors to each shower They don't even lock so like you could easily just like somebody could easily just pull up in the door and just see your ass And naked oh, yeah, it's leg day. You know got to love leg day. No one really talks about arm day You know it's always about leg day. Everyone's always complaining after a leg day. No one ever complains after arm day arm day Doesn't get enough credit, but maybe it's just because people aren't working out their arms hard enough, you know I mean, I know I probably don't my arms are never sore why I don't know Maybe because I'm not forgetting grinding hard enough in the gym And I'm with my stupid and rambling I do this every time But I don't know this is why I should get a frickin podcast. I admire Kody hoes pote podcast Podcast are you kidding me. That is so illegal? Ah? You oh wait, that's literally like a Western espresso coffee and tea It's a coffee van, so I shouldn't get mad at them actually because they are supporting what I love anyways I really admire Cody cause podcast because I don't know it just seems fun and like it's a lot of work It looks like but I love talking. I think that doing a podcast would be something that was good for me I don't really know how to do a podcast So I will probably do one, but I think podcasts are fun One day maybe in the future when I'm an old man, or a woman like what I'm older I'll do a podcast just reach the gym, and oh did I sign a parking spot is this person pulling out? I think they're pulling out are they blowing out to these plow. Yes, they just pulled out Oh literally turn on my camera to be like there's no parking s mhm You know like freaking throw a fit about it. No no I can't go to the gym So sad I can't go to the gym dang it leg day cancelled But you know what never mind still got to go to the gym. Yeah, it sucks really sucks But I'm excited because after this I'm gonna go check my video box and maybe we'll do a little peel box opening so at least I have that to look forward to Okay, just went to my P.O. box just picked up some stuff So let's open a few things that I got I open every single package read every single letter love all that stuff Do not get me wrong you do not go unnoticed. I just can't put every single one in a video I hope you can understand so first we have a package from Amelia who oh is this slime Yes, it's fine So sweet Yes, I could play with slime from the rest of my life, I'm serious Whoo the next one's called locked a gang, so I'm assuming. This is like supposed to be coffee kind of let's try it out Mmm. Oh. Oh my god, this is so sticky, and I'm in my car this could be potentially really bad. Oh Thanks Amelia you're freakin, homie, and you know that I need help with slime, so thank you okay max ooh, we have something from Rowan, sorry if I said your name wrong Okay, first time I read the letter Wow thank you so much like this literally touched my heart oh my god I feel like a new woman after reading that that like literally made me almost cry I'm serious Anyways last letter. I'm reopening today is from Sophia and Emily, so let's see what's up. Oh yes They freaking made Gucci shirts if that isn't the best thing I've ever seen ever I don't know. What is I don't know if you can see that by the way? I love seeing when you guys make fake Gucci shirts. It's my favorite thing all time They asked me a few questions, so I'm gonna answer those questions number one Why do you have a little cross stick in your room? Okay? So this is kind of a funny story? I just quit cheer and I was like you wanna try something new I'm gonna do lacrosse right so me my friend Did a bunch of lacrosse clinics and? It was super fun like I really like lacrosse we were like ready to try out in spring we were like you know prepping we Were like ready we were like down like you're excited But then tryouts time came around and all my friends were like Emma You should really do track like I feel like you like it better, and I was like yeah, okay? So then I ended up doing track instead of lacrosse because they're both in the same seats And you're I already knew that what is your hardest humbling pass and could you do it four or insert a video? I haven't done any tumbling in literally A long time a year probably my hardest tumbling pass when I did do chair like a punch front through the layout Sometimes like I literally did that twice like punch front through the layout But I don't even have a video of that so I'll insert like a few videos of me tumbling right now Okay, that's all I'm opening for today if I didn't open yours please don't hate me. You know a few hours past and You know I got home from the post office And you know laid down on my bed one thing led to another and I watched like 500 episodes of Riverdale now 3:30 And I'm hungry as hell guess where I'm going. I'm going to pressed. You. Don't know what pressed is I say this in every single vlog But like I always just assume that you guys don't know just in case press juice place that has Vegan frozen yogurt made out of juice okay, it's hella good. You'll see in a minute. It's so good for a second I was like you know what Emma you're only gonna go get pressed juice or whatever But like you should wear something kind of cute like wear something. You know presentable right um. No. That's not gonna happen I'm literally wearing a t-shirt workout shorts, and then the most ugly shoe combination of all time Okay, also if you're like Emma. It's frickin fall Why the hell are you wearing like shorts and like a t-shirt and like not like a sweater because in California, it's still Frickin hot and so I have to use this fan But like I'm in the mood for some frickin fall vibes and like the fact that it's like hotter than it was during the summer Is really killing my vibe like I'm not gonna lie okay here. They are ah finally my frickin faves these on the other hand They're fine They're cute But I don't like them as much So those are going in retirement for now my mom makes me leave on the TV for my dog when I live So as you can see we have the TV on here for the frickin dogs. I find that funny Let me know if you guys actually do that too because I don't know if that's like normal my mom literally makes me turn on the TV on like the highest volume for my dogs he says it it like Distracts them so that they don't like bark it outside stuff But you know what I think that's a little bit's s because they bark all the time anyway, so that's that okay? Let's go get some juice now Oh A little bit sad you know I'm a little bit sad because normally my order is size two vanilla with almond butter and chocolate sauce Sadly they ran out of chocolate sauce Am I sad yes, I'm talking so sad I got chocolate chips instead so like I think I'm gonna be okay but like I'm not sure it's just not the same you know I Mean like don't get me wrong, it's really good. I miss my job. It's awesome. Also on top of it She barely gave me any almond butter man No hard feelings they barely had any almond butter left what's going on anyway They barely had any almond butter so I only got a little bit of that too, but hey still tastes good. Oh My god, I forgot I was filming I'm gonna go in again and get another one but the judge Academy So I'm not going to this is the biggest size, and I always get through it like in two minutes I wish there was a way. I could make this at my house. I just had the very real realization that if I don't start driving home very soon I will hit extreme traffic's so oh sorry minivan didn't mean to move too slow for you, huh? Best song of all time It is the best song of all time if you know that song if if you if you wouldn't have more songs like that Check out mine That is so annoying you want to check out my playlist video check the links in the description of this video And you can find my playlist video where I show you all my favorite songs subscribe oh Good morning today to start out the vlog I'm going to uh Whoa whoa, whoa wow? This is unheard of for me I don't really get text messages so I got a few packages packages I got some kind of fun stuff So I thought I would show you guys what I got the company pin Lord I believe contacted me and was like hey. We want to send you some pins. I don't really like Brandi I don't really do brand deals like this isn't like a sponsorship or anything They just like sent them to me as a free gift And I thought they were so cute like just hold on a sec you're gonna get it Okay, this first pin says it says ice It's the only way that is the most me thing I have ever heard if you guys know me You know I love ice drinks and so when I saw this I was like oh my god This is meant to be this is like the best thing I've ever seen, but that's so cute And then I also got one that said death before Decaf because you know girl's gotta have her caffeine got one that said my god You suck because everyone freakin sucks, and I'm just kidding. This is probably the hardest thing. I've done all day well You can't see it's not focusing, but it's a cat pushing a coffee off the table, so they're basically all coffee related And I'm excited about it So thank you pin Lord for sending those to me speaking of pins shadow to a girl who made me literally homemade freakin pins So it's a Gucci one. This one's like a picture of me this one is a strawberry smoothie what I believe and that's like a coffee one with it also kinda has my face in it I Just think that these are super cool and shout out to you These are really no thanks, and they're homemade which is just ten times over. I love it next thing I got was from Etsy. I don't even remember what the shops name was but I can link that down below I want to start putting patches on stuff like patches like fabric patches on like denim Jack It's and like stuff like that cuz I think they're cute And so I found this one that said like runs with scissors on it And I think it's kind of funny because it's like you know I'm a rebellious Teen I run with scissors, so I thought it was kind of funny, so I got a few box know what this is oh? So this company sent me this camera to try out They said if you want to try it out you can it's basically like a GoPro, but like just like a ripoff GoPro I guess so I'll try this out at some point and let you guys know how it is because I think it's more affordable than A GoPro and I know a lot of people really want GoPros I'll try this out at some point and let you guys know if it's good. It's called an Aki of course I'm always honest with you guys It's not like I'm being paid to talk about that you guys know my vans are disgusting so bad like rips all over them They're so gross And I've had them for like a really long time, they're white vans I ordered new bands And they just came so let's talk about it slip on blue because I think these are really cute And I don't know I might return these depending on how much I like them, but think I would like them and then I got Lace-up checkered so that's that I'm pretty excited about that because I've needed new shoes for a long time And I think that those will be fun to style a little bit Different than my normal a little bit different than my slip-on white vans But I think it's fun or my hazards on I don't wanna turn them off where the fuck is it my car is much more Simple oh here it is okay My car is getting an oil change right now, so I have to drive my mom's car which is fine Cuz I actually like her car better so basically I ended up trying on my shoes and these ones hold on the checkered lace-up ones Freaking kidding me the checkered lace-up Ones are like fit really weird and like they aren't like what I thought they were online I'm gonna go return them and get different ones Going to the mall didn't really want to go to the mall today to be honest, but hey You know I got it got a roll with it, but yeah that's why you don't really like ordering online because they like if it was tried on ah Going the mall now so actually the person I got the call from was Reem, and she said hey meet me and Lily at Phil's not Phil's I wish we were going to Phil's me me and Lily at pressed which is where I went yesterday So guys know you gave me a okay, so we're going to press I'm gonna meet them there but for safe to return these shoes So I'm gonna running really fast and return them and maybe exchange them, but I would normally take the camera in and stuff But I'm so excited for press that I don't want to like waste any time and like honestly Do you really want to see like a montage of the vans? Or I don't think so I'm gonna leave my camera in the car and cover it with this towel So that nobody steals it because this is my baby, and I parked cherish this with my entire life in Seoul Okay just finished in the mall disappointed Huh not mad just disappointed because they didn't have my size in like any other shoe that I wanted I was like okay Can I try on these and they are like don't have your size? And then I like tried to try on all these unique colors and trying to like step outside of the box I didn't have my size in any of them and then finally I was like can I just have white vans Don't have my size not either. Oh wow they didn't freaking out my size and anything so for now I'm stuck with my ripped up white vans and These bad boys, but these are cool, and I'm excited about them, so I was little bit hesitant about these blue ones at first. I was like do I really like that It's you know. I think they're growing on me a little bit more now I'm going to go meet up with lily and Reem. We're gonna get some pressed juice, and I'm very Excited sorry, that's so annoying also quick update for people who saw the blog where I said, I'm trying to work there Haven't called me back starting to lose.

lllgEOoka8Q,why i left school,thank you for your constant love. you are some of the most amazing people i have ever encountered. i adore u all.,2017-10-26T21:28:15Z,347648,8874255,17814,"okay this video you know, i'm a little, i'm on edge okay, i'm a little bit on edge because I've kinda been putting this off i don't know. It's not like anything i've ever made before I'm like nervous but i really want  to tell you guys more about what's going on in my life, because there's a certain part of my life that i feel like I'm kind of hiding, from you guys. And, this isn't fucking clickbait. This isn't like some sort of like let me just get into it, i guess. so, this is kind of going to be a combination of the story of why I left school, combined with why i started my youtube channel. and it all kind of ties in together, and it's kind of just my story. I don't know. like, not my story of my whole life, this isn't like a draw my life here's kinda...what happened i guess let's start out with why i started my youtube channel So, i'm a junior in high school, right now. I'm 16. Junior in high school. blah blah blah okay, flash backwards to sophomore year. the end of the year, second semester. to put it in simple terms i was just having a shitty time like ass i maybe showed up to school 3 times a week i couldn't fucking do it. like i would just sit in class and i would just cry like i don't even know why. it wasn't my school's fault. it wasn't anyone's fault i just didn't like the environment i totally had too much on my plate. at this point i wasn't even doing youtube yet, mind you this was when i was literally just in school like that was my only like kind of thing that i was doing in my life towards the end of the year, I i had became severely depressed i couldn't go to school. I couldn't hang out with my friends i had completely cut off all my friends i didn't hang out on the weekends i didn't do anything. And it sucked. i mean it really fucking sucked. and of course, i'm pretty sure everyone's probably felt something close to it. whether it's in a very small or a very large kind of way second semester of sophomore year was probably one of the worst times i've had i didn't even come to the last day of school the last day of school was June first the day before that was May 30th right? i think. yeah. on May 30th i took my driver's test i failed. i was fucking so sad because to me getting my license was like this will give me a way to escape, ya know if i'm having a hard day if i'm feeling fucking depressed as hell and i just like want to have some time to myself if i just wanna like go and get food, by myself if i just want to like spend time by myself i felt like having my license was something that could give me that and so i was kinda connecting getting my drivers license with like having an escape from what i was going through so when i failed my test my depression immediately got worse I mean it was so bad like I literally couldn't get out of my bed thus I didn't go to school the last day, which was the last day of school so i was really upset and i ended up talking to my dad for like i don't know two and a half hours or something just about, like, what am i gonna do? like, i need something that can, like, help me escape from what i'm going through thus, i started my youtube channel. First video I posted was, like, a lookbook, or something. right. May 30th was such a f***king sh*ty day for me I was like, I need to like get my head out of this immediately I want to just like start a YouTube channel. I don't know why. I just wanted to do that. So then, the next day, I went to San Francisco with my dad He filmed the video for me next day I post it, it was up and all this began over the summer I was posting almost everyday. for a while there I was just like vlogging all my vacation I mean I was hardcore on that youtube grind like you best believe I loved it it was so great fully pulled me out of my depression 100 percent in the beginning there I didn't even care  who how many people like saw my video I didn't care about my views I didn't care about my subscribers I didn't, like, not that I didn't care about my subcribers But I didn't care about the number of subscribers I had I was just excited to be doing something new with my life like I was just excited to be starting a new journey with my life,  I guess it kinda gave me this feeling of hope that depression wasn't ruling my life I had something else that was making me happy, and that was YouTube and it still, to this day continues to do that for me and I'm eternally grateful, if that's even the right word to use fast-forward to the end of summer I kinda rekindled my friendships with some of friends and, I was kinda back to normal i wasn't depressed anymore i was almost fully outta that i wasn't.. i was really emotionally stable like, i could have a shitty ass day and like at the end of the day I would still be smiling, ya know it was good, i was really stable start school, junior year and i've always been somebody who is super into school if you will i really work hard at school i really put a lot of effort into school it's something that i've always prioritised as my number one thing that was like what i thought my future was i thought that my future was gonna like be determined by what my grades were etc. and that's why i put so much effort into it but for me, during this year, i started out and I, of course, i was taking a lot of AP's and I was taking a lot of honours and it was... it was a lot! and I quickly fell back into a very, very depressed state and it was very hard for me to film videos it was very hard for me to edit videos I remember there were multiple nights where I pulled all-nighters trying to be able to do youtube and school because for me youtube was what kept me... sane.. in a way so it was like for me, i would rather not sleep and get a video up because getting that video up is the only thing that gives me an ounce of happiness while being at school literally made me wanna die i started falling back into my old habits, i wasn't showing up to school I was late, like everyday sometimes i'd pull up to school, i'd be sitting in the car, and i'd be fucking balling my eyes out and I just couldn't go in, and I'd have to drive home I don't know exactly what it is about school and what about it made me so.. depressed! but... it was so bad! i would meet with my counsellor weekly, my school counsellor trying to find out a way that I could.. adjust my schedule trying to find a way that I could f- ya know trying to make my work load less impossible, and... it just was impossible. i could not cope with being at school it just got to the point where... it was simple! one morning I literally woke up and I was like 'I will never go to that school again' and I told my parents"
LMCemGAIvUg,THE BEST PB&J OF ALL TIME (I’M NOT KIDDING),not kidding,2017-10-24T20:49:10Z,116472,4012528,3752,"Oh hi Good afternoon vlog it's about 1:30. Just got out of the shower, had a slow morning, you know, it's Sunday I'm vlogging today because me and Lilly are gonna be doing a shoot for the gram I haven't done a shoot vlog in quite a while because I don't know we just haven't had the chance to shoot We've just all been busy. Been too long been like frickin two weeks, and that's too long for me so I'm putting on a face mask right now to just prepare my Skin for this outing and because I just think it is fun even though it probably doesn't do anything But we're you know what a girl can dream. Okay? This is the, if you're wondering, origins charcoal mask Whatever got my coffee right here of course. Don't worry guys. Don't freak out got a coffee right here Yeah, we're leaving at around four cuz we're going for like sunset. I have a while to like get ready and stuff I haven't picked out my outfits I Haven't blowdried my hair because I usually blow-dry my hair after I shower if I like want it to look good Cuz then it's like easy to manage You know I feel like if I just let my hair naturally dry. It's just not easy to manage It just gets all fluffy and f****** weird got to do my makeup got to pick out my outfits gotta upload a video Sundays! Oh I'm also hungry cuz it's about lunchtime. I woke up at actually a decent hour today woke up at about 9:00 That's pretty good. You know I mean I can easily sleep until 11 so 9 is like a respectable time I'm in the mood for peanut butter and jelly right now which is just so random cuz I like don't often crave that but like I make special peanut butter and Jelly, it's like deluxe like it's not like the normal shit You know it's like better like it's like really f****** good But it's like really specific like if you want to make this peanut butter and jelly like you have to get the exact Ingredients that I get or else it's just not the same when you think of peanut butter and jelly I bet you think about this Right, this is what you think of just like the basic thing that like everybody ate in like kindergarten That's not how I roll I like to take things to the next level with my peanut butter and jelly so now that I look like I'm at a spa Oh, also, this is my Turbie twist literally the most handy thing of all time. It's just f****** great I've had this since I was like maybe in seventh grade, but it still works like a charm. So excited I love peanut butter and jelly so fun. I should probably eat it more I don't really eat it that much peanut butter jelly time no oh he's very fat. Look at this little belly He's an indoor cat so he doesn't really get a lot of exercise, but we love him Anyways his name is Oliver, by the way he's the chillest cat of all time. I'm like serious He literally does not care like he just chills. He doesn't get angry he Never- oh my god That's cute like you can pick him up you can throw him around not that I do that I don't do that. I wouldn't do that to him, and he just doesn't care He's just so chill he loves to take naps with me You know who loves to get cat hair in my food who loves to get cat hair in my nose cat hair makes me sneeze When I sleep, it's okay, I don't mind But you know I'm kind of allergic to him not gonna lie like I'm literally ... Try not to sneeze right now because I'm like I'm kind of allergic to cats, but like I have two. I also have dogs But I'm not allergic to dogs, but literally I'm allergic to him, and he sleeps with me every night And I like wake up every morning with my eyes puffy because I get freakin like allergic reactions to his ass But what can you do you know you can't stop love time to blow-dry my hair. First we must brush obviously I'm a little bit violent with it, but it gets the job done I hate this. I look so weird. Time to blow-dry Just finished blow-drying my hair it looks a little bit fluffy But we're working with what we have. My face mask is so dry. I need to take it off immediately Librarian okay good. ugh Now that the face masks off. I take this- this is like the closest to a beauty view- beu- f*** This is like the closest to a beauty video you'll ever get from me next we're gonna using this simple micellar water  (or some shit) and just cleansing our face because if there's any left over like face mask. That's just like looks really bad That's all I'm doing for my makeup tutorial today. I hope you enjoyed and that's it Okay, my mom's um in the shower, so if you can hear that, I am so incredibly sorry, but today We're gonna be making some peanut butter and jelly So let's just hop right into it I'm so sorry. First you need peanut butter. Jelly. You need bread. But listen up and listen closely. I use very specific ingredients for a peanut butter and jelly it's not a joke This is not a drill. This is not something that I just joke around about okay This is this is big stuff for me, and so if you want to recreate this at home You have to be pretty exact or else it won't taste that good So we have this bread bread is probably the most flexible part of this You could use any bread as long as it's just like kind of like a hearty Wheat bread like not white flimsy gross-ass bread like you know that good stuff, okay? Let me just rant about bread for a second because you know I have to get something off my chest. See a lot of people Are like you know the healthier breads or like the breads with like more whole grains and s*** like ""oh that's gross"" White bread is not that good. I'm talking about like this white bread like something like sourdough or like a French like baguette or some s*** That's that's that's also white bread. That's good, but like original like PB&J bread like this It's just s*** it's so bad. A nice hearty wheat bread This is Alvarado Street Bakery sprouted flax seed bread from Trader Joe's you probably get it from Whole Foods and stuff, too Probably from your local grocery store, maybe maybe not if not don't worry You can be pretty flexible with this next we have peanut butter. I have Santa Cruz organics peanut butter This is the best peanut butter a close second would be Laura Scudders Which is also pretty good last the jelly this is crucial But if you don't have a Trader Joe's where you live you might be screwed. It's the organic super fruit jelly This is the best jelly of all time. I'm serious It's so good grape fuckin Welch's shit like it doesn't even stand it a chance We got the bread in the toaster right now And then you know we'll just keep these right here waiting for their big moment. Honestly, not gonna lie I'm a little bit hangry, but then again I'm always hangry so no one's surprised. gotta wait for this to toast and then we'll eat it Well, then we'll assemble it then we'll eat it. It's go time oh Yeah, baby plop that okay. I don't know why I just scared the f*ck out of me. Okay. It's time to assemble okay I know you can't see my face Which is very upsetting probably actually it's probably really nice. First step, of course, we put on peanut butter oh My god. This is this is a lot of work, but it's good. It's so good Now that your peanut butter has been applied onto both slices in a nice even layer Take your jelly take your jelly jelly take your jelly ew listen to that sound Jelly ASMR slap that on. I don't like that much jelly so I just put a little bit You're freakin done. Okay? I'm not gonna try it yet I'm gonna wait till I can taste test it for you guys even though I already know what it tastes like but whatever did I mention that this is open-faced? It's way better this way And you don't get like Overpowered by bread so overall I would recommend eating an open-faced like this 10 out of 10 11 out of 10 100 out of 10 Oh, yeah So good make it at home Normally, I pick out my outfit for my shoots like two days before or three days before and I'm like prepared you know but today I am just not prepared like we leave in literally an hour and 20 minutes from now And I just have not even thought about it like I just don't even know what I want to wear. Maybe I have a bunch of unfolded laundry right here, so maybe there's something good in this pile Maybe I don't know I don't know this is my first outfit. We have this top from brandy. That's like I don't know some sort of like racecar shirt these pants from PacSun these are literally my favorite jeans. I wear them all the time. I'm gonna wear my white Vans That are a mess But I know you might be like Emma that outfit is So boring like what like why is that outfit so boring you need to spice it up Yeah, Wow we have checkered, and then we have like checkered found one outfit now I need to find another one because even though I usually only end up wearing one outfit I like to bring two just in case. I picked out my next outfit, and I'm like low-key really into it This is not something I would've normally picked out But let me explain so we have the same jeans cuz changing pants in the car is annoying and then this shirt from Brandy I'm really digging it It's like short sleeve like short like lumberjack flannel looking ass thing And I just I'm wow like I really like this shirt And then my necklaces are from stargaze jewelry and these glasses are from Amazon I don't know they just match the outfit like I don't ever wear these I literally had them when I was Napoleon Dynamite for Halloween, but they're coming in handy It's one of those things where it's like You don't know if it's gonna be ugly or not until it's like too late. Lily is here bow bow bow *gasping for air because running is hard* So how was your day? Okay, I've personally never been to this spot. Have you? - No. So this will be a little adventure for us both. I look like a fucking lumberjack nerd Pee your pants pee your pants I ended up changing into this outfit once again And I'm going to start out with this one and then when the Sun starts going down. I'm changing into the other outfit. I I used to think oh That was so bad. Not wearing makeup today for this shoot because do you know what I don't wear makeup on the youtubes so why should I? Wear makeup on the instagrams. I'm just trying to keep it real out here squad. Oh my god That's so annoying. You know what song would be fitting for this cuz I'm on top of the world I Thought the view was pretty but I thought she was prettier Hey Two things number one we saw real-life coyote It looked like a dog, but we're like no that can't be and it was a freaking coyote If we don't make it out here alive That's why the coyote freaking got us We're taking a little break because you know shooting is hard work Instagram life hard work boy I'm so hungry. -Me too. Also. I have a zit on my lip and it's so painful - C'mon - I can see your whole boob - This should not be that hard Hey! Wow It's becoming nighttime, we're wrapping it up. We're dipping. We're leaving. I think we got some good ones There's a beautiful beautiful sunset, but sadly I didn't film it you'll get to see a photo of it. That's fine also I changed my shirt in public just like took off my entire shirt in public and changed Hopefully nobody saw me that was it a little quick shoot normally We do longer ones, but you know we're busy people we have to fit them into our schedule That was so cool Bye Lily! I love you so freakin much BAE I fucking love you the feeling is like so not mutual and it's so obvious Okay, Lily. Can't wait to see the pics gonna be great going to be lit, and I'll see you soon Okay, I'll see you soon. Sleep tight and don't let your mother f*ckin bedbugs bite Bye You guys know the drill by now.

haWBpJhP3ns,GOING BLONDE?,blonde emma is back baby,2017-10-22T21:01:09Z,59478,1695432,1929,"What's up guys this vlog is super spontaneous. It's like probably the most spontaneous of all. It's about 1:30 I just spent the entire morning editing and while I was editing my video I was like watching myself of course cause when you freaking film yourself You're watching yourself And I was like, ""you know what girl, you need to get your roots done. your hair is looking a little bit sh***y."" Yeah, after editing that entire video, just absolutely despising my hair. I was like do you know what? I need to go get my roots redone I get my hair lightened, kind of highlighted, but like kind of a little bit more than highlights I've been doing that since like eighth grade. I like to have my hair a little bit blonder I really honestly I go to a different salon like every time like I never go to the same one for some reason I just like don't have any reason to so I called a new salon that had super good reviews that I've never been to and I was like you know I want to set up an appointment or whatever and then they're like yeah We have one today at 2:00 I was like whoa whoa whoa whoa it's one o'clock like you want me to come in at 2:00, and she's like yeah Like you want to come in at two and I'm like do you know what f*** it, let's go and I was gonna run and get a coffee first But I literally have 30 minutes to get there and like get situated so I think it's really a better idea if I don't Get a coffee. Let me just show you what I'm going for here Before I like you know... so I like this, and that but for some odd reason Like they never exactly get it right, so it's always a little bit too dark Which is so annoying? so I hope this time that they don't f*ck it up basically. maybe, I think it's cuz I'm maybe asking for the wrong thing and then like They just like don't you know no one does it right because I'm not asking for the right thing It's now 4:30 so it took about two and a half hours, which is not too bad I've had experiences where I literally took four hours for them to do my hair. It looks good I'm happy with how it turned out very spontaneous though It's like 4:30, and now I'm like kind of unsure what I should do. I just love having my hair done it's just one of those things in life that I like I used to be somebody who you see my nails done like all the time like constantly had acrylics 24/7 but you know those days are over. I'm not really about that life anymore also I'm good always nervous before I get my hair done because I go to like a new lady every time because I just like to Try new places because you never know there's so many hair salons in this world I don't want to just stick to what but I'm happy cuz she was good She's obviously been in the business for a long time because we're like you know she's been like doing here for a while because it Was so funny like she finished washing my hair And then like she gave me the brush and she's like can you brush your hair for me? I was like Sure, she was like made me brush my own hair for her which is fine But it was interesting like that's like a bold move. You know in a hair salon You don't always expect that but hey, you know what I don't judge now. I'm gonna go get some food So I thought about it for a little bit, and I decided that I'm gonna go get pressed juice And I'm freaking excited about it go ahead I am continuously nice I am continuously doing things to benefit our community such as letting the pedestrians go I'm a fan You know honestly? I'm new to the press juice plays and I'm gonna get a pressed freeze if you don't know what that is I don't know what to tell you it's like vegan frozen yogurt basically made out of like frozen juice okay? And you can get it at the press juicer E. Which is a pressed juice place and actually fun fact? I'm actually trying to get a jump You're moving fun fact of actually trying to get a job at the pressed juice place They looked over my resume, and they liked what they saw only problem is they haven't called me They said they want to do a phone interview, and I'm like bro. Hook me up. Let's do this shit so far They haven't called me for the interview that could either be because they decided that they don't like me or Because they just haven't gotten a chance to call me back yet. It's really it Really go either way, so wish me luck with that even though. I don't work there yet I'm still gonna go and get it pressed juice fries right now, and I'm pretty pumped about it What the fuck okay, I'm so relieved that I got my freakin hair done It just feels so good blow game is important. Not really though. It doesn't really matter but for me You know it makes a difference my hair gets oily really fast And it didn't always used to be like that I get out of the shower My hair dries and then like an hour later. My hair is already oily. It's so annoying It's I don't know why that's been my life. Lately, which is annoying. What can you do you know? What can you do so I'll let you know when I get there, and we can chow down together. Oh, that's gross I'm never saying that again. Oh my god I'm peeing my pants this looks so good and you're wondering when I get I get the vanilla with almond butter and chocolate on it On it. I'm gonna eat it now. Okay. Bye So I finished my press tooth freeze thing it was so freaking good. I love it possibly my favorite food. It's so good I don't know Maybe it's just a phase. I tend to have phases with foods where it gets super obsessed with them six months later I like don't really give a fuck about it anymore, and I think maybe that's what's happening, but I don't know I don't think I would ever not like this. It's just so good. It's kind of chilly Maybe it's because my AC is on I'm so stupid. I'm hungry, baby I'll just go home and be a good citizen and make food at my own house You know oh this person is not allowed to be crossing the street right now You are not by any means allowed to cross the street right now. Ma'am anyways well I'm excited to get home now, so I can make that because I'm so freakin hungry There's a lot of traffic too, so it's okay. I'm just not gonna complain. Oh, I don't like when I Drive this next two trucks I didn't realize that's gonna be driving home during a very very traffic each time, and I'm really a minute You know or really we're dealing with it. It's it's not it's not easy, but I'm excited though when I get home I'm to make some pasta. That's made out of garbanzo bean flour and you might be like Emma That's so weird, and it is weird, but it tastes like regular pasta it's just made out of garbanzo bean flour which is like better for you because it has like a lot of protein in it and I'm a vegetarian so I need to get protein anywhere. I can get it though I'm really excited about it, but in this traffic So what can you do you know what I mean, you gotta just surrender to it But just listening to some jams you know which is nice but I'm just Frustrated because I'm hungry And I also just don't like traffic like I don't know if I could ever move to LA I want to move to LA one day in my life of course at least once just good I think everybody does you know but literally I heard the traffic There is so bad like I don't know if I could deal with that cuz traffic gives me major anxiety enough with my rambling Okay, it started. There is no movement like at all like no movement at all we're just sitting here completely stationary and guess what I'm hungry I Don't know why that guy just gave me a thumbs up That's so weird I tried to like take a detour so that I could like get home faster, and it just like did not work And I am so stressed. I think the date. I'm mostly just hungry, so I think it'll end up being okay well I'll vlog if anything else interesting. I have involved in the car, but hopefully next time I see you. I'll be eating I don't know if you can tell but a storm is a brewing out there a brewing. Oh my god There's a stove it isn't I remember that a storm is brewing us It's still embarrassing. I said that but a storms brewing and I live in freakin, California where like for us like rain is super rare Buck-buck I missed my exit, and it was right there Okay, anyway Sorry about that Basically what I was trying to say was before I miss my exit because I was distracted because I was freaking drying a vlog storm Is coming and it's gonna rain and get stormy and that's like so rare for this area So I'm like really excited because I actually really like rain as long as I don't need to be doing anything outside then I love It update another like literal 40 minutes has passed, and I'm finally on the freeway Thank God nothing has changed still hungry still waiting in traffic Still pissed off almost at a mental breakdown actually at one point because I was so fucking pissed it literally took me 40 minutes to get on the freeway because well after I missed my Say I had to like wait and even more traffic to get back on the freeway But you know what I'm not. I'm gonna try not to be negative here because I managed I'm here now soon I will be eating my pasta. I just wish that that time was right now, but I have to understand You know you can't get everything you want sometimes. You just struggle for things and work for things right now I'm working for my pasta I bet my pastas gonna taste 10 times better now that I had to wait in this traffic for it You know what I mean like I earned that Hopefully now the next time I talk to you. I will be eating pasta making pasta I can only pray that that will be the next clip. Oh my god. I Am home. I think this is the best moment of my life This is the pasta I'm gonna be making this afternoon slipper in bonza or some it's pretty good If you've never made pasta before this is how you do it get a pot and fill it up a certain amount Turn on your stove and boil the water take some Salt and put it in there cuz I don't know why you're just supposed to do that I guess and then you wait So I'll get back to you when umm things get more exciting because now I just have to sit down on my ass and wait See that no that's not vape oh yeah, baby. Don't forget You know turn down the heat a little bit because you're not trying to overflow in here If you're wondering what my topping of choice is I like this organic whole foods pizza sauce not Marinara, sauce not tomato sauce pizza sauce it's very different. I'm really picky eater I guess and this is just overall perfect. It. Just has the perfect flavor It's so beautiful, and I just can love it of course I have to have a drink as well with my dinner right. I can't drink coffee at this hour because it is 7:30 p.m. And that's a little bit. You know a little bit too late I don't wanna be hyped up at night, so I'll show you the drink that I drink when it's nighttime first We have ice one of these Lacroix. Which is like basically just sparkling water or that year I Just realized. I don't even think I had a coffee when I was during this video so far in this video I don't think I've had a coffee yet, which is absolutely unheard of if I continue this vlog into tomorrow as well Then you'll definitely get a coffee We'll see last thing I do hi is I add two of these true lime packets which are basically just powdered lime just like citric acid and lime flavoring and Reason why I use these instead of like a regular lime It's just because like buying a bunch of limes all the time is so much work and having these little packets around that just taste Exactly the same is good, and they're not like weird. They don't have added preservatives Involved they probably do actually I just am Not sure that's my nighttime drink of choice Not as good as coffee, but it does a trick one minute the kitchen the tension is high in the kitchen Oh, I almost forgot hacked out my strainer. You know so I can strain the pasta big things going on here I'm absolutely ecstatic whoa oh yeah, baby What? We have the sauce here add it to the sauce pastas flying. Oh, I made way too much Oh, oh, I just burned myself. Okay. Let me mix it up Wow. This is so beautiful I went for a run yesterday and all my joints are super sore and so when you feel like that Supposedly you're supposed to eat a bunch of carbs so that's when pastas just really comes in handy You know because I never go on runs, and so I really need this okay boss No, I mean. I'm I'm so excited about it now. It's so weird there's the pasta and kind of looks gross because like I'm The sauce is like all over it and like all over the bowl cuz it's a mess cuz I'm a mess I'm gonna eat this now Good morning I'm not like tired, but I'm tired sometimes You just have to get up and just start getting going like I didn't even eat breakfast this morning I was like you know I stay to get my ass up and just like start my day I get a lot of enjoyment out of going places to get coffee food. It's just what makes me happy and smile Oh it rained whoa Huh that's a rare occurrence in California, anyways, I might get pressed used again, but that's really bad I got yesterday if I now have it for breakfast. I don't know that's kind of bad, but it's so good There's gonna be traffic like there was yesterday because as you know yesterday was quite traumatic when I came to traffic It would have normally taken me 20 minutes to get home at most and it took me 2 hours. I Don't know I don't know what it is about me But I think I kind of like Subconsciously make trips 10 times longer like just driving trips 10 times longer because I make so many mistakes Like I missed so many exits, and then I miss another ax8 and then you know Siri reroutes me And I get confused and the next thing you know it's been two hours, and I'm still not home I'm popular Face it six kid take it take a sip of my secret potion Was that do you ever like wake up in the morning and you start driving you're like holy I'm not ready for this like I'm still not awake enough for this take a sip of my secret potion first someone I don't know the words dang it. I think I'm gonna go depressed which is the same place? I went to yesterday and get another frozen yogurt. You know what I really shouldn't though. Okay. Do you not? I'm not gonna go I'm gonna go to Phil's which is my usual spot that I edit at actually because it's a really nice vibe in there You know it's close to this school Sanford Sanford is a really smart college that I could never get into is in Palo Alto California if you kidnap me man I'll do karate moves on you and like you'll be doomed so don't even try. I like that area a lot go there all the time even though it's like not that close to where I live I go there all the time because Everybody it's like hanging out around there goes to Stanford, and so they're all just like smart little students something about it It's just like a good vibe like when you're in a cafe with a bunch of Stanford students You're in there, and you're working hard, and they're working hard The only difference is that you're working hard on editing a YouTube video And they're working hard on like coming out with like you know a cure for multiple diseases Quit and I stay out so I decided I would sit outside Okay, I think I'm not ending today's vlog if you liked it give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel Oh, my god. People are coming up a little anything you want I love you all so much and appreciate every single one of you okay, and I can't wait to see you next time"
MEDgI4dIrc4,i made brownies because i had a bad day,i ate the rest of these brownies for breakfast this morning and i feel so gross but they r delish so its ok ill let it slide,2017-10-20T00:37:14Z,149289,4595580,4389,"Honestly I'm having a shitty day, and I just need to eat my feelings What's up, guys and welcome back to another installment of cooking with Emma I love these because it gives me like an excuse to like bake stuff And then I can eat it for like the next day and a half because I finish it all in like one day I tend To do these when I'm having a shitty day, and I just want to eat my feelings today's one of those days You know it's just not my day I decided you know what let's just express ourselves through baking and make some healthy brownies I went on Pinterest per usual, and I found a recipe for some brownies, and we're gonna make them today. Let's gather the ingredients Where's the almond flour Ow Is my hair fluffy mess yes my hair. I've just been having like a constant bad hair day or day for like a week I just can't get it to do what I wanted to do like it. Just looks like ass every single day It's just been so upsetting putting it in a bun today I know you're like sick of seeing my hair in a bun cuz I look like really bad with my hair's in a bun but Like you know what we're just were our selves on this channel We don't try to be cute who cares we're speaking brownies today. This isn't a fashion show motherfuckers, okay We've gathered our ingredients, and it's time to big it get down into it Grease an 8 by 4 loaf pan with coconut oil, okay? Holy shit, okay, this is no, this is Okay, this one's gonna have to do even though. It's not 8 by 4. It's 8 by 7 Hopefully this doesn't fck it all up. I don't know I mean I'm usually somebody likes to keep things exact but not today Pretty sure I can put this in the oven but Possibly not and that would be very upsetting if I like you know catch my house on fire because that's not supposed to go in The oven but we'll find out I'm so bad at opening jars and such so my mom literally has this jar opener thing and it works wonders every time literally Okay, I think this is a good way of doing this I don't know some of you have this feels kind of wrong But I hope that this works We'll see we'll see. pan is oiled and greased We would be sending that to the slide, side, setting that to the side Oh, oh, oh, I almost forgot to get my measuring spoons I swear iv'e been cooking with Emma videos way too much But I just love cooking you know it really allows me to express myself And show who I really am through my baking I think it's really valuable for me to uh you know find a way to express myself Because I'm a very expressive person first We're adding some almond flour so for all you couldn't gluten free for all you Guten free this recipe is gluten free I repeat it is gluten free and it's healthier because it's made with almond flour and that's good for you so you're welcome for that next we're adding cocoa powder because you know this is frickin brownies I Just powdered it and it fluffed everywhere Okay, I think we're fine this recipe calls for baking powder and baking soda, so that's fucking odd it's okay Honestly, I feel like they usually do either one or the other you know you don't ever have a recipe that has both baking powder And soda, so I'm a little bit iffy about this recipe maybe it's weird Maybe it's not we'll soon find out does anybody know what the difference between baking powder or baking soda is please Let me know in the comments because I don't want to google it oh the salt just spilled everywhere Okay, perfect BAE perfect today, but now I have salt everywhere it spilled. It spills it spills everywhere every time okay now I have to mix. Let's see do we have a whisk in this house. I don't remember. Oh hell yeah boy. Oh my god I have a mini whisk and a regular side wait a minute whisk in a regular-sized whisk so this one's perfect for mix Mixing dry ingredients. I am so excited about this right now. Oh my god. This is so frigging cute. Oh I just coughed all over it luckily I'm the only one who's gonna be eating these Oven is preheated, baby coconut oil, baby healthy for you Actually it probably isn't but I don't know I've read mixed reviews some people Say coconut oil is a very good food for you other people say it's horrible for you Don't leave your opinions in the comments down below. I'm not trying to start arguments, okay Oh my god, a half cup of almond butter. Holy shit I don't know whether I like almond butter or peanut butter batter because they're both really quality butters You know I like peanut butter and almond butter with anything like I'll eat both of them with anything But the thing is almond butter is so expensive like I was at the store brand Justin's sells their almond butter for like $20 per jar I get it almonds are expensive to make because they use so much freakin water to grow so i get it like it makes sense But it's just I don't know it's a little out of proportion when you can just get peanut butter But at the same time almond butter is truly a beautiful butter. It's just a lot of choosing. That was so stupid I don't know why I went on the tangent with that, but anyway. Oh whoa that's like fuckin lava, baby That's like half of a jar that's like ten dollars worth of freaking almond butter, but okay wow this looks actually hella good now I'm getting excited about this. I mean I've always been excited about this, but like the closer I'm getting to the final product the more excited. I'm getting I'm having a little bit of anxiety here. Let me explain to you Why the recipe calls for a five by eight pan right? This is like an 8 by 8? I'm stressed because I feel like I'm gonna like put it all in here, and it's gonna spread out too thin So you think I'm gonna put it into like See I have this right here right um So I think I'm actually gonna do it with this instead so I kinda have to backtrack a little bit now do you know what so glad that I thought about this before because it would have been really really a Disappointment if I would have used that other pan and the brownies would have been extremely flat and dry so We'll see how that goes but back to our regular scheduled cooking video what the fuc- I'm the one that's up for like 30 seconds It's very important to warm up stuff in smaller increments so that you don't burn your materials You're welcome. This is such a mess this is the best almond milk of all time It's the newborn vanilla almond milk ten out of ten to would bang so good it is delish I use it in all of my coffees if you're vegan and you want to make this recipe don't worry I'm pretty sure this recipe is vegan this recipe is vegan this recipe is vegan so You're vegan go freaking ham on this two tablespoons of maple syrup down the freakin hatchet maple syrup is the vegan sweetener of choice I think you can also use agave if you want completely up to you because those are both vegan because they didn't come from Any animal nipples coconut sugar great on oatmeal? I'm just freakin throwing out the freakin tips right now, but I'm serious Oh, I'm gonna use my mini whisk where's my mini whisk? Vanilla extract down the hatchet. I don't know why I keep saying that last ingredient is applesauce. I can't open the shit Okay, I like no joke don't even know what apple sauce tastes like I haven't eaten it since like preschool So I'm gonna try a little bit before I put it in this Wow this is actually it's kind of good Wow now I mix all of this together with my mini whisk try and tell me That's not adorable you can't cuz you'd be lying while that looks absolutely stunning so it's kind of like shit But that's like not like shit. I mean like actual shit. I'm going ham today, and I'm freaking I'm getting all of this out I'm spatulaing the fuck out of this because I want to make sure none gets left behind you feel me okay now I'm just mixing this all together with the mini whisk back at it again with the mini whisk love it. It's all mixed Let me do a little batter taste test because in my opinion the flavor of the batter is almost more important than the actual flavor of the Brownies well that is good actually tastes like good quality It just tastes like home tastes like Barefoot Contessa So just welcomed you inside of her home and just freakin shove that down your throat. You know I almost forgot These are chocolate chunk brownies if you watched my mediocre vegan cookie video I'll link that down below. If you haven't seen it as you would know if you watch that video I think that chocolate chips are overrated. I think that they've been used too many times, and it's just the easy way out I'm personally a fan of the Chocolate Chunk And I always go out of my way to Just pick up a chocolate bar instead of the little pre-made chocolate chips Also to keep this recipe on the vegan trend this is vegan This is vegan chocolate so do not cut my head off in the comments by saying chocolate isn't vegan Emma Well this one is so shut up this recipes vegan it only calls for 1/4 cup of freaking chocolate chips That's like really not a lot I don't never gonna feel about that, but it's really a satisfying feeling when you slice through that chocolate You know it just has a satisfying sound like just listen to that I should do some ASMR chocolate cutting video I bet I'd get millions of views on that but I'm not gonna do it I don't even gonna measure it mix it up fold actually as the recipe says fold in your chocolate chips don't mix fold That's hella good I Really don't know how much to add to each one. I'm pretty sure that brownies Don't rise very much, so I'm just gonna kind of be generous with it cuz I don't think they're gonna like overflow But honestly, I really don't know where the fuck is my spatula. We're the fuck is it. I'm serious show yourself Are you kidding me spatula am I missing something? I don't understand like is it like here and i just can't see it. Oh Found it the thing with me is my the recipe never goes exactly as planned. That's what makes this all fun It's just a little bit of a little bit of risk a little bit of mystery in there You don't really know if it's gonna turn out good because you're kind of not following the rules But if it does turn out good. It just shows how much of a savage you are Hmmm that batter tastes so fucking good Mmm. I think it's I'm going to pop these in the oven 10 to 15 minutes. Let's do this It's gonna be hard. It's not gonna. Be easy but we have to wait for 10 to 15 minutes for these bad boys to cook and then after that we have to wait for another 20 minutes before we can even cut into them cut into them. It's not gonna. Be easy, but it's gonna be worth it. I hope They've been cooling and it's time to consume them there's a cat hair in this one Okay, that's fine. I mean I waited 20 minutes for them to cool, but apparently I maybe made a mistake That's good, I told myself I'd only eat one but that's not gonna happen I'm gonna end this video because I want to eat these I would say if you wanna make this recipe it's actually really good very chocolatey not too sweet and not that bad for you, so you're not going to get Diseases if you eat this it's all stuck in my throat That was it for today's video if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want I love you all so much. I appreciate every single last one of you, and I'll see you next time"
DkDy1R5l8vY,i lowkey crashed into someones car (plz don’t tell my mom),i wasnt even kidding tho...,2017-10-17T22:30:15Z,120174,4277384,3370,"*clanking* sorry   Just a little something for the road What's up guys okay I need to turn on the AC What's up guys. I'm super excited for today's vlog because  I'm taking you on an adventure with me So basically I live like 30 minutes away from San Fransisco and every time I go to San Francisco I always go with someone else like I've never-I never go alone or I never Ya know I don't really branch out when it comes to stuff like that I don't know like it's a big city I guess kind of intimidating could be potentially dangerous I guess if you're like young ya know I don't know now I have my liscence I go places alone all the time and I'm alone most of the time So I was like ya know what I'm just going to go the city today and have a nice little day to myself kinda like a little date with me I've never had to deal with all the parking and all the traffic and stuff like that I've never had to do any of that so we'll see how it goes I'm gonna go to the sunset district first and then after that I'm going the the haight which is like a famous area because they have really good thrift stores there and I wanna go thrifting a little bit it's gonna be great I don't even know like how to get to San Fransisco like I've been there no joke 400 times and I still don't know how to get there I don't know where I want to go first I'm kinda hungry so should I get food see this is the thing when you go places alone its so up to you its like whatever you wanna do but then that mean you gotta make all the decisions on your own so I don't know I think I'm gonna get food I'm hungry ya know what I'm hungry I just yelp everything I'm a huge yelper I never like leave reviews or anything but I yelp all the time I am the yelp queen like when my friends are like we're in a new area we've never been to where should we eat I'm like everyone shut up let me yelp for like 5 minutes I will find us the most artsy place you've ever seen that is my skill in life I think I'm going to go to this place called Judohlicious or something cause it's like really good vegan food I'm gonna drive to the city now and focus cause I don't wanna fucking crash okay it's literally been like an hour and a half since I've talked to you last that was lowkey traumatic literally I missed my exit 4 times and then got like super lost and then like siri was confused imaps was confused we were all confused it literally was supposed to take me 40 minutes to get here it took me like an hour and a half but I am stupid so it took me literally 40 minutes to find parking every time I'd see a spot it would be on the wrong side of the rode so it's like I can't park there it was a little bit it was a little bit it was a lot okay I'm literally wearing all black and it is so hot out since when is it ever hot in San Fransisco ever it's always so frickin cold the one day I decide to wear all black it's frickin hot but ya know what I'm not complaining though cause it's a pretty nice day but I really have to pee and I also didn't realize how far away I parked like I genuinely parked so far away ya know what I'm gonna stop complaining I'm excited for my food that's more positive that's more positive thankyou so much of course I had to get a coffee this coffee super small right so small iced almond milk latte 6 dollars for this this is the smallest iced latte I've ever had and it was 6 dollars I mean and it's good it's not the best I've had 6 dollars 6 dollars for this yea I'm a little salty the cup is hella cute so it's like whatever I'll let it slide this time I'm pretty sure this is the best weather I've ever felt in San Francisco in my entire life it's so comfortable I mean it's warm it's very warm I'm sweating a little bit but it's so comfortable I'm very happy about it I didn't mix this coffee because they ran out of straws and stuff to stir with so now it's like I drank all the almond milk off the top and now it's just straight up esspresso cause I didn't mix it cause I'm stupid so it's super strong and I like can't drink it okay I don't know if you can see but it has like weird like chuncks like of like white and I'm pretty sure that that's the almond milk but I can't tell or like the almond milk remnants anyways I don't know what that is but I'm honestly not gonna question it because it was 6 dollars meaning that the quality of it must be good or something about it I don't know also I'm walking back to the car but I don't know where I parked I look horrible I'm ready to go to our next place I think I'm gonna go to haight street next drop in some thrift stores see what they have to offer they also have just like cool shops anyways thrifting in the city is super expensive like they jack up all the prices because they know like the hipsters are like willing to pay big prices like a pair of levi's is like 60 bucks whereas at like goodwill near where I live you can get them for like 5 but it's still fun because it's already like picked through it's like you don't have to do the digging yourself like they've already done the digging so they have all the best stuff there so that's why it's probably more expensive that is why it's more expensive there's a really great coffee shop around here that I really love like probably one of my favorites it's called Andy Town I don't know if I wanna go cause it's like I just got this 6 dollar coffee so do I really wanna go spend another like 5 on another coffee I don't know also I'm a little bit jazzed up on caffeine if you can't tell by the speed of my talking cause I had 2 at home and then I just got another one and they were all caffeinated so I'm a little bit on x-games mode you know when you eat certain foods at a restaurant you love the food while you're eating it but once you're done you're like I feel like ass right now like this was the kinda food where it's like you eat it and then afterwards you're like yeah I fuckin feel great so that was good if you're in the city I recommend Judohlicious this is also a really cute area of the city it's the sunset area it's just so cute and like it's not that crowded I mean it's hard to find parking but it's not that crowded and everybody is just like super chill omygod okay something kinda crazy just happened so I'm on my way to the haight right now parking in this area is absolute hell like so bad I mean it's so incredibly busy I've literally been searching for parking for 40 minutes not an exaggeration wait I need to turn my maps on because I'm so fucking confused I finally found a parking spot and I was like pumped I was pulling into the spot they were parked so badly and I am also stupid I accidentally tapped their bumper while I was trying to parallel park if you drive you've probably done this a million times I know I know I've done it a million times  also people have done it to me and left huge dents on my car and like never left a note which is nice basically I accidentally tapped this persons bumper super lightly I mean it was like very lightly their frickin car alarm goes off and I'm like fuck do you know what I bet I just fuckin left a huge dent this one must be bad ya know I'm in the car I'm fucking pissing my pants but mind you I still haven't even parked yet like I don't know it was just a really tight tight tight tight spot freaking the fuck out I'm so freaked out okay I go outside of the car I look at the car no scrapes no bumps nothing I was like today is the day this is the best day of my life this is the best day of my life I was so scared I was like you know what today was a good day today was a good day and then like I fucking crash into somebody else's car and I'm like well day's ruined but guess what it's not omygod this is the steepest street I have ever seen holy shit oh my fucking god omygod is this even safe omygod I feel seasick that literally gave me a panic attack that was so fuckin scary still looking for fucking parking it's been almost an hour now holy shit I think those are spots nope all red this is hard bro this is frickin hard I'm a little anxious ya know well I also had a lot of caffeine it's it's really bad because I always get into a lot of high anxiety situations after I've had extreme amounts of caffine and so then it's just like stupid because it's like I just set myself up for failure ya know what I mean I can't go people are so rude though too like I did not anticipate that everybody just fricken get's mad all the time we're all just trying to get through the day people why is everybody honking at one another let's all be nice let's all be friends okay I don't understand I kinda want to give up a little bit I really do I kinda just wanna go home but I wanna keep going I don't want to give up I don't I got this far ya know it's like why give up now wow people jaywalking everywhere like they frickin own the place go ahead I'm so nice letting the pedestrians go like a real savage of course I hate pedestrians they don't respect me I'm so afraid of buses I always feel like they're gonna hit me I alway-I don't know okay are you kidding me prius that is so rude I don't want to hear it siri tell me where the nearest parking spot is siri then we can talk ugh see this is making me irritable people are so rude I'm so sensitive holy shit oh no that's a fucking driveway driveway, driveway mhm awesome driveway okay perfects this is perfect omygod that guy saw me just fucking wheezing don't siri shut up honestly maybe in this remote little fuckin street maybe but probably not maybe though I think this is a spot omygod this is what happens when you don't give up you find a spot biach I think that's a winner success I fucking found parking I literally can't believe this okay well let's go now now that we've done that okay omygod this is so ugly I need it It's like this little button up okay I'm getting this okay these black denim shorts are really cute I'm not getting them because it's literally winter and that's just stupid the only thing I'm getting is this but I'm so in love with it this has been fun but I need to go home it's been an emotional rollercoaster when I just walked past that little girl she was like oo you're scary don't know what that's supposed to mean but I should probably do a little haul even though I like already showed what I got when I was in the store I got a few other things besides that one like button up kind of grandma looking let me show you what I got when I first saw it I was like this is probably ugly but I fucking love it and I'm so pumped like it can be dressed in so many different ways and I just am pumped about it next thing this is from the store that I could not film in and I got this New York shirt it was kind of expensive it was like 40 bucks which is stupid but like it's genuinely vintage it's not just like thrifted it's like vintage which is they sometimes rack up the prices when it comes to stuff like that eh I don't know I just kind of like it okay the last thing I bought I'm so pissed about I spent 10 dollars on this fucking shirt okay let me explain myself okay when I first looked at this I thought that i was a polo Ralph lauren shirt but it's a fucking abrocrombie shirt it's an abrocrombie shirt I spent 10 dollars on a used abrocrombie shirt I have like 500 of those from literally eighth grade I don't know I'll just sleep in this or something I'm pissed though because I thought it was going to be like an oversize Ralph Lauren T-shirt and I was pumped about it but it's not so that is annoying but that is my haul that's what I got I'm leaving the city now I actually had a very good day I loved it but I was a little bit stressed a few time I definitely had a few panic attacks not really not actual panic attacks but I got kinda anxious a few time because the busyness stressed me the fuck out but do you know what we made it through we made it out alive I'm so excited to go home and lay down I'm kinda sad I don't want to say goodbye to the vlog I wanna keep vlogging forever   but that was it for today's vlog if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel, comment down below anything you want I'm trying to think if there's anything else  "

What is up guys, welcome to today's vlog. Today, I'm gonna be vlogging my errands. yay. Because vlogging errands is kind of boring and I don't want you guys to get bored, I'm gonna be showing you guys some of my favorite songs right now, the songs that really spice up my playlist, you know? So it's kind of gonna be like a playlist video But it's also just gonna be, basically, a vlog - what is that person doing? That is not how you parallel park. For my errands that I have to run today, the first one I have to do is go to the Apple Store. So I'm having issues with my keyboard on my laptop, so I have to bring my laptop into the Apple Store. Basically my keys on my computer kinda jammed, so like when I try to type and they don't like just go. They're jammed. Does that make sense? I have to go in and ask if they can fix that. Because that's really fucking annoying and I'm not a fan of it. After that, I actually don't really have any other errands to run so that's probably just gonna be it for me. But we can just do other stuff together that aren't errands, just unnecessary activities. My aux cord in my car, it's kind of fucked up, and it like only works in half of the car. I have to like hold it weird, so that it'll like play the music in both sides of the car. And then it like, goes in and out and it's so annoying. So let's just jump into my songs that I like. This song's weird, but it's cute, so just go with it, okay? Oh f*ck, it's go time. It's good, it gets good right now. oohhh Okay next, oh, this is a good one. It's a good -- It's an oldie. It's a goodie... I've listened to the song for like my entire life Here it is. Kinda makes me cry a little bit not gonna lie, People definitely can see me lip singing and i'm very emb -- ""syncing""? ""lip-syncing""? And I'm embarrassed. Ahh!! this is my favorite f*cking song right now. I am in love with this song, oh my god! oh my god! Oh my god! It's so good! So f*cking good Literally I could listen to this song for my entire life, it's so good. Please, listen to it like ten times. And I can guarantee, you'll be in love with it. You just have to listen to it a few times, then you'll love it. This -- I've loved this song for like my entire life, and it never gets old. I've literally liked this song for like a year and a half. It's about to get so f*cking good up in here. Prepare yourself. I was too into my music and I accidentally got into a turn lane And now I have to turn left, and I don't need to turn left. So, that's really bad, but okay, here we are, okay. This is great. I love this. I f*cking love this song. What an oldie, you know? What a goodie. Ok sorry, I'm gonna stop. Oh my god, too loud! Oh, this song's hecka good, too. Comin outta my cage and I've been doin just fine And she's callin a cab ahhh I cry to this one...a lot. It's not a bop, but it's like a nice little chill, crying jam. You know what I'm saying? I also love Mac Demarco. He's like my idol. I love the strokes. Oh my god, that lady is judging me so hard right now. oh my god, another lady is judging me. What the f*ck do you want? Oh my god. I love this song too -- wow it is really, truly good. It's a little bit weird, but give it a chance. It's like, at first you listen to it and you're like, ""the f*ck is this?"" then you listen to it like 10 times and you're like (wow) Um, I just witnessed that guy full-on picking his nose. No holding back, Just picking his nose as hard as he possibly can. It's fine Everyone does it, but for some reason, when I see people picking their nose in their car, it really catches me off guard. No, I'm just kidding *wheezes* I am jamming out a little bit too hard. Like, it's just a little bit worrisome Now I'm in a parking garage and I think people are gonna judge me, I'm scared. but i don't care. this guy is staring at me, please leave me alone. I'm trying to film a f*cking weird video. used to par-tay gonna guess it's only This song is like me and my squad's song. You know, we always listen to this together. AHH! NO! Somebody saw me SO bad. That's so embarrassing! Oh my god I'm like hiding. I'm literally hiding. Oh my god. They saw me so bad. They saw me SO bad. Oh, my god, literally. They saw the entire thing that was like the most embar- Oh my god, no. They're coming back around. They're coming back around! Oh god no, no, no. I'm normally not embarrassed, but that was really bad. I left my Spotify down below, if you want to check it out to see everything I'm listening to. My current playlist that I'm adding to is called like ""fall"", or something. Because, you know, it's fall. So cute and creative, right? That's it. Those are the songs I'm digging right now. If you guys like kind of picked up on what my music taste is and you have any songs that you think I would like, leave them down below, and check out my Spotify and do all of the above. But, now I have to go into the Apple store And I'm not too pumped about it because, if they tell me I have to like, leave my laptop for a long periodically time, I'm gonna have to tell them guys It's not gonna happen because guess what? I need my computer to edit so, they cannot take it from me. That's not allowed. I'm just hoping for the best so, please pray for me. Even though by the time you see this it would have already happened, so like, you can't pray for me. Cause...it's too late. It's like a frickin' ghost town out here There's literally no one at the mall. I mean, it's probably cuz it's just early in the morning But like, it's kind of freaking me out. Like, maybe there's an apocalypse, and I didn't know about it. Oh, my god, are they even open yet? There's literally not one person in there. So that could be either a good thing or a bad thing *snort* They're closed. Until 10:00. I have 30 minutes. I don't know what to do with myself. I mean, I probably should have checked the hours before I came. Maybe i'll get a coffee. In the mall that I'm at right now, they don't have any coffee, which is annoying, but they have a pressed juice place. So I'm gonna be healthy and go get some pressed juice. I'm actually not getting actual juice. I'm getting like, pressed, like frozen yogurt. If you haven't seen that before, it's basically like vegan frozen yogurt, and then you can get like toppings and stuff. So, I think I'm just gonna get that. And I'm getting frozen yogurt for breakfast, so that's where my life is right now. I'll do a little pressed juice haul. So, the first thing I got was the pressed freeze thing and I got the flavor, vanilla and then On top I got almond butter and chocolate. It's so frickin good. Please eat that. It's so good. Okay, and then I also got a coffee. Coffee, almonds, dates, vanilla, sea salt. So, I was gonna hold off on getting coffee until later, but I'll just get another one later and call it a day. Just finished at the Apple Store. Sorry, I didn't film in there I was literally in there for two hours waiting for the Genius Bar guy to come help me out, but after waiting literally two hours, they came, and they helped me and I told them about my problems, and they fixed my keyboard for free, which is really cool So even though I had to wait two hours, I'm not that mad because they fixed it for free and that's always good because we like free things in this family. I actually really want coffee, so looks like we need to go get one. Oh, I am on the sidewalk. Okay. Oh, this is so illegal. That was super ""not allowed,"" like there's just -- in no way is that allowed. That's really loud. Going to get coffee now. Sorry, I'm like squinting, so I look like a -- old man. (Off camera) Go ahead. (To camera) That is so awkward. Oh my god. I'm jaywalking, guys. Don't take advice from me. I'm not feeling so hot I really need that sh* t, man. My body's reliant on it *flatly* Yay, *singing* I'm so excited, found my coffee. She made it really strong today, I always think it looks so funny because like, it's an iced drink but it's in like a ""hot drink"" kind of cup, so like I put this straw in like the top and it looks kind of tacky, but who frickin' cares it gets the job done, do you know what I mean? Okay, I'm gonna go home now. I just got out of the shower I showered for the first time in like, you know, a year. No big deal. This is good chapstick. Is it gonna focus or no? Good chapstick if you want to try it out. It's really good. I'm putting on a face mask because, my skin is absolute ass. I'm using this Origins Clear Improvements Active Charcoal mask to clear pores cuz you best believe your b*tch needs that. *slight disgust* awgh You know, I try to do face masks as often as I can, because I feel like they're good for me. I don't even know if they actually work, but if they do, then hopefully I'm reaping the benefits. I don't even know if that's the right word to use. Oh my god. That's really ugly I love painting this on with a paintbrush. If you guys don't know an efficient way to get on your face masks I definitely recommend using a paintbrush. It's a little bit weird. It's a little bit DIY, but it's lots of fun. Okay, wow this looks absolutely amazing. Okay, that's it. *laughs* That's about it for today's vlog. I hope you enjoyed it.

Sorry, we're back now well first things first. I'm the realest no I'm just kidding first things first Let's discuss the fact that I'm wearing a turtleneck, and if you're wondering why that is happening It's because it's October now, and I'm really starting to feel that crispy cold fall air outside And I'm digging it no one cares about that, so let's get into the video this might be the stupidest video. I've ever made Possibly, but I'm still extremely excited about it. Here's why when I was younger like maybe 7 I was obsessed with YouTube of course I've been obsessed with YouTube since I was literally born I've always loved it But I've gone through like trends of what I like to watch I had a phase there where I only watched Fred And then I also had a phase there where I was obsessed with beauty videos. I loved makeup videos I loved makeup tutorials, okay But there's this little gray area when I was about 7 where I only watched a certain genre of videos No joke for the entire year that I was like 7 I only watched these type of videos that was it and it's poppin cookin videos if you don't know what these are Let me explain pop and cooking it's basically this like Japanese or Something kind of brand where they have these little kits where you basically like make little candy This is just sounding more and more stupid as I'm saying it little kits where you can basically make Candies that are shaped like foods for example. This one is like burger and fries Mix you it'll make more sense when I pull it out, but I would no joke watch videos of other people Making these every single day for like a year that was the only thing I watched on YouTube one day I kind of had this weird flashback to my 7 year old days of me watching these and I was like oh my god I totally forgot that that was my sh#t back in the day. You know that was a huge time of my life Where all I did was watch poppin cookin videos and now now I'm my own youtuber And I haven't even considered making a poppin making I haven't even considered making a poppin cookin video I went on Amazon and I searched poppin cookin and you'll never guess what I found I found poppin cookin so today's video I'm just going to be making some and fulfilling my childhood dream as simple as that I am so excited because despite the fact that I literally was so obsessed with them. I never even considered buying any myself. I just wanted to watch other people make them Yes, I'm also considering whether or not I was a normal child I don't think I was the two that I have with me today number one. Ice cream funny part about this one I literally remember watching people make this specific one and then also this hamburger and french fries one I'm really excited, and I definitely have high expectations because I think this was a very large portion of my childhood And if it doesn't live up to my dreams. I'm gonna be extremely upset Yep No, I remember how everybody used to always complain when they would make these about the fact that all of the directions are like not In English that might potentially be a problem today. We will soon find out okay. It looks like I need scissors I Just have a bunch of like miscellaneous packages look at these mini. That is so cute Can you see it look how f#ckin' cute that is Oh? Oh, it smells so much like plastic that smells like a dog toy, so I don't know where the directions Are you stupid? I don't know how everybody else always figured this shit out. Okay? Do you want? I'm just gonna wing it? Oh this smells good That was so stupid No! oh my god, that's so gross, I just trying to like lick the powder and see if it tasted good And it doesn't taste good. Oh, Oh No okay, okay? Okay this one oh this one does not have a smell at all this powder is white this other one was kind of pink and strawberry so I'm Assuming that's like the ice-cream part But this one's just like white and like looks kind of like cocaine I mean oh my god It is so stupid. I bet the directions are on the back of the box. Okay. Oh, okay, okay? I just did a little bit of reading And you see how there's just like little thing oh think so I guess I'm supposed to cut this off I use this as like a measuring cup, and I like take water and like pour it in okay hold on out oh No Okay, so far. This is pretty self-explanatory. I mean the language barrier isn't stopping me Oh smells like strawberry strawberry delight Um each color is like an ice cream flavor so we have like strawberry and then I guess we have vanilla or something I don't know. Oh, man. I'm having the time of my life Okay So now I guess you fill half of the bag with like the vanilla and then one half like the strawberry So let's just jump right into it ooh. This totally got thick This is getting really thick okay, so now that's in this weird piping bag. The only step. I have it's to decorate Let's do this sh#t. I'm actually most excited about the ice cream cones. Oh My god, it's so cute, and mini I cannot wait to freakin eat this. Holy sh#t. Oh my god look look look look look it can sit up stand up in it it can stand up because there's Because there's like little holes. Do you know what I'm saying that means that I can stick it in does that make sense okay? I'm excited about that. okay another one this looks good enough to eat. I am so excited okay Oh wait, is this like an ice-cream sandwich? Huh look at this freaking. Oh my god. That's the cutest thing I've ever frickin seen look at that It looks just like an ice-cream sandwich. This is so cute okay last, but not least they gave me sprinkles Nothing is finalized without the sprinkles so Okay, well I just wasted a bunch of them I think I'm gonna have to like do the initial taste test with the ice cream cone because ice cream cone is like the cutest One in my opinion, so let's just jump right into it mmmm Wow it actually kind of tastes good why does this taste really good oh my god? Wow, what a f#cking experience number one you start out with an extremely therapeutic and eye-opening baking experience you fully submerge Yourself in the ability to cook and once you're done cooking the rewards just keep coming the flavor is just Absolutely impeccable truly truly a beautiful experience. I would recommend to all I have another one I'm a little bit more worried about this one because I'm not sure if it's gonna like taste like a burger and fries or if they're gonna like make it like candy tasting does that make sense this one is a burger fries and a coke very generous I think I wrote it down this time around so I think this one might be a little bit easier, or less confusing Oh, whoa, whoa this one has a lot more tools to it. We got a knife. This is dangerous We got another spoon, but then we also have like 15 different packets, so this one's definitely gonna be slightly more complex And I don't know if I'm ready, but I think I am there's a lot of removing separate parts in this one Okay, so first I think we're gonna be making the French fries if I'm assuming correctly rumor has it I'm supposed to pour all of this Into here add water mix it up. Oh, it's really liquidy That smells very odd. It doesn't even smell bad. It just the weirdest thing I've ever smelled in my life I mean I've smelled some really weird stuff, but let's not talk about that I might have potentially done this wrong, but I'm not sure did I I don't know okay? I think I thought that I was making the French fries But I accidentally just made the burger buns instead is that possible this is so confusing. Yeah, I think I did okay well That's fine, because I can just pour this into here and instead I don't know I really hope I can pull myself together because yeah, this is going downhill fast, and I mean fast people Oh wait, am I supposed to put that in the fucking microwave? Are you kidding me? I don't know if I want to put this in the microwave I'm a little bit afraid of that, but I mean I guess ok BRB I don't know even I'm gonna put it in for like five second intervals so that I don't make my house explode shoo, I definitely Accidentally put the burger mix, and then thought it was french fry mix So it's like instead of making the French fries and accidentally yeah I'm just gonna shove it inside of the burger bun mold and just hope for the best, but I'm definitely disappointed in myself I'm disappointed in my ability to read directions I thought I was better than this but apparently I really wasn't but I guess life Isn't as perfect as we all think it's gonna be now is it. I'm just shoving it into the mold I thought I was making the french fries But apparently I wasn't I think this yellow one might be the one it fucking smells like potatoes I don't know what to do with myself. That's so weird I'm so afraid before I like wasn't nervous to taste this this But now I realized that they're actually trying to make this like like the actual do you know what I'm saying like they're trying to Make it like an actual potato I'm gonna go warm this up in the microwave for a few seconds because I guess that's how this works I Don't want it to taste like a potato do you know what I mean? I guess you're just supposed to cut them into fries, duh I'm gonna set these aside for now cuz I'm done with the french fries that one okay next step I guess I'm making the burger itself That is so gross Okay, this one smells like more like a burger. I'm so worried, okay I'm gonna go warm up the burger and it's buns real quick The buns are like already permanently in here, so I'm just gonna warm those up again even though I warned them up earlier if you know what I'm talking about. I think I did something wrong here because oh f*uck Okay um I think I just accidentally microwaved the ketchup thinking that it was the burger mix So that's an issue. I'm just gonna put the ketchup in here then for safekeeping for some reason I am really messing this one up. It's not my fault that the directions Don't make sense you know I'm doing my best here, okay I'm just gonna start smelling things and then assuming what it is. This could really be anything I'm just gonna mix it with some water And hope that it turns into the drink because that would make the most sense. Nope it's not what could this even be Hey shut up, this is the cheese oh? Okay, so I guess this is the cheese and I guess you're just supposed to flatten it out Okay, I'm cutting this cheese into fourths and then I'm forgetting that it even exists because I'm genuinely grossed out see it's a little cheese Square perfect every time I frickin unleash a package It's never what I think it's gonna be so I'm starting to lose hope in myself I think that this one's the burger, but at this point. I don't even believe in myself. Are you kidding me? This is the cola one, and I put okay? Do you know what? Okay, so here's the Cola. I accidentally put it into the little burger mold, so that's stupid But it was like fizzing and now it's not fizzing anymore wait. Where's the burger mix like? I okay? It's this one It's definitely the brown one at this point. I'm giving up if it's not the brown one I don't even know what is this smells like actual dog food, okay? So this is obviously the burger one so that's fucking gross. I am a dramatic person, but still it's really bad I feel like this is like potentially poisonous I'm also a vegetarian so something about the fact that like I have to eat this meat even though It's fake and it probably doesn't actually have meat in it which it might I don't know, and I can't read Japanese so like I will never know for sure I'm gonna go warm this up for once and for all and then we'll start assembling the burger Let's take out the burger see how it looks okay. That is sad right oh My god. I'm like emotionally and physically tired from filming this video because it's just been a lot These are the french fries wait when is it gonna focus on it? Do you want it? I'm give up okay, so the french fries are done, so I'm gonna Leave that right there next we have our demented burger, bun they really do not look good like they're supposed to be all smooth and fluffy and like they look like this and that's not a Patty if that's what you guys call it then we're gonna add a piece of cheese Then we're gonna add some ketchup slash sauce oh, man that looks so good then we're gonna add another slice of cheese Holy shit. This is like the biggest burger. I've ever seen Man that looks good. It's probably not gonna focus, but like you can kind of see it, and I really can't focus it That's the final product. I am NOT excited about this I have a feeling it's going to be gross, and I'm probably gonna be really dramatic about it So just prepare yourself so first. Let's try the french fries because why not right okay? It just tastes sad doesn't really taste bad It kind of tastes sad okay next let's try the coke because I'm avoiding trying the acutal burger itself oh That's also really sad let's try the burger. This is the only burger I've ever tried in my life I've never dried a hamburger because I've been vegetarian my entire life. I have never tried a hamburger hang a Hamburger you don't believe me ask my parents oh My god no the aftertaste is very bad I mean look this one overall I would not recommend the directions don't make sense tried to color-code the directions And it just doesn't match up So I would not recommend it overall poppin cookin it I would say lived up to my expectations because even though Ii won me over the first one was so great that i'm just gonna? I'm just gonna say that that one kind of made it worth it for me overall I Hope that you enjoyed this video as much as my seven-year-old self enjoyed poppin cookin videos back in the day if you did give it A thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want I love you all so much, and I can't wait to see you next time if you did like this video And you want to see more videos with me doing poppin cookin I literally have two more of them sitting over there so I can make another video if you guys want you guys have to let Me know so that's what you want, so if you did then let me know.

Check out his channel!! - https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-10-02T01:50:26Z,164230,6488996,5128,"Happy September 29! Actually, no, do you know what? We're not starting like that. I just woke up from a nap, and I know I seem a little bit groggy... So, it'll probably wear off in a little bit... But, we are gonna have to deal with stupid Emma for the next like 20 minutes. You know, I'm still in sleep mode right now. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, #1- Happy Friday! No! F**k! I'm about to hit that car! Happy September, 29th! Do you guys know what today is? Well, I f**king know what today is... Today is National Coffee Day! Round of applause you best be-f**ing believe, that I'm celebrating today! No joke, this entire vlog is gonna be... just what I'm doing to celebrate National Coffee Day. This has a lot of room for error But I'm gonna try to hit all of my favorite coffee places today, which is about... ...5 or 6. And, like that's not that much coffee. Though I might need to like up the ante you know I might need to do a little bit more because I feel like I've had six coffees in a day before so I Need to kind of like you know I need to make sure I'm doing something special I have a lot of coffee places that I like, but like half of them are in San Francisco. And I'm not gonna drive all the way there, just so that I can get the coffee's I like, sorry! Despite what most might assume, I am NOT that insane! Oh my god, parking spot right in front. Shut the f**k up somebody was honking at me! haha! I'm wearing this ""Latte Gang"" Merch~ Guess who's merch it is? It's mine. So, if you want this and you want to wear it next time... ...it's National Coffee Day! Link is in the bio.. self promo. Merch link in bio! But, look at this s**t! This is how you know today's gonna be a good day. Normally. It takes me like 15 minutes to find parking. I, no joke, just pulled up right in front of the place, smooth as sugar! Ewww... Is that? Do people say that? I don't know. Can I have an iced latte, with almond milk? Okay, I also just thought about this, and I'm like okay I literally planned out my entire day. But, I realized like I can't just go from one coffee place to the next. Because, then I won't have finished the last coffee. I think I might just like run over... ok, this is like really weird.. but, I think I might just run over to the thrift shop right now, because it's really close to the next coffee place.. I'm gonna be going to. So, it's like when I just go into the thrift store, thrift around a little bit, until I finish my coffee and then go to... the next coffee place! I'm basically just gonna be trying to figure out how to kill time for like the rest of the entire day. But, that's ok! National Coffee Day the best day of the year! This is literally better than my birthday. Ughhhh... I'm going to go to Best Buy... and I'm gonna see if I can get a new vlogging camera. Because, I use my phone like I'm literally vlogging on my phone right now & it works great. If you're interested in vlogging /you vlog/whatever... and you don't know what to use. Honestly, like the iPhone is great for vlogging. But, I kinda just want to up the quality of my channel a little bit. Say I'm gonna go to Best Buy and see if.. I can get one of those Canon G7x's~ That's just what everyone else has, so it must be good. That's my mentality. That's great, right? I didn't even like call in or check online. I'm just gonna like blindly hope that... (***fart noise x3***) What was the word? ***fart noise*** That they have it. I don't know why I couldn't think of that. Also, literally my outfit today is absolute chaos! it's chaos! It's so bad, so as you know on the top half things are going okay? We're wearing my own frickin merch, so I must like it. You know what I mean. Let me show you my bottom half... it's very bad. I don't have a mirror near me, so I'm gonna have to just improvise. On my shoes, we have these new Adidas. Adidas- adidas that I just got. And, I love them. I'm obsessed with that, but they're so ugly. Brandi shorts~ I'm actually really excited, cuz I haven't gone thrifting in a few weeks. It won't be like a normal thrifting sesh~ just a quick one! (***Crowd Cheers!!!***) Okay, um not to be dramatic or anything, but I'm the stupidest b**ch I've ever met! So, here's what just happened... after I got out of the thrift shop... I got in the car, and I started filming myself, and I started driving to the next coffee place. And... I was filming the wrong way. Off to our next coffee place! I don't even know how.. like how do you even mess that up? That's like not a hard thing to like do correctly. I'm at the second coffee place. They have coffee... and they have like toast- trendy toast. Because, you know the trendy food that all the cafes serve these days, is trendy toast. Avocado toast, peanut butter and banana toast, almond butter and banana toast. All the fun toasts!! So, I'm gonna probably get one of those, too. Because, it's bad for me to have a s**t ton of caffeine and not be eating food. So, I need to do that, but let me show you what I bought at the thrift shop before I get this coffee. I wasn't really in the mood to do a long, like extended, very in-depth thrifting experience. Because, you know, looking through every single.. frickin rack and like all that. I just- I couldn't. I just took like a quick little scan and I didn't really find anything. But, when I first walked in I actually saw these glasses... (***Crowd Booing***) and I decided you know what? These are fun. They'll probably come in handy at some point. So, I bought them. I have no clue when I will ever wear these, but I think that they're fun. I don't know... they give me like lonely cat lady vibes and like that's low-key me. Even though, I don't really like cats that much, but I mean I like them, but like I like dogs more. You know... but, like lonely cat lady vibes! But, here's the story with these... you know, I shopped around for a while... and then I got in line. What you're supposed to do and I was checking out and I realized I forgot my credit card in the car. So, I left the glasses on the desk, and I was like oh, I'll be right back... let me just go run and get my card! She was like, ""no worries"". So, I run to my car, get my credit card and then when I get back... There's a long-ass line, that was just not there before. So, I had to wait in the line. And then I got the glasses and they were $1.00 something in my soul told me, ""Emma, you need those!"" So, I'm just gonna follow it, so that was my story. Oh, and then also when I was done, like checking out and she gave me my receipt... I like, just started walking out of the store... and I like forgot my card, like she was like, ""Oh Miss, like you forgot your card!"" And I'm like, why the f**k can't I, like have my- I keep forgetting my card places all these all the time! Like, 1st I frickin forget it in the car, and then I frickin leave it at the thrift shop! Jesus Christ, I need help. I'm already hyped up. I power finished this! So, I'm freaking ready for my next one. Let's go! Coffee #2! Ooh... This one's really good. I also got food! I got this peanut butter.. banana toast, and they cut the peanut butter, I mean they cut the bananas so thick. Oh, Hell YEAH! Update: just finished my toast and I feel so gross! Maybe it's cuz' I drank two coffees, within the span of like 20 minutes?! I think today's gonna be a little bit tougher than I anticipated. My tummy hurts! Despite this, let's go to Best Buy! Ughhh! (***Crowd Cheering!!!***) To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Best Buy. But, I feel like this is my only option. So, here I am. I can also order the camera off Amazon, but like-ehh. I want to see if I can get it right now! Ok, so just finish up Best Buy, and they actually had every single thing that I needed. Which is really cool! I finally got a frickin vlogging camera I need to go home and get a SD card for it so that I can start freaking using it because, duh~ But, I also got a freaking huge like tripod for it.. I feel like it might be too big, so we're gonna decide and then the last thing I got was a aux cord. That also charges your phone because right now, I don't have that. I'm not even sure if it's gonna work, because the guy was like... didn't really know what he was talking about and he was like,... ""Yeah, it will maybe work for an aux"" and I'm like, ""So, do you think it'll work with the aux cord?"" & he was like, ""Maybe..."" ...and I'm like, ""Ok!"". Well, I don't want a MAYBE,I want a... No... I just f**king broke my scissors! These were my car scissors!! Sorry about that. I use these like every day! I don't know why I always need to cut stuff when I'm in the car, but..guess I'll need to get some new car scissors. But, anyways! Oh! Oh, this is- this is, kind of fun~ Let's go home! Let's get an SD card and let's switch over to this camera. Right now, I'm going to charge my camera for a little bit. And then, we're gonna do some mail time. Because, I got some mail! So, I want to open it up and show you guys. What I- some of the stuff I got.. and then after that we're gonna go back out and get more coffees, because I've only gotten 2 today, and that is not enough. Ok. So, first let me start out by saying, that I read every single letter. I open every single package, etc. So, just because I didn't include it in this, does not mean I didn't see it! So, one thing that I got that I thought was ficken hilarious... was this! There's a 100% chance that this will come in handy at some point in my life. And, so... I'm actually very glad that his person sent this to me. So, thank you so much if you sent this to me. I also got a tweet that was like, ""Emma, I'm sending you a Grinch eye-mask,"" and I like read it and I was like that's really random and then like I... go to my PO Box, and it's like in there, and I was like well... don't mind if I do! So, that was kind of funny! Someone also sent me, a package, with of course a letter and then a bunch of other random stuff in it and some of my... favorite things that I got in that package, was this cute little suede scrunchie. Definitely a fan! It's very cute, and it even matches my hair tie. She also gave me a keychain, for the US Open, and umm..I thought this was really freaking dope and I was excited about it! It's from 2015, and I thought it was cool, because I've always wanted to go to the US Opens. But, I don't live in LA. I live in the Bay, so don't ever get to go. But, one day, I'm gonna go... and it'll be fun, And, then the last thing, some girl... sent me slime. As you guys know, I made this slime video. So, I'll leave the link to my slime video down below. Waste, they tried to make slime. And, it was an absolute fail. Some girl heard my cry for help and was like, ""oh my god... ""this girl needs slime,"" so she sent me some slime. And, I'm pumped! Her slime account @honeyslimezzzzz With five Z's! So, she made me a bunch of slimes that like, relate to like my channel. For example, this one is.. mediocre vegan cookie slime and I made a video called, ""mediocre vegan cookies!"" I'm not gonna unwrap them all. Cuz, she wrapped them super tightly with scotch tape. Because, she didn't want them to leak, which I think is so freaking cute! I'm going to do a little slime ASMR right now for you guys, so pumped about it, because like, I've never done... slime ASMR or anything I've always just watched the videos online and I've always wanted to do one myself. And it has, it's like a fishbowl slime, she says. Listen to this s**t! This is so exciting! I really hope that if I led this onto my desk. It doesn't like ruin my desk. We'll cross that bridge, when we get to it. This is my dream come true! Oh my God! it doesn't stick to the desk! I'm gonna try to do all the techniques that all the like, the professional slime accounts do, you know? I'm freaking killing it! Oh my god, if I had a slime account and no one would follow it. Iced, almond milk latte. Which is extremely fitting for today! Oh my God! This is so fun! You know, let's just fricking~ let this out on the table. Look at this! I'm a mess! Oh my God! Oh, no. I'm making the entire container such a mess. I'm so freakin stupid! I should have like, went and washed my hands in between, but oh yeah, baby.. We're gonna be doing slime this slime Smells like sour candy I'm done with the whispering it. That's stupid. Oh whoa So I've only got two coffees so far today, and it's like three o'clock. I'm not gonna lie I kind of feel like a failure. I don't know I haven't been on my a-game today when it comes to coffee consumption It's okay, though. I'm going to go get my third right now. I'm picking up lily actually and then we're gonna get coffee together oh My god, she just pulled up No joke I turned on the camera and I was like I was about to say like Oh like you know just pull up to Lily's house. Well. She's not even here yet like that's no joke exactly what I was gonna say it. She just pulled up Oh lily has um A pile. No put your hand behind it so everybody can see cuz like you know like yeah Thank you. It looks much better. Third coffee of the day.

That's bad. What's up guys? It's Emma, and in today's video I'm going to be doing an extremely basic and overdone video idea which is trying pumpkin spiced flavored shit I know okay, I know a lot of people have done this before and you might be like Emma You know? We've already seen this a hundred times. I know. My kind of idea with that, you know I'm gonna go to the store And I'm gonna get the pumpkin spice flavored stuff that no one gets, because usually people go to the store And they get pumpkin spice Oreos and pumpkin spice pop-tarts, and then they eat it and act like it tastes like shit But we all know that it tastes good You know they're just trying to make it seem like it tastes gross to keep things interesting I went to the store, and I got stuff I truly believe that I might hate. Stuff That's a little bit iffy. The first thing I got was pumpkin spice pumpkin seeds from Trader Joe's I think that this is a little bit overkill. I'm not gonna lie I mean like it's kind of like ironic a little bit, okay. I need scissors. Okay. They smell really freaking good Boy You know what starting this video up strong these are really freaking good. I'm really impressed. You know what? Okay, I got I need to save room for the other things in this video Those are really good like I genuinely enjoyed those I would happily found all those down my throat on a daily basis because they're that good I did down Hope that I hate some of this stuff Just you know to keep the video interesting, but the next thing I got I'm a little bit concerned about pumpkin soup crackers I don't know. I mean I don't know how this could go. I personally wouldn't normally buy this so also. I don't understand What a soup Crocker is does that mean you eat it with soup Because these are soup crackers I think that I need to eat these with soup just so that I don't you know Disrespect them in any way also, maybe they're like really good with soup So I'm gonna go see if I have any soup in my cabinet. I'll be right back wow wow instead of soup I thought you know what I'm just gonna boil some water Put it in a bowl and it'll be close enough to soup so like when I dip it It'll you know It'll be like similar enough So I don't know if I'm supposed to dip it or if I'm just supposed to completely put them in I don't know living into or on top of the soup, you know this is an interesting way of doing things, but Why the fuck they smell like cheese, I'm not gonna judge a book by its cover, let's just eat the soup crackers Okay that tastes like what a burp smells like so I'm not a fan you buy these crackers don't eat them like that Don't put them into the soup. Don't do that. Let's see if they're better just on their own They taste like cheese this tastes nothing like pumpkin this tastes like cheese, and there's no cheese anywhere in the ingredients, okay? I'm done with these these are playing with my mind I wanted them to taste like pumpkin and they taste like cheese, so that's like that kind of turns me off You know what I mean like because they wanted them to taste like pumpkin I hate them because they don't taste like pumpkin at all okay So that's the end of that after that I kind of need a little refresher So I have two pumpkin flavored drinks that we can try Okay, the first one is this good karma dairy-free pumpkin spice nog made with flax milk I've never had flax milk before so this is going to be interesting, but oh this smells good, though I'm not pouring myself a lot because I just assume that I'm gonna eat it and so like oh Oh my god, Oh Oh my god. That's so good Wow I feel like a new woman. This is so frickin good If you're at Whole Foods, and you see this pick it up by what would this video be if I didn't mix this with coffee Huh, I have just done something oh my god you heard it here first this in coffee mixed together in a plus combination a freaking life-changing Monumental moment in history right now It just happened because this is a great combination Wow I feel Awakened as a human being I feel like freaking Steve Jobs right now like when he created the Apple computer well Yeah, this is even better This is what it feels like to be a genius, you know what this video. It's going a little bit too well I'm hoping that I start hating things But then I also like realize that I really don't hate like that many foods cuz like food to me is food You know I mean, it's all frickin good I mean not all there's quite a few students that I actually hate the next drink is this limited-edition Almond dream almond milk pumpkin spiced with cinnamon drink these two might end up being like the same thing, but I'm not sure yet Let's try it out this one smells a little bit less sweet than the last one the last one smells really freaking sweet and luscious this one smells a little bit more spicy oh No no no no no oh no no oh no no No, what a disappointment actually it's fine I would normally be more angry that this one tastes like shit, but because this one's so good I'm not even mad it just tastes too spicy There's too much Spicy in it it tastes too much like pumpkin spice if you took a spoonful of pumpkin spice and ate it like that's what this Tastes like am I a fan of it. No. I'm not but you know what just like we did with the last one Let's be fair and let's mix it with coffee Just in case it redeems itself that way sometimes coffee can fix everything so who knows oh? No That's so gross. Oh yeah, that's not good, and I'm not even like being dramatic for the sake of this video I'm not just being dramatic like are you sure about that that's genuinely not good almond dream I give you props for trying, but now that was not good Okay, next next we have cereal. I'm pumped about this because I have a freaking genius idea. Are you ready for this? This is freaking legendary part 2 the freakin pumpkin spice flax milk it mixed with Trader Joe's pumpkin spice O's That rhymed mixed together in this bowl, and I have a feeling that this is gonna. Be really freakin good Let me smell them first. They don't smell the best before I try it with the milk Let's try them on their own barrels just on their own when you first eat it it Just tastes like a regular honey nut cheerios the aftertaste though is quite pumpkin spicy so I mean they're fine I think they'll probably taste better with the milk, so let's see Yes, I prove well moving on that is a frickin level-10 combination I think that I can come to the conclusion that that flax milk stuff is really good and like can make anything better So I'm very I'm very satisfied with that next thing we have I'm actually Genuinely upset about because I know it's gonna be gross pumpkin baby food, but sadly they didn't just have plain pumpkin baby food It was like pumpkin and something else the only one I could find was pumpkin and spinach baby food I know I'm setting myself up for failure here. I'm aware. I know that this is gonna. Be gross Also there's a decent chance that I'm gonna have like a funny reaction when I eat this so you know Let's just spice up the video a little bit. Okay. It looks like diarrhea. I'm not surprised oh God that's not good. That's really not good. It really smells nasty eat Jenny I mean it really genuinely smells bad But I mean what did I expect I don't think I can eat? More than just like a tongue dip like I'm just gonna do a little Hold on. Let me get this ready. Just in case I need to like have a quick swig of something You know to get the flavor out of my mouth oh My god no ah oh you know This isn't even pumpkin spice flavor, so maybe it just needs a little bit of help Maybe we can make it better pumpkin pie spice, baby. You know what let's spice it up a little bit This is almost like a combination of the baby food challenge in the freaking cinnamon challenge I'm freaking killing it with the YouTube trends up in here The pumpkin spice made it so much worse note to self when I turn like whatever age And I have my own kid I will never feed them bullshit like this this tastes so bad babies have taste buds too literally I'm sad right now thinking about the fact that babies have to eat that I guess that was it for today's video That was kind of random I hope you enjoyed it if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want I love you all so much appreciate every single one of you. I'll see you next time  "

My friend Lilly, aka ""Lilly Wolfe Photography"" is coming home from a volleyball tournament tonight. And me and my friend, Ream, thought it would be fun if we went, and we picked her up from the airport. As for the rest of the vlog, I don't know. This vlog could be three days long. This vlog could be...one day long. I don't know yet. Okay, so I'm with Ream and we're getting frozen yogurt. And I pulled into this parking spot. And liTERALLY -- Ream: Emma Chamberlain There's a line, there's the line, there's my car. Okay, so Rheem bought a megaphone off Amazon. Explain your reasoning? It's just...something you need. I think I'm gonna try to use it. Shrieking cuz I have such a pretty voice. *both laugh* *singing I Will Always Love You* AND I *laughs* will al- [song} I literally think I just went deaf. Do you want to tell us about what you got? Uh yeah. So *laugh* somewhere in there is vanilla. See, it's right there 
Emma: Okay.
Ream: And then, tart. Peanut butter chip. and this is the yogurt chip,
Emma: Okay which is mistaken for white chocolate chips, most of the time. Which is not fair. Because they don't receive the credit they get, cuz everyone skips over them. But then that's okay, because there's more for me. *Emma wheezes* And these are cookie dough bits. Emma: And that's it?
Ream: Mmhm. Emma: Give this video a thumbs up for more frozen yogurt hauls, and we'll post more in the future. Okay, Reem? Throw it out Reem Mean you can't just pee like that Reem that's gross you just pray We don't litter though we don't let her take that back put in the trash Wow rad lows right now because I need to get a mirror for my room But after that me and Raymond my mom ream are gonna go pick up Lily from the airport I cannot wait so that's what's happening, and I hope that you're not confused. No. We got this mirror. It looks freaking awesome I can't believe it. This is like the best mirror. I've ever seen are you excited about it? We're at the airport now we're waiting for Lily pretty pumped pretty nervous haven't seen her in years How do you feel that Lily's coming back you know? She's taking a very long time Lily where that are you you know what the new car when you run in the window, and it's so crisp Okay, she's coming can we go out there room? Where she yet? Where is she at? Where is she at all right? We've been walking around can't find her fricken anywhere He's literally been running around for 20 minutes his bad, I cannot Dream was that he's a sneaker Good morning, it's lunchtime I'm just confused because all this in Italian And so I literally to Google every single word on the menu because I just don't know what it all means So like I don't even know what I'm getting so we're just gonna have to hope that it's good In salat I can't say it Food was good It ended up being a salad when it came in which is what I expected so you know what my Italian reading is Doing pretty well, but now we're going to get coffee because you know it's just a rule in life I really want Phil's, but it was too crowded. We literally couldn't even freakin get in so we're going to another one Let's cross town 20 minutes away. Let's go yes Ream it stands up It's the next day I feel like this vlog has been so unorganized It's like I've logged so far two days, but I haven't gotten like a full day of log footage So I'm just like gonna compile it all together and just hope it's not a freaking hot mess today I don't know I think that I want to go and I want to pick up a pumpkin spice latte Try it out, and see how it is. I've never tried one before and they just came out. I have my planner here I'm just gonna plan out my day because I have to plan out my day or else I don't get anything done the funny thing though about Pumpkin spice lattes is that it's hot coffee, right? I think you could probably get it iced But I don't want to try it I used to because I want to try the og pumpkin spice latte Regular straight out the presses except with almond milk instead, but you know what I'm trying to say I don't like sweet drinks, and I don't like hot drinks So I have a really decent feeling that I'm not gonna like it I also might end up going to the mall today and picking up some new shoes Because my vans are trashed take a look at this Which is not even an issue I mean, I'll like continue to wear them because they're still wearable shoes But my little toe gets cold, okay, I wanted the red checkered vans They're sold out literally everywhere, and I want them so bad, but they're literally sold out everywhere cannot find them anywhere And I'm very sad about it. I just drove over to my P o box and I got a package I'm pumped open in the video your wish is my command. I'm not open it if you want to send me something I'll leave my yo box address in the description So this is the first thing that I've ever received in my P o box so Isabella if you're watching this you are a homie, and you're the first person to send me something and I'm pumped she She wrote me a letter So cute yes, hi little I need this so friggin bad. My skin is like literal right now She gave me frozen stickers Isabella if you're freaking watching this you are a homie This is the sweetest thing I've ever in my entire life. I'm gonna cherish this for as my life. Thank you. I love you That's me my dad two hours later today is a legendary last day right now I am on my way to get my first-ever pumpkin spice latte. I literally live like less than a mile away No like closer like less than a half of a mile away from a Starbucks But guess what I'm driving anyways cuz I'm so lazy. This is an extremely rare time I never go to Starbucks everybody counts down the days until fall for this one weenie drink And I want to know what it's all a freaking bow despite if I like it or not It'll still be a great time. This is a parking spot. Yes, but this person's fucking doors in the way Oh, that's good annoying. Oh my god. I'm so mad I was about to pull into a parking spot But then somebody had their car door open so I couldn't go into the spot and now I'm pissed. Okay. It's fine I'm still bit irritable. I haven't had a coffee in like two hours every single vlog I've ever made in my entire life at least one portion of it is me complaining about not being able to find parking But it's a genuine issue in my life And I just want to share with you guys and then after that I think I'm gonna go to the mall and get myself new Shoes, I put off buying new shoes because I feel like they're I don't know I don't like spending money on shoes I don't know why that just pisses me off I'd rather spend money on like coffee, but you know what enough with the rambling. Let's go get ourselves a freakin PSL alright Is that what they call it for short PSL pumpkin spice latte? Thank you. I got the latte initial response. I think it's completely overpriced I just frickin pay four dollars and 45 cents for this much coffee. I don't know at the same time I spend that much on eyes on in those lattes all the time and never questioned it so maybe I'm just biased Let's smell it first Okay, it kind of smells good like it smells good, but it also kind of smells like ass But I'm not gonna make my final judgement until I actually try it so let's try it It's probably gonna be really hot so I'm gonna wait a little bit before I jump right into it actually I don't even want to wait Oh Oh, too, hot yeah, I mean It's kind of good, but I'm not gonna lie to you It kind of tastes like plastic and like I can't decide which one it tastes more like but it's not bad like it's definitely not The worst thing I've ever had does it deserve the hype. Hell. No this is not life-changing I don't think it's worth four dollars and forty-five cents, but No, I'm gonna try to say something positive about this because I feel like I'm being too negative I need to start understanding that not everything tastes like a nice almond milk latte so I think that they got the flavor of Pumpkin spice down really well like it genuinely tastes like pumpkin spice, which I think is impressive to a certain extent So I'll give them that the thing that I was worried about was it being too sweet is it too sweet No, I do not think it's too sweet I actually think it's a decent amount of sweetness which is impressive to me so Starbucks Good on you because normally flavored lattes taste like blended up fairy. Dust like it's so fine sweet so out of ten I think I would give it about a six. Let me explain myself I couldn't really like taste all of the spices I can taste the Nutmeg I can taste the cinnamon I can taste what I don't know whatever I can taste all the different spices and would I get it again? No, I wouldn't and I'm gonna stick to ice on the nova lattes from now on, but I'm glad that I tried it I'm glad that I know now. I finally feel like a basic white girl for once You know I've never really fit the stereotype I'm probably not gonna drink any more of it because it kind of makes me feel like I want to throw up Let's go to the mall. Let's get some shoes, okay I know I already finished talking about this earlier But just a cute little side note they put little nutmeg sprinkle in or something or cinnamon or pumpkin spice Oh, it's probably just pumpkin spice, okay Well, they put a little pumpkin spice sprinkling on the top, and I think that's a really cute addition So do you know what Starbucks at least you did that I think that's really cute and generous I guess and it's a nice little touch, but I mean it still doesn't taste that great, but still I'm Just finished at the mall, I'm sweating profusely, but I'll clean that later good news and bad news We'll start with the bad news so the bad news is they didn't have my size in the shoes that I wanted they literally had A seven and a half, and I'm a seven, which is you know what it wasn't meant to be you know what I mean So that's fine The good news is is that I ended up buying other things because I have no self-control So from forever21 which is the first place? I went to I got two pairs of sunglasses because I'm addicted to sunglasses first ones I got were just these black ones cuz I literally don't own black sunglasses They just look like this and the next ones. I got are not really sunglasses, but they're fun They're just these blue like aviator things. I literally love colored glasses They're my addiction in life, and these blue ones were just too cute not to get and they're so cheap They're like eight dollars each the last thing. I got were pants from brandy melville They're brandy melville, but I got them from Nordstrom Nordstrom has like a brandy section or whatever okay? Let me tell you a quick little story so I was in Nordstrom and I was trying on the pants And I really liked them I was like those are really cute, but then I was thinking about it, and I was like well I really wear those and probably not you know they're a little bit wild they're a little crazy They're kind of out of my comfort zone even though I don't really have a comfort zone when it comes to clothing just because I don't give a fuck But I was like you know I don't know if I'll get a lot of use out of those Wow oh my god, I just hit myself in the head that is an all-time low and that really hurt okay anyway I really like the pants But they ended up leaving and walking out of the store cuz I was like you know what probably not gonna wear these I could spend the money on something else. I'll just leave and not get them and I was okay with the decision I was like you know what that's fine. I'm almost to my car Maybe 500 feet away from my car And I feel my pocket and my wallet is not in my pocket so I was like okay well I can't get into my car because my keys are in my wallet And I can't not go back and get it because I have my credit card in there. It was yeah I couldn't just not go get it so I go to Every single store that I went to I ended up finally going to Nordstrom I went to every single other store before I went to North strim which was stupid I was so stressed out I was like there's no way that someone found it. It definitely is gone forever. I was pissed. I was sad I was like you know what today sucks I went to the front desk at Nordstrom, and I was like did you guys happen to find a wallet? And they had my wallet hallelujah, I was pumped, but while I was in north strum I was like you know what this is a sign. This is a sign I need those pants because something in this universe brought me back to the Nordstrom store part of it was to get my wallet But there must have been another reason and that reason must have been for me to buy these Pants so I ended up getting the pants, and I'm pretty pumped about it I already I'm excited to wear them, so I'm glad that I got them and everything happens for a reason I literally have back sweat right now because I was so stressed out my pumpkin spice latte is cold. Oh my god I shouldn't have done that I think that's it for today's vlog it literally consisted of like three days worth of footage That's a first. I usually don't do that, but I mean I hope you guys enjoyed it Anyways, if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want I love you guys so much appreciate every single one of you, and I can't wait to see you guys next time"

Check out his channel!! - https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-09-19T21:41:01Z,78303,1879797,2593,"Oh Didn't see you there Good afternoon if it's not afternoon where you live I don't care try to name one event that's going on in the world right now that everybody's instagramming about, tweeting about, talking about, Bragging about, live-streaming about, facebooking about, myspacing about. Okay, you get the idea What event do you think this is what's the first one that pops into your mind? New York Fashion Week every single social media has been completely Dominated by posts for New York Fashion Week, and it really got me thinking. I'm kind of sad I'm not there. I feel like I'm missing out like everybody's posting about it Everyone's having the time of their lives wearing cool outfits and sh*t, and I'm sitting at home looking like a raisin bagel You know what I mean, so what do I do when the world doesn't let me have what I want I make it myself. In today's video I decided that it would be a good idea if I try to remake some of these outfits at home Number one I'd look dope as fuck number two, I'm like I'm at the New York Fashion Week walking down the runway Strutting my stuff. I'm a little bit short, so the runway is not in my future That's for sure, but if I dress up in these outfits and just walk in a straight line What's the difference? If you want to experience New York Fashion Week in the comfort of your own home as well I'm about to teach you how. I dug through the internet, and I found about 10 outfits that I thought were absolutely spectacular. I'm hoping that maybe through this video if the owner of New York Fashion Week or whoever runs it or whatever sees this video Maybe next year they can invite me And I can sit in the audience with Kanye West and judge all the outfits like an entitled bitch First outfit we're looking at here as you can see it's just this white fluffy sort of square looking outfit. personally I think that this one is really cool I think it has a lot of personality, and I think it really creates a vibe here I don't know exactly what kind of vibe it creates But I just think it's a good one the way that her body looks 10 times its normal size Really speaks modern it really speaks I'm different I'm actually gonna want to start out by putting my hair into a nice slicked-back pony okay So now that I look like a librarian You're gonna want to take this thing And you're gonna want to put it behind your shoulders so you're just gonna want to drape it over *disapointed noises* Last thing you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to take some tape Okay hold on do you want let's do this little bit differently? Now it's time to take the tape and You're finished So this is the completed look as you can see if it's really quick and easy and it only took me like literally five minutes to do and it looks great Next alpha we have was worn by v1 in the only Kim Kardashian, aka My mother as you can see she just has this nice little kind of clear sheer looking outfit thing going on here black stripes Going over it and when I saw this. I immediately knew that this would be something I needed to wear myself It's such a simple look, but it really packs a punch you know I'm a badass bitch my clothes are see-through and I'm Kim Kardashian That's what this look says to me And I thought you know what let's do it so for this outfit all you're gonna need is a plastic bag and black tape take Your plastic bag cut out a hole for your head and then both of your arms of course you can't forget about your arms those Are very important you're just gonna want to take your black tape Apparently, I don't have a lot of black tape with me This is all I have but that's fine because we're gonna make it work um okay so I didn't have enough tape to cover the entire thing so this is all I got but you know what it's all that the Thought that counts and it's just reframing the basic idea Next we have this outfit, I first saw it and I was like okay I don't know how to feel about this I might have nightmares about it, but I might not so I took that little ounce of possibility But then I wouldn't have nightmares about it and I decided you know what let's Recreate it so the next outfit is a little bit more complex than the last two, but I believe in us we can do this We have to somehow make the bottom half of this sort of outfit Take your tutu basically what I would recommend is just to see this thing right here. Just tape it on easy as pie Let's put this on real quick so far this looks pretty good but we can't forget the model has some sort of rapid e-wrap thing around their face, so To do that we need to use some toilet paper, I'm pretty sure most people have toilet paper at their house So I doubt this will be an issue Okay, so this is the finished look. I think it looks great. I think I nailed it honestly I think that this one looks almost the exact same as the model Next one features my favorite color right now, which is yellow the way that her hair is completely Glued back to her head it just frames her shaped like a glove I just think that this outfit is beautiful and flawless in all ways I thought that it would be something that I would love to recreate and I'd love to sport in my everyday life and that's simply what I'm gonna do is to start out you're gonna want to put your hair into a nice low ponytail and you're Gonna want to take a big yellow t-shirt sweatshirt on up something in the store and put that on once that that's on you're gonna Want to take something that's like a black long sleeve Okay, just stick with me here. I know this is weird Just like the model. It's a little bit uncomfortable, but it doesn't look too shabby So let's keep going next as you can see her lower half her body is very thick there must be something in there filling things Up so have no fear. There is a way that we can do this I'm gonna be using just random pieces of clothing And I'm gonna be shoving them under this and then I'm gonna cinch it with about you will see let's get into it I'm just gonna shove it under and then I'm going to be taking this belt And I'm just gonna cinch around my waist actually this belts too small for this And we're just gonna want to kind of fold the sweatshirt over the belt so that you can't see it anymore And it just looks like the others nice Next we have this outfit that really brings me back to my childhood we have on the top We have these beautiful beautiful Beanie babies which are just an iconic stuffed animal and on the bottom We have some jean shorts that have studs in colors and things all over It's a really clean and polished outfit And I just thought you know what let's do it because I have a lot of stuffed animals at my house and this would be An easy one to recreate so okay, so the next one includes a little bit of DIY So let's just prepare ourselves here Basically all you're gonna want to do is just line up your stuffed animals on the shirt feel free to arrange them however you please it's all about personal preference all you're gonna want to do is just take this and just Tape them all to the shirt basically how to just strap them on as best as you can have fun with it You know don't be too hard on yourself. Just do your best here even if it's a little bit droopy. That is okay It's the best that you could do all you have to do is do your best Next we have this really sleek kind of outfit that I feel like would have been worn nice 70 years ago But we're gonna ditch the stripes And we're just gonna focus more on the headpiece take another plastic bag and cut out head armholes You know you know the deal It's time to take a shower cap and just put that on your head And that is literally it that is the only thing you have to do for this outfit plastic bag Shower cap on the head, and you literally little by your freaking run ristar This one might have to be my favorite look of the entire thing this guy is killing it. He is straight-up killing it I mean like he's starting out strong with the denim on denim That is a very bold move in fashion, but it's very trendy right now, and he has just done it He's basically naked so that's really cool. I saw this and I knew I needed to make it I knew that I needed to I was a must in my life. I needed to okay I am so ecstatic for this next outfit So first if you have a tan shirt Just put that on now that I have this tan shirt on it's time to just put on the denim jacket so so far this Is pretty simple right pretty simple pretty easy nothing too crazy now you might be like wait Emma You're literally ruining a nice pair of jeans I'm not even mad that I have to cut them because that's their main purpose in life is for this outfit perfect as you can See, this is a very easy look to recreate and I basically look exactly like the model Okay, we're almost reaching the end here, but the main thing. I thought I was looking out with this outfit Was mainly the bag on the head I know that a lot of you will be like that's kind of weird look I don't like that No, no, no, you don't understand for me personally if we can make having a bag on your head a fashionable thing I would love that Think about this you have a rash or something on your face You accidentally shaved your eyebrow in the shower one day on accident something bad happens to your face? And you don't know what to do put a bag on your head simple as that as long as you don't suffocate It's a good time. Okay, so the last outfit is super easy and simple. I just have this navy blue dunder-mifflin shirt here I just put it on backwards and then the last thing you're gonna want to do is find a white bag and just put it Over your head, so let me find a white bag somewhere I don't know if I even have one okay, I could not find a white bag anywhere so instead I'm just going to be using this Lululemon bag, and I'm just gonna shove it over my head It was that easy is that simple and with this outfit you can wear any pants because as you can see in the photo There's no pants included, so I'm just gonna continue to wear these pants, and I think that it'll agree That's it for today's video if you recreate these outfits, please let me know somehow I mean honestly you should because why wouldn't you if you liked this video give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down Below anything you want I love you all so much appreciate every single last one of you You"

Starting my day I haven't done anything yet. I didn't even eat breakfast. Right now i'm driving to get coffee.

It's kind of fun to like go and wait in the line and then order your drink and then get it and then you know drink it. It's like, I don't know it's like a little reward slash treat and I think it's fun. What the actual hell are you doing. I don't know what the fuck this person is trying to do but it's not allowed. Then after that gonna go to the Gym for a little bit but i'm not gonna vlog that because as I've said every single time in, my entire life that I've ever vlogged.

It's Emma and today I'm back with another video. so in today's video I'm going to be doing my third Q&A. I'm excited about it. I asked you guys for some quote-unquote ""weird questions"", and you guys really pulled through. Ok so something kind of funny happened, when I was looking through my DMs, looking for questions for this video No joke, 50% of my questions had something to do with toes. So I'm gonna go through a few of those and answer them, but I can't answer all of them because there was literally, I am not even kidding, a hundred questions just about toes. I don't know????? First question, which toe is the longest? Okay. My left big toe is the biggest toe, so, you're welcome! If you had to eat one of your toes, which one would it be? Definitely one of my pinky toes, because it's the smallest so it wouldn't, like, affect me that much. I don't think. Maybe it would, I don't know. Would you rather suck toes or eat fingernails. Every once in a while when I get kind of nervous, I like bite my nails. I don't really bite them a lot, but sometimes I do so I'd say eat fingernails because when you bite your nails You kind of eat the fingernails in a way, so do you suck toes and earlobes no sometimes your lobes? What's your favorite finger and toe fingers? Favorite toe would have to be my biggest toe I don't know. what if one of your toes could perfectly fit snug into one of your nostrils hold on a sec oh Oh my god, that was gross like that was league level League I'm so sorry. I might even cut that out like that was horrible, okay I think we need to move on because it's getting a little bit too weird, and I don't want to scare you guys away so
favorite city Definitely England. If you have to choose one person to live with for the rest of your life who would it be dead or alive? famous or a friend I'm very excited for the day that I get to live alone because I love being alone so uh probably just myself But it would be really fun to live with my friends one day, then I'm older we can have a trap house You know it would be a little time so maybe first kiss story oh Yeah, no. I'll totally tell you I'm gonna tell you right now hold on a sec Let me just I just have to like um do something real quick and then I'll come back And I'll tell you the story hold on a second Okay, so normally. I don't tell this story But I guess I can tell it too because I don't know like I want to you know be real with you guys one day Me and my friend who's a boy his name is Sammy. He was at my house. We're just hanging out You know his friends. It was like no big deal nobody It was not even a big deal like it was just as friends I think he had a huge crush on me like it was obvious like he really did have a huge crush on me like there's No doubt about it He was trying to make a move, and I was just like no Sammy like seriously stop like seriously stop I know you want me But you have to hold back Try to like control yourself like I just want to be friends like I don't want to be anything more one thing led to another And he is just he is really going for it. He's really working hard He's really trying to just smooch my lips, and I was just like you know what fine I was like you're not sure why not you know what why not That's how happen news really magical sparks were flying anyway thousand story, moving on. Do penguins have knees Well, I don't know would you rather have lukewarm coffee for the rest of your life Or have to listen to look at what you made me do every time you drink your iced coffee I don't know. What look what you made me do is so I need to google it real quick Oh, it's the new Taylor Swift song. Let's listen to this. I haven't even heard this yet What the what is this? Yeah, what's your favorite pizza topping to be completely honest? I'm probably gonna get hate for this actually like definitely gonna get hate it on for this, but my favorite pizza topping is olives. Okay. It's really fucking good, and if you want to hate on me I don't freaking care because I really like that they've always like that since I was a young. Does your poop come out differently when you drink more coffee than normal If you could use one emoji for everything which one would it be? Because it just relates to everything but I also really like the eggplant emoji Because even though I don't like eggplant I still think it's very useful So what is your least favorite part about showering? Showering to me is a waste of time the amount of time that it takes a shower There's so many things that I could have been doing in that time and like everything else about it I'm like why I feel after I shower. I like the feeling of being clean That's just it like it takes so much time usually a shower about once a month and just hope for the best Scrunch your fold. I'm assuming you're talking about toilet paper definitely fold because I'm not an out-of-control bitch Would you rather show your butt to the world or never drink coffee again? If you were type of underwear what type would you be definitely tighty whities because I don't know I just think tighty whities have a lot of personality They're really cute and fun just like me so I love tighty whities if you were a candle What kind of sec would you be so when I was in like seventh grade? I saw this candle that was mint chocolate flavored, and it was literally the best smelling candle. I have ever smelled in my life I might still have it. I'm now after to see if I can find it. Oh my god Oh, so he was like mint chocolate flavored or something macaroon. I don't know okay, so I found it It's the mint chocolate candle it stopped burning it at one point because I was like it smells so good I want to savor it for the rest of my life. Oh It smells like a thin mint kind of so good. I oh my god I don't even like candles like they're cool But like I don't care about them that much with this candle it blows me away every time I hope that they sell that this season cuz I'm literally gonna order like 15 of them anyways Are you ready for the Fitnessgram Pacer test you can never be ready for the Pacer test. It's like a proven fact You just can never be ready. It's so There's no way to prepare while you'll get that one kid in your group That's like super good at soccer can literally run for like five hours on end and like never gets tired well I always was the one who got in the group of that kid and then I'd always try to like beat them and it would Just feel like they were like chillin, and I would just be dying by like the 20th round and okay anyway Have you ever kissed your cat dog? No I mean like probably once like on accident like I never That's just like gross cuz like dog germs and cat germs on your face like that's so gross if you had to choose to go To either New York Fashion Week or Coachella for the rest of your life, which would you choose? 120 percent Coachella my dream in life is to go to Coachella everything about it seems so cool such good food I love Palm Springs, Palm Springs is dope I love the clothes and I love the music there It's Coachella like the New York Fashion Week really confuses me if you like the outfits are just they're so Complex and crazy, then I just can't even comprehend What's going on? If I was like sitting there watching like the fashion show I feel like I laugh because some of those outfits are so fucking weird I don't know what I do with myself. What's one thing that would be really cool. If you could just change the color of it The ocean go to the ocean, and it's orange that I'd be so freakin cool, but I'm not talking about just like adult orange I'm going about like bright highlighter orange. How many toothbrushes have you gone through in your life like zero? I don't really brush my teeth I think that's a waste of time along with showering. Kiss marry kill: Cole Sprouse, Justin Bieber, Zac Efron. kill Zac Efron. Efron if you're watching this do not hate me I didn't even really like High School Musical as a young person like I think I like it more now that I'm older so Efron you gotta go. definitely kiss Justin Bieber I don't know He's just he has so much swag like definitely marry Cole Sprouse because I would love to marry him just because of his tweets he Has the best Twitter, but I also was a huge Suite Life of Zack & Cody fan He's also beautiful, but whatever so not to be creepy or anything like don't take this the wrong way But like what's your favorite candy an why? I'd say my favorite candy would have to be my homemade peanut butter cups if you want the recipe to those I'll leave The link in the description because they're really good and also they're not like that sweet so I can eat 100 of them and not Get sick of it, so that's great show us the weirdest picture on your camera roll and don't explain it Sorry, how do you keep your hair so pretty and healthy by the way. I love you You're the best you're the best the way that I keep my hair, so healthy is that I wash it Maybe once a month it gets damaged because like I never do anything to it I also don't brush it ever cuz brushing your hair wasted time washing your hair waste of time showering and   washing hair What even is that this is 2017 you can do whatever you want? You don't need to wash your hair I mean if I'm busy like what's the point? You know what is something? That's really popular now, but in five years. Everyone will look back on and be embarrassed by Don't know it's really hard I can't really I can't think of anything at the moment. If coffee didn't exist what would you drink on a daily basis my tears? Would you ever date a guy who genuinely thinks that he is a vampire and wears fangs? But it's also really cute and sweet by the way. I love your videos. Love you girl Honestly for sure don't judge a book by his cover He thinks that he's a vampire? But maybe he'll treat you right and guys that treat. You right is very rare these days honestly I would definitely take vampire guy over some sort of bag. You know what I mean I don't know vampires are cool right I mean like everybody was obsessed with Edward Cullen or whatever that guy was from Twilight I never even saw the Twilight movies But like there must be something good about vampires that I'm not fully aware of. Do you like fries with mayo no I? Hate mayonnaise I hate it, it's the worst condiment 100% the worst condiment. I absolutely despise it. I will never eat it It scares me it jiggles. It's white it looks like marshmallow fluff. That's gone bad Everybody always like tries to make me eat it like they're like no Emma you'll like it But I hate it favorite type of pasta. I like penne, but I also like this kinds It's like a spiral a little bit I think bowties can be kind of fun sometimes two pastas pasta, and it all kind of tastes the same But it doesn't exactly taste the same. I literally feel like penne tastes different than like bowtie pasta thoughts on twins double the fun If you could marry a food, which one would you pick besides an almond milk latte? You know what I wouldn't mind spending my life in dedicating myself to peanut butter at a movie theater Which armrest is yours both? This is why nobody likes to go to the movies with me? Would you ever consider surfing as a profession surfing is my profession? What are your thoughts on? Lamps, or are you more of a ceiling fan type of gal in the houses that I've lived in throughout my life I've actually never had a ceiling fan in my house, so I don't even know I've never experienced a ceiling fan I've always had to use those weak little fans that you can like set up or whatever and they don't even work And you're still freaking hot when you use anyway so probably I'm more of a lamp kind of gal Just cuz like I use lamps all the time very helpful so can you try to drink coffee without your lips touching the straw let's try it out I Wouldn't do that again Would you rather throw at yourself a glass of water while your fully clothed or sing the rest of your life the Martinez Rose part in its everyday bro hold up hold up, can we switch language? we bout to hit it amwdwkinoicaowmnc awndoainwodaow ajwndonaofpwke *Emma trying to rap spanish* I can't speak sandwich. I almost said I can't I almost just said I can't speak sandwich I meant to say I can't speak Spanish so like I literally cannot sing this because it's too fast And I just like can't do it, so that's that can you put your Gucci shirt for sale as merch honestly I would the only problem is is that I'd probably get sued so do you like squash? NO. I do not like squash. squash is my least favorite vegetable. I absolutely despise squash. It's so gross It's always the vegetable when you get like a side of veggies at like a restaurant And you just like pick those out because that's just gross. I don't like squash It's soggy and slimy and I'm not a fan favorite. Type of melon 100% cantaloupe. Honeydew is a waste of space It's just another one of those things that no one likes you get a side of fruit at a restaurant and you pick out all Of the honeydew, it's just what you do. You don't it's gross cantaloupe on the other hand if you get a good cantaloupe, holy Cantaloupe can be so fucking good handle up is delicious.

We Literally Couldn't even stay there I can't see shit Tomorrow we're going back to that same Location even though it's like two hours away and we're doing the shoot again I have all my Outfits packed and I think it's gonna be a Great time That's that i don't even know if you can see me right now cuz It's really dark. I'm with my friends and we're having a slumber party but we just wrote a rap I'm gonna go perform it at like the local stage near where my house is I'm about to perform it for you. Let's go (Dances like a BOSS or whateva) (keeps dancing like a clown then *dabs*) (what is she even doing?) mom on my d*ck, yo she cookin' I can't do this okay i'm sorry guys, like I really I got stage fright once I got up there, like I just couldn't do it but like you'll hear it one day okay i'm blocking the Phone Number but literally we Just found this note That says ""I lost my Fitbit at school if you find it please give It back and then there's a thirty dollar reward so I'm no joke about to find this sh*t because i need 30 bucks. A lot of people like to say that timer cam is overrated. I completely disagree 2017 the year of timer cam (they cool or whateva) (this is getting out of hand LITERALLY) I literally have to pee and I just found this Porta Potty. Oh My God Guys I'm no joke I'm going to use it i'm literally gonna use it. We were just walking around we found, we found this Beemer and then we're like Who's the owner and then We Found out that it's this guy. It's me All you guys are Sarah suck it made on a vlog before you okay i'm uncomfortable. Don't know what's going on. (has an intimate staring contest) I feel dead because I'm very tired But I'm gonna show you my outfit anyways. These necklaces that are from Stargaze Jewelry then I have this shirt that Says Frisco on it that I thrifted and then Cropped. Then I have these white Jeans from Pacsun and then I have white leather Converse that are very dirty and need to be washed. I'm very excited about It, I really need some coffee but No
Good coffee places are open so we have to wait. I'm not okay Lilly's having one of these but i don't really like these very much. Okay, well that's your opinion so... Its too early. I know. Okay well now we have to find another gas station. hehe hoooooooooooooooooo and there goes all of our money that we could just spend on coffee and there it goes all on gas. hahaha, so fun $29.99 they couldn't have rounded up to 30 for us. Are you okay? Are you okay? no Are you okay? No So, If we die Sorry I don't know. It's so foggy right now but, it's okay. Oh my god this looks like a horror movie I'm literally waiting for Slender Man to pop out at any f-cking time   We smell a skunk smell. Meaning that there's a skunk around here and that means that we could get sprayed at any moment. It's Crazy Crazy time. Oh my god, oh my god. I don't know if you can see this but there's literally a cross right here I literally feel like I'm in a scary movie. We don't even know pictures are gonna work but It doesn't matter because it's gonna be fun Anyways. Also, our next location is good too so it doesn't matter. We just have bad luck with fog but that's how it works when you're in San Francisco It's not windy so we can actually tolerate it and therefore it's actually kind of fun That is not a raspberry, that is a Blackberry. Don't eat it. Why? You could. cuz I'm scared. I don't care... I'll just have one of the little balls. No, someone probably pooped on it or something. Reem it's all the way up here, no one pooped on it. Is a Raspberry I'm not stupid It's a Blackberry Lily that's a Blackberry Taste it, taste it Wow, you're both gonna die and then I'm gonna be alive. That's a Blackberry Lily F-ck you I don't eat blackberries I wouldn't know. Were all gonna die One, Two, Three, Four, Five Literally there's Banana Slugs everywhere. They're infesting the area and we need to evacuate immediately Because they're extremely dangerous and poisonous. Just Kidding Look at this house it's Completely black. We're really hungry because we haven't eaten breakfast yet and I haven't had coffee. A.k.a I'm dying right now. We're literally so lost That we're resorting to teleporting 1, 2, 3, Ahhh Oh my god yes. We found her car. Let's get food. Yes, yes oh my god I've never Been happier to be in a car in my life. We got a little bit dirty running around in the woods I literally have dirt all over my freaking legs and I put on my slippers Because I brought them. We're going to get food right now so i'm like, you know what, frick this I'm not gonna wear cute clothes My feet frickin hurt hella bad I just put on my frickin slippers and I feel great Can you get your cold brew sweetened ?

People in there, they didn't approve. Quote on quote, ""What is this world come to? This girl has the word frick on her sweatshirt i'm offended."" Lilly's obsessed with his dog. Please put in the Mario Brothers thing on that. So we were gonna go to this one place called Za Z's but It doesn't open till 9:00 and it's 8:15 so we're like, You know what we're gonna go somewhere else. So right now we're going to a place called 1428 Haight No, not 4:20 Lilly. Get your mind out of the gutter. I have my coffee and I'm feeling better, but i also have to sh*t so I'm hungry! How did we completely go the wrong way? We are here. Let's go guys. I hope it's good. So we just went into that place 1428 Haight and we just didn't really like how it looked so we're gonna drive to another place now but, we literally Have until noon until we can go to our next location because it's really foggy right now so, you have to wait for the fog to blow over So we're going to our third Brunch location of the day. I think this one's gonna be the one. Me when it's too foggy for pictures. I just walked in and they're playing Tame Impala and i'm so happy. I'm sweating. Let me try.

Last time we were here we couldn't see the beach This time we can see the beach. It's also not very windy so this is much more manageable but, it's gonna be okay. The view was pretty and I thought that they were prettier. Did you guys like that? You know what? It was better than last time. One day we're gonna come back here and it won't be foggy. But every time we come it gets a little bit better so Think we're on the on the road to true happiness and satisfaction. But now you best believe that I need another freaking coffee.

My name is Emma Okay, and today has been very mediocre for me today is kind of sucked for me I decided that to try and make things better, I would make myself cookies So in this video, I'm going to be making some healthy Fun-loving vegan gluten-free cookies, and I'm really excited about it I hope that this can turn my day around. Maybe if you make these at home And if you're having a bad day it can turn your day around too. I'm a little bit pumped about it. I've never made this recipe before. I found it on Pinterest And I'm just ready to hop right into it so I have to get all my ingredients and then we can begin I'm gonna try to do the thing where you like snap and then Everything I'll have all the ingredients You know okay? Wasn't that cute? first step preheat oven to 365 or no 350. I don't know where I got 365 from Ew this literally what is Ew Don't know what this is, but it does not look healthy ...eww That's kind of disturbing if anybody knows what palm shortening does to cookies let me know I mean, I'm assuming it makes it moist moist moist moist moist But I have no clue Okay, that's fine Sorry, I'm not I haven't really been talking a lot because I'm so focused no no no this looks not good What the f-  okay this does not look right? Why is there chunks in this coconut milk? I've never experienced something like this could it be bad When's the expiration date, this looks rotten? Do you know what, I don't care. Maybe it's just chunky today a little bit worried. Noooo It's so chunky! Dang it! Okay, so if you're wondering what's in here so far we have vanilla, coconut sugar, palm shortening, and coconut milk. Ah sorry I haven't really been oh, that's bad. That's really bad. Okay. I already this up didn't take long I'm supposed to use a hand mixer to mix all this up But the problem is that I don't and make sure at my house cuz I don't know I don't bake a lot I'm basically supposed to imitate a hand mixer with my own hand so I don't know how I'm gonna do this? Okay, so I have a whisk and hand mixers are really really fast, so I'm gonna have to do this super fast so hold on No! No okay, I'm a little bit, I need to be creative here My oven is preheating okay, that's good at least something's going okay. Oh my god I really do need a hand mixer for this, but I literally don't own a hand mixer, so I don't know what to do I'm have to mix it from out here This is like the most workout I've ever gotten in my life look how disgusting that looks somebody explain to me Why this looks like chicken? I thought these were supposed to be vegan Let me wash my hands because I'm not trying to get germs all over my cookies. I was literally the first time I've washed my hands in like a year. I don't know if it's helping I just need to mix as fast as I possibly can for the next 60 seconds. Keep going, I can't stop. Three, two, one Literally so tired my arm is burning thirty more seconds Ten nine eight seven six Five four three two one. Yes. Oh my god. I'm so excited right now it worked If you're a home right now, and you're making this and you don't own a hand mixer Don't even stress because I just did that all by myself with just my freaking hands Usually when things make a mess that means that they're gonna be worth it add dry ingredients and mix on medium speed I don't own a hand mixer this entire recipe revolves around a hand mixer, and I don't own a hand mixer So like I just have to mix vigorously with my own hand and just like hope that it can imitate the machine But that's just a lot to ask and like it's really hard So I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do it But I don't care two cups of almond flour down the hatchet. This bowl is way too small okay We need to move into a bigger bowl This is gonna work better Perfect Frick my hands are really dirty, but I need to look at my phone So I'm gonna mix, this as vigorously as I can for one minute Just like I did last time one minute on the clock. Let's go okay three two one my arm This one's even harder than the last one Okay, that's it. Okay, so now. I have to fold in some chocolate chips, which is the best part? But the thing is I don't have chocolate chips So I'm going to take a bar chocolate and like cut it up and then I'll have Chocolate Chunk cookies So do you know what these aren't chocolate chip cookies these are Chocolate Chunk cookies, and it's actually a really big difference So please don't make the mistake okay, so I have some vegan dark chocolate here, and I'm just gonna cut it up I don't even know how to do this, okay Oh You know it would have been a lot easier to buy the chocolate chips, but I forgot so paying the price now Do you know what this is actually kind of fun not gonna lie kind of feel like the Barefoot Contessa right now Feeling some Gordon Ramsay vibes feeling some Bobby Flay vibes right now This is just something that I feel like they would do I don't know chocolate chips are so overrated everyone uses chocolate chips these days. It's like no one Appreciates a nice chocolate chunk, so I'm really glad that I could bring it back I mean if you're at home and you're making this consider chocolate chunks instead because I feel like this is so much more intimate Great, I think that's about good This dough is vegan meaning that I can eat it, and I won't get salmonella, so I'm pretty excited about it No one can yell at me now this can make you sick suckers okay, be right back I'm gonna clean up my workspace because it's giving me anxiety. This is literally a mess I'm just gonna take some fat spoonfuls and just kind of hope for the best here a pet peeve is when you're making cookies and then while they're baking they like Spread out a bunch kind of all melt into like one big cookie I don't know if you know what I'm talking about, but that's like my literal in life long story short I really don't want about to happen with these I would be extremely upset if it did I'm gonna pop these in the oven so BRB I'm not gonna. Let it go to waste. I feel like I'm gonna vomit Yeah They're huge, I did not expect them to be this large, but I don't care I'm not opposed to large servings, but also I'm not sure if they're cooked all the way through Okay, we'll see two hours later, so I let them sit for a little bit, and they're cool now So it's time to try it out the moment that we've all been waiting for they look like pancakes because they're so thin But it's all about the flavors, so let's just try it out, okay That kind of sucks you know what okay? Is it great is it the best cooking I've ever had No, is it edible sure it's edible. I wouldn't say it's great I wouldn't really say make these at home Considering that these are supposed to be healthy I guess they're not that bad look at what happens when I try to pick it out Yeah, it still tastes okay, when I make them again probably not, but at the end of the day despite all my hardships It was overall a fun thing to make and you know what that's what life's all about It's not it. Doesn't always need to be perfect. It. Just needs to be fun because today for me with hey I know I've said that like eight times, but I just want to reiterate making these cookies helped relieve some of my stress I don't have any regrets if you like this video give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything that you Want I love you all so so much and appreciate every small one of you.

✭ Wildflower Cases (not spons, i just love their cases):  https://www.wildflowercases.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwlrnNBRBMEiwApKU4PLfim8eP31SjQRvKxs93cYmIuTHk5TwuN3_IySJxNV42r_Ha2HmGdRoCWz4QAvD_BwE",2017-09-07T19:57:23Z,162800,4749025,4497,what's up guys it's Emma I'm gonna be doing a what's on my iPhone video today the apps that I have on my phone are probably exactly the same as what you have on your phone but I thought it'd be fun anyways you know maybe I have a few apps that you don't have and then you can download them or something I don't know okay I don't really know the point of this video also if you're wondering why I have a bunch of courts everywhere it's because I don't understand technology and I'm trying to figure out how to screen record so that I can be all cute and have you know my screen next to me so I'm overcompensating by using a ton of chords that I don't need okay anyway let's get right into it I should probably sit like towards this side so that you can like see the screen right here I don't know how to do this I'm not good at this okay ow I have the iPhone 7 plus in black probably don't care but whatever my phone case is from wildflower cases I'll leave the link down below not sponsored or anything I just love their cases they're pretty cool as you can see we have this homescreen my notes about narcissistic to have a photo of yourself is your lockscreen but I just thought that I looked really good in this every single iPhone has these applications so we don't need to go over that cuz that's just stupid so let's go to the page that actually matters which is the page with all of my apps so everybody has the same exact apps so like hopefully you won't click off of this video and get bored you can just look at your own phone and see this exact same thing but I don't care I personally like to organize everything in two folders if you don't like to do that well then shame on you because it makes things a lot more organized in fun so that's how I do that first folder is called gotta be pop in 24/7 this folder basically is all about me just being pop in 24/7 you know first app that I have as you can see it's facetune you know a lot of people use it just a little bit like you know just to cover as a tour - but I personally like to kind of go hard when I use this app this is one that I was previously edited I'm considering posting it but I don't know yet still letting it kind of process I don't personally use pictures from my camera roll I just like take a picture right on the spot to use so okay I'm just trying to find my good selfie angle hold on the first thing I like to do is whiten my teeth because girl you best believe my teeth are yellow because I drink so much coffee melons skin is perfect so you have to do what you have to do so I just smooth out my entire face I don't want to see anything I don't want to see a freckle I don't want to see as the smoothing quality kind of takes away all sense of shadow and/or depth and it kind of makes you look like an anime character and I love it as we know I'm not the most gifted when it comes to makeup so I like to add in my highlight later just like really load it up you know what no Who am I kidding haben so next I added vibrance all over myself let makes me look tan and stuff like that um we're done the next app I use is called cut and paste app do you know why I'm not gonna explain I'm just gonna show you it'll make a little bit more sense so that's what I use that app for the next folder we have is a plant don't ask any more questions please um so the first thing I have is called farmers only I actually don't have an account yet Barbara lover no no no do you know what I need to be more creative what if farmers like tractor tomato that seems about right I'm not actually a farmer full name none of your business oh my god I'm so excited enjoy long walks to the soil section of Home Depot and large and bountiful dinners consisting of bone marrow and apples and sometimes cow manure gonna add some photos perfect I'd be really surprised if people didn't want to date me I mean I really would be surprised I really would I'll let you know if I find a date um I'll keep you guys updated next I have this thing called virtual boyfriend because I'm really lonely and guys don't like me so I have to do this okay new game oh this is fun rebel 5 funny one healthy one sensitive 5 attentive 3 smart one feminine 5 wealthy one 5 caring 2 charisma moon one describe your physical characteristics haircolor red complexion laughs err appearance how do you look urban casual simple take the same thing ooh bad boy five funny one who cares if they're funny right healthy and don't care affectionate five responsible don't care about that next smart one caring one wealthy wealthy masculine masculine sexy five [ __ ] physical features any any any do you know what I don't discriminate a boys of bullying oh my God look so excited to do this okay you know what I'll give him a chance hey I'm lonely are your parents beavers cuz damn oh this is the first time that guys ever hit on me I'm very confused and I don't know what to do what am i say what did I do he's laughing what the [ __ ] is he doing what the [ __ ] is he doing are we dancing together I don't know give Z virus whoo oh my god I just made him sick okay do you want you know this is my first time using this app and I'm probably not gonna use it again just kidding I probably gonna use it for the rest of my life because this is the best it's gonna ever get but anyway so the last thing I have it in my eggplant folder is this mean thing because basically let's say you're texting a guy which never happens to meet you're texting them things are going well but things kind of get a little bit awkward and you know you don't really know to say you're like you know I'm lost I think everything's going well but I'm not so sure send a frickin meme and June what's even better send a meme that you made because that shows that your original shows that your creative shows your funny shows that your cute it shows that you're awesome and it shows that you like memes and that's the most important thing okay you have a sexy oh my freaking God I literally just made a great ass meme I can guarantee it's gonna do good things for me I just know it next got games the first game I have is called best fiends plot twist I'm not sponsored by best fiends they've never contacted me because I'm a new youtuber and they know that you know what I just downloaded this app because every single youtuber on this entire platform has been sponsored by best fiends and I want to know what it's all about so let's see what's going on here I don't know to do okay so this is basically just candy crush but worse that was it that was it did I really just win that level that easily no I don't like this game okay over it so next I have this game called pimple popper and it's because I love popping zits so much and sometimes I run out as its to pop on my own head so I have to resort to this app which is fine um this app will not work with future versions of iOS the developer of this app needs to update it to improve it I guess this happy isn't gonna work on my phone and I'm extremely unhappy literally what the hell doesn't work anymore with my iOS and do you know why I don't even know what that means okay I don't understand anything about that too much technology for my little brain next we have fat beef Abbi bird because I used to play flappy bird you know back in the day and most people kind of gone over it they're like yeah flappy bird whatever that's not the thing of the past but it really isn't a thing of the past for me I still play it to this day so let's just jump right into it okay we're just gonna learn one more time and just like I it's not a woman like this I'm just kind of having an off day so this is this one's gonna begin oh okay do you know what that's it that's it for now that's all we're gonna do round we're moving on next we have the folder called coffee because if you know me at all or even if you don't well now you do I really love coffee and it would just be weird if I didn't have apps that like kind of correlated with my addiction first we have coffee shop um this is basically where I can make my own coffee on the app I tend to use this on airplanes in the car where there isn't coffee readily available I will use this app what no I don't want to make tea with today I think we're gonna make a nice blended cappuccino because that's the closest thing to a nice almond milk latte because sadly they don't have iced almond milk lattes in this and it's extremely upsetting select a coffee flavor let's do it we're gonna do the red one I don't know oh yeah baby tilt your milk this is not almond milk oh it's fine it's just an app it's just an app which is an app it's just an app sorry I'm fine select a syrup flavor you know what they all look the same I don't know the difference I'll choose this brown one cuz they're all puffy the Browns okay great now we get to choose a straw I like that one do you know what I don't even like it oh I can decorate it I forgot oh my god it's in abend oh no my god oh my god look at this this actually looks like a nice almond milk latte now so I'm fine till the next kind of folder that we have here is called extremely scary I have Slenderman to start off with so let's just check that out this game is very scary and I only play it every once in a while because it freaks me out and it's not always the best for me to play this but I'm just gonna go out on a limb here and I'm just gonna play the night version you know just trying to find the note chiller whatever it's not even a big deal this game isn't even scary I see an arrow okay just walked into a tree that's dumb yeah yeah buddy so next we have sounds I have to sound apps first we have ham horn let's say you just roasted someone and do is a good roast I just need to take this to the next level yeah this app is great it always comes in handy for me I like to use it all the time the next one I have is the team ten Jake Paul sound board come on this app is amazing I mean seriously oh my god I'm dying good you're modeling in Milan tomorrow this is the most helpful app the last folder that I have on my phone is called I can sing good so the first time I have is

For me, a day in the life consists of juice and surf, basically. I'm just gonna get my juice and then head to the beach. Let's go. Alright, so I heard there's a southern swell today. I'm trying to get juiced I got this almond milk here from the juice place because most juice kind of tastes like dirt water to me It'll do the job just fine, looking forward to going down to the beach waxing up my board You know just really overall having a good sesh I think it's gonna be a good day, a little bit of fog out in the sky But hopefully it'll blow over by the time we get to the dunes. Hopefully. I'm gonna get tubed. Get a few barrels You know today. There's a lot of possibilities. It could really- anything can happen. Got my lucky Shark's tooth. Actually uh, found this one night, when I was surfing. Had it since I was 7. It means a lot to me, really represents perseverance, being on that grind all the time. Let's hit the beach First thing you got to do wax the stick, KC past the wax! I just gotta get in tune with nature before I go out there and shred the gnar It's not something that just comes naturally, you have to prepare yourself. Mentally, physically, emotionally and it's super glassy and the barrels are grinding I just cannot wait to get out on the water today. It's gonna be a great sesh. It's gonna be epic The board's waxed, mind's waxed Gotta go suit up. A little fun hack. Put plastic bags on your feet, wet suit goes on like a glove. I've been practicing for so long getting a wet suit on is not even a struggle. I don't even blink an eye. Are you ready for this? Pop! Easy as pie. Other foot. That's what I'm talking about. It's called surfing life hacks. If you want that comment down below. Ow. Every day that I go out on the water, I have a little sesh That I like to call my cook sesh. I fake fails so that I can try to get on cook slams because like I'm such a good surfer naturally That there's no way I could ever be featured on cook slams. I also have a little ritual I like to do where I just go out there and body surf. Start to feel out the waves feel how things are going today. I mean I can already tell it's looking like it's gonna be a great sesh. But like I got to get connected to Mother Nature first before I can really do my best out there. I got to just tap into the ocean's energy. It's not something that just comes easy. It's not something that just comes simple There's a spiritual level to this that people just don't understand, and I'm just gonna, you know, show you what that is to me It's different for everybody you know, so let's just- let's go Oh, yeah, man! Oh yeah! That's how you know! Man. it's gonna be great. imma go get my board now Alright that was a day-in-the-life. Sesh out there was extremely successful. Rode every single wave I tried to ride it was a great, great, great time got barreled a couple times, but it was all in good fun If you liked this video give it a thumbs up, subscribe to my channel, comment down below anything you want. I love you all so much. See you next time."

So in today's video I'm just gonna be reading all the sweet nice loving comments that I get on a daily basis Just the ones that really touch my heart you know. Some of you guys might be like oh my god, Emma. That's really conceited It's not It kind of is but it's not so let's just get right into it Let's just flippity-flop on into it. Pretty sure like the worst comment that I've ever gotten was like oh my god You're so perfect It's so annoying And like that comment really offended me because it's like calling me annoying and like I'm really offended by that Why is every vlogger in 2017 so boring can't wait for my camera Oh my god, dude I completely agree. Vloggers these days are so unoriginal I am so excited for you to get your camera because I cannot wait To see what the future of vlogging looks like. David Dobrik who? You know no we're all boring. We all suck This kid, his camera is coming in the mail and you best believe all of the vloggers are going to be completely Quaking. Our careers are doomed. Are doomed. The second that his camera comes in the mail, every single vlogger will be shut down Why do you swear? I don't f**king know? *instagram comedy noise x3* Why do people think this is funny? This is just stupid Eh, it's fine. I don't really care. Anyone ever said that you look like Michelle Rosen Michael. I don't even know who that is. Oh my god. It's this guy. From vine! Nice I take pride in the fact that this man looks like me, and if you don't know him from vine You've obviously been living under a rock. Was this a joke or something cuz it was stupid It wasn't a joke. You have a pimple.  Yeah, maybe I do. Do you want to come pop it for me? You were getting on my nerves through the whole thing. Through the whole thing? At least you watched the whole thing *ding* She looks tired. Yeah, well, do you know what maybe it's cuz I am tired. Alright? I'm sick and tired of your bullsh*t. You where trying so hard to be funny, and it's not working for you. Joke's on you You're basically saying that you think I'm funny because you're like you where trying so hard to be funny, basically implying that you deep down Think that I'm funny Not my fault How does someone so annoying have so many followers? See, I-I agree that I'm annoying but like it's not like I have that many followers It's not like I'm some sort of PewDiePie looking a**, like I don't know. Let's have a 10-minute rant over such bullsh*t Better things in life than to talk about a shop grow the f*ck up, b*tch Best thing I could think of was to rant for 10 minutes about a store. If you have any advice for me, please let me know I would love to hear what you have to say. I'd be very glad to listen to your suggestion. Thank you OMG, you are so stupid like are you high or drunk because really normal people only go for cheap supplies and cheap props and cheap costumes, so I think you're dumb, stupid and idiot And how old are you because I don't like you and you don't act your age So yeah. Anybody who ends their sentence with ""so yeah"" is usually a preteen at best So I'm just gonna let you kind of cool down on your own here, and we can talk later alright? OMG this was so not funny. I agree, it wasn't funny. The video sucked. You're that type of sl*t to do that. Even for some YouTube views worthless, no morals Pschh, you really got me, you really got me. This was the video that I pulled down my pants in front of everybody I'm not proud of it. Everyone saw my a** cheeks. I was just doing it for views I was just doing it for the money. How many jump cuts does someone need? Um I don't know if you know anything about jump cuts But I think that they're pretty dope so.. If you don't know what a jump cut is I'll show you. Oh my god, I regret that Is this girl sub botting or what? Honestly I definitely agree with this I'm very confused But I think somebody out there is buying them for me because this is all just a little bit fishy. If you're buying them for me, stop! Okay? I don't want you to do that Instead of spending the money on the subscribers just send the money to me. I'll leave my PayPal link down below Let's see how much it cost to buy subs. How to buy subscribers Seventeen dollars for a hundred subscribers. Wait a minute here, so let's do the math. That would mean that I spent two million dollars on my subs. If you know what that means that means that someone out there right now Spent two million dollars on all of my subs. That is so nice and generous, but please stop You could have sent that two million dollars to me, and I could have had that money in the bank right now But you use that for my subs? Okay This was the worst video I've ever watched. Why the f*** was it in my recommended This girl frickin went in depth. This girl took some time. This girl brought out her Calculator to do this so mad respect, let's read. This girl definitely buys subscribers and views I mean look at her likes out of sixty thousand views only five thousand likes And that's eight percent of the viewers, and like forty people dislike That's like point zero six of all the views guys only Fifteen hundred comments and most of them were positive if that maybe people watched there would be more haters a relatively small channel gaining twenty Thousand subscribers per day without any shoutouts from any big YouTubers. It's pretty shady I mean curse me out all you want and say you're just jealous or then why are you here? But I gotta admit something about this channel seems fishy. I mean I've never gained twenty thousand subscribers in one day I mean in my dreams that sounds great. I'm down. I'm not getting any haters I mean like this video this video doesn't even exist I'm not even getting haters Does the obnoxious zooming ever stop? Guess not. Yeah well do you know what? Obnoxious zooming is really awesomely and effective. It's very effective and cool If you don't like it, then you can just leave because I like it and I think it's really cool She kind of sound bossy the person who making the vid I don't- that's a little bit vague to me like does that mean I'm bossy? Or I don't I'm kind of- Mom if you don't need a grilled cheese in five minutes Using white letters in very bold or very thin fonts on thumbnail lowercase letters entitled to distract from the fact that she's an Alternative basic white b*tch. I'm a little bit- I'm not gonna lie I'm a little bit shook, okay? I don't normally like to use that word But that's the only word I can use it describe my emotion right now I had no clue that like my choices of font could tell you so much about me. Like that is so crazy I'm really glad that you opened up that and showed me that like I need to be careful about what fonts I use because like it's showing people who I am. You are who your font is Do you pop your pimples? Does the sun rise in the morning? Um I don't know if you guys watch Dr. Pimple Popper on Instagram those disgusting videos. Yeah, but those are fun. Okay They kind of make me uncomfortable, but I watched them anyways cuz they're so satisfying I just can't stop. My zits aren't quite as bad as the ones on that account usually so it's not the same but. You're the only one who failed making slime while everyone else actually tried. Congratulations, you can't even make slime I don't- do you know what. I put effort into making that slime, and was it a mess? Yes. It was a mess I don't know how to make slime. I don't, okay? It didn't work for me, and I did try so don't try to take that away from me I thought you were 14, then I saw the video of you driving Sorry, no offense you look young but is that bad thing? Anyways,  how old are you? I'm 16 and do you know what I'm actually very flattered that you think I look 14 because most people think that I look 12 So 14 is a step up and do you know what this isn't even a hate comment, okay? I like this one. Makes me feel good. Your pimple obviously didn't just bleed by itself, you obviously picked it Yeah, I did pick it. Did I ever say I didn't? Everyone thinks you sub bot and hack. Guys what is it with all this sub bots? People think that I sub bot and hack. Like if You're saying everyone thinks that like I need to make sure that I don't want everybody to think that let me call up people Hi, mom um I was just- Oh my god. Um I was just reading my comments people think that I sub bot Do you think that? ""YEah hOney everyoOne thinks that"" Shoot I guess I have to delete my channel. Um am I the only one who thinks that is bad. No offense It's just my opinion. It's not hate, but I have a different makeup taste And um, no offense be lookin Miranda Sings with hot pink lipstick I don't know about you guys, but when people say no offense I tend to get more offended, therefore I am offended. Jump-cuts bcjhbhadkbVzxbnjchsauihcjkSN zjbc I thought your armpits were hairy, but then it was just your hair You're fake. It's not a Tesla, it's a Subaru I know. This comment, it starts out nice not being mean at all my opinion is that you are always Complaining when you talk about pretty easy tasks. What's easy to you is not easy for me. Well. I'm kind of confused You know what? Me too I just really hate you, but then some girl responds well then leave. Do you know what shout out to you, you're a savage. I don't even need to comment on this one because you handled it. Thank you. That was today's video I'm considering deleting my entire channel, but I'm gonna try to persevere and not. If you ever leave me a nice comment Thank you so much because you're the reason why I haven't deleted my channel yet, so to everybody who's nice to me. Okay Thank you. I hope you enjoyed I know I didn't and if you did give it a thumbs up, subscribe to my channel, comment down below Anything you want You know what? Please make it nice because I'm really sensitive And this is very hard for me to deal with. I'll talk to you guys later I love you all very much. Even the people who leave me hate comments.

I LOVE U -emma",2017-08-31T14:31:01Z,64736,2109113,1955,"Oh my God, okay? Hello guys. What is up? Today starting off the vlog in the car. I'm literally- I'm sweating so much right now. It's so hot out. 91 degrees. Today, I'm doing a shoot with my friend Lily, she's a photographer. and then also my friend Reem is coming along, and we're both gonna get our pictures taken I'll insert the clip of my outfits right now these glasses frommmm pacsun, these chokers from Stargaze jewelry, I can leave a link down below if you want or I'll probably forget so we'll see. I'm wearing a bralette from Free People, Top from Urban outfitters, belt is thrifted, Jeans are from Pacsun So yeah, that's what I'm wearing. If you're wondering why my hair looks so weird, I have it in a braid so that it'll be nice and wavy by the time we take pictures (moose noises) So right now. I'm on my way to my friend Reem's house because that's where we're meeting and then we're gonna leave from there It's about an hour and 45 minutes away from where I live. The place that we're shooting at It's definitely a road trip a little bit But I think it's gonna be worth it because it's literally such a beautiful location. I have my coffee as you can see Alright. The gang, We're all together. Guys are you- how are you feeling right now? (Lily: Good) YEAH! Pretzels, gold fish, Graham crackers, this thing, we eating good tonight. I get the pretzels, I hand the pretzels to reem and then reem gives it to lily. You got to keep the driver fueled, you know, for this long road trip. So, we have about an hour and a half of car time I already have to pee so I hope I last. (Screaming) How did you get up there?! What the heck?! The Golden Gate bridge everybody! Why is everything blocking my view? I just want to frickin' see the Golden gate bridge. There it is! Okay another tree. Okay. Listening to Miley Cyrus- or no Hannah Montana, I'm sorry, having a great time, but I have to pee so bad! literally gonna pee my frickin' pants. Oh my God. I drank so much coffee. Oh my God. *screams* I'm actually gonna cry like I'm literally. I'm I'm on the verge of tears. I have no clue where the bathroom is. Not over here. Oh! I found it I found it. Oh my God, I can't even run I feel much better now. She brought an essential. She literally she brought an eyebrow brush. We out here breaking laws I'm really scared Did i break it? No. Drop it low. Okay Lily, last person to get over. You're cold? Well you need to man up. Because you the last one to get over, you have to get over as fast as you can. Go go go! Okay Oh my God! That was epic. Showing reems outfit today. I don't know what is that? Its a bandeau Why are you so mad? I'm not mad. I'm just taking pictures and you're mad because I'm not taking them of you Whoa, this is awesome. You can see her reflection right in my sunglasses Oh my god I have something in my eye Okay Guys stop fighting! It's my turn. She's been taking pictures of you for like five seconds! reme it's my turn! Reme its my turn! Lily, tell her its my turn Guess what? Finally reems turn is over. Its my turn There's so many freaking people and they keep getting in the way of our shot. So we have to go somewhere else now. but you know it's okay because the next location is dope too - why are you upset? reme? Why are you upset? It's a really sad, reem lost her eyebrow brush. She's running. She's running to the car Reem i'm telling you its gonna be okay Its fine, Im fine, we're fine. Are you sure we're good? okay reem are you gonna be okay? Yeah. Are you gonna cry a little bit? uh huh Reem this is so weird But it could look dope in pics, and I think that it will so it's cool. We're at our next location. It's very Windy Why are you mad? I cant see shit. Okay, so we're leaving. We're a little bit stressed out because lily is on empty right now So we're at a random little gas station, and we just have to hope that it works Were vlogging. Vlogging is basically where you like take video of everything you do that day and then you put it on youtube You download it to your computer and then upload it Oh my god you got the jumbo one The road is so windy. I literally think I'm gonna frickin' vomit. I really hope I don't throw up. There's no barf bags in this car. I'm not okay Get back in the car! Did you just find your eyebrow brush? Oh my god We where has it been the whole time? My back pocket So as you saw obviously we were dealing with some extreme fog earlier. I mean like level 10 fog I can't see sh*t but now we drove like an hour and we found this so let's do it Let's see how it goes come on guys Oh my God look at this take this as a lesson if one location doesn't work you just keep going No, take this as a lesson okay, lily she she doesn't like it But you guys can learn from it if one location doesn't work if things seem like they're going bad Don't give up. because see it was so foggy you couldn't even freaking see anything, but now we found this new beautiful place The sun is going down very fast and we have to hike all the way around to out there So we're running we are on the move we are not gonna miss this sunset for anything. Oh my God What even is that wait? Is that poop or a banana? Oh my God wait? I accidentally Fell like I was like running, and then I fell into the bushes, so that's not good just wanted to update you guys I really wish I would have gotten it on but I didn't and I wasn't gonna reenact it so oh yeah My God yes earlier were over there. Reem you have to walk down You got this reem, keep going. It's not my turn yet to wait for reem to be done. I wish it was always me. I wish it was always about me All right, sun is down. I think we're done shooting for the day we get to go home and I have to do Frickin homework because it's Sunday, and I have school tomorrow, so Okay, it's literally 9:55 Chipotle closes in no joke five minutes, and we're gonna see if we can get in right now and get some food cause we hungry five minutes before closing You know guac is extra right? Thank you its about ten o'clock It's ten o'clock. I literally have done any of my homework yet That's due tomorrow, but I mean you know who fucking cares about my homework? Let's just talk about the food How's your guys's quesadillas? good. Wait why couldnt they put guac in it? because it's ""liquidy"" and it would ruin the grill. It's an opinion based question whether or not guacamole is liquidy Do you wanna go inside and get me a clean one? Thats what i thought Bye guys. I'll see you later. See you tomorrow at school. All right peace out yo okay, so I know the lighting is probably absolutely horrible, and I probably look like a freaking crescent moon I'm now going home, and I'm super freakin tired still have to do my homework But i dont freaking care because it was a great day. That's about it for today I'm not really doing anything else. Probably just gonna do homework and then go to bed. So, I hope you enjoyed.

LOVE U GUYS SO MUCH -emma",2017-08-29T13:48:39Z,66228,1474489,4955,"Hey guy it's Emma and today I'm back with a beauty video I felt like my channel really had no quality content before I feel like everything was really honestly sh*tty I really did and I think A lot of people probably agree with me that my channel didn't really have any theme or anything like that So I decided you know what I'm transforming. I'm a beauty guru now Plot twist right! So crazy! To start off my new beauty guru career I wanted to do a back to school makeup tutorial because that's what is popular right now That's what everybody's doing so I decided that that's what I do this look. It's versatile. It's fun. It's unique I've never seen anyone else do something like it honestly There's probably something else in this universe who's done it But I haven't seen it personally you'll definitely get a lot of attention at school a lot of people will be like whoa That girl she is different. Without further ado let's just jump right into it Without without further ado let's get into it. I don't know how to do that the first step and the first thing I'm gonna be doing it gets like in most beauty tutorials and stuff like that you have to start out with like a base of some sort so that you're working on like a fresh Slate get rid of all your imperfections and stuff like that and as you guys know I do have a lot of Imperfections on my face a lot of people like to comment about all my zits and stuff like that cuz I don't cover them well Today guess what you know your eyes, they're gonna be saved today because I'm gonna actually cover my zits for once you're welcome I'm so sorry for all the videos that you had to sit through Where you know you have to stare at my zits for like 12 minutes? So I'm just gonna do what feels right and if it's wrong You know what there's no way, you can be wrong. You just do your best to know for the best so I'm gonna take May believe BB cream and Covergirl Smoothers not getting my beauty blender wet cuz I feel like that's just overrated So I'm just gonna start smearing this around my face also Gonna be covering my eyebrows, too Just cuz I don't know I want a blank slate. I want to start completely fresh I don't want you to be able to eat anything. I want to cover absolutely every single thing on my face I don't know if this is necessarily a popular thing to do to just cover your entire face But I don't really care to be quite honest, so I'm just going with it This is just what feels right to me And if you don't like it, then you can leave I'm also covering my lips because I'll put other stuff over it You know what I mean, oh You know right now guys don't freak out I know that things look a little bit weird right now but Or you just believe in me and just trust that I will make you look you just have to follow my lead And you know what things have to get bad before they get better So we just got to keep going and just keep persevering I think everything's looking pretty covered But you can see my eyebrows too much and I kind of want to cover more of my eyebrows feel like they kind of get In the way, maybe I can use some concealer, so I'm gonna be taking the Master Conceal Maybelline And I'm just gonna try to cover my eyebrows right now and I'll also put some of this underneath my eyes because as you guys know uh-huh I do have really bad under-eye bags because I Don't sleep because sleep is for the weak. I can sleep when I'm dead oh Whoo see look at me. I'm really having trouble covering my eyebrows. They just don't want to go anywhere They want to stay with me. They love me, but I'm sorry eyebrows your time is done Okay, I'm covering you up. I'm looking a little bit better on my face But the eyebrows are really they really need help you can still see that guys. I know what you're thinking right now You're concerned. You're worried You don't like how things are going you don't like what this is all looking like and you think that I'm a phony and you Think that my future and the beauty guru career is over. Well. Do you know what? Think again because I'm just getting started you don't even know what's coming So just please stop hating on me literally I can feel your hatred for this tutorial through the screen But just please give me a freaking chance So right now. I'm just you know rubbing it on with my finger cuz I felt like I feel like I'm getting desperate here Oh, it's not working Okay, we're getting it. We're getting there I'm not giving up yet But I'm getting a little bit discouraged because my eyebrows are not going away like I want them to so next I'm going to be taking this Mara Minerals blemish ready powder And I'm just gonna put this all over my face because I just need a set what's going on here I think that's the right word set I think the whole point of this beginning part is to really create like a clean slate because this makeup look kind of needs a Clean slate I feel like I'm gonna do like a brown smokey. Eye like everyone else I want to do something different now that we're kind of where we are now I think it's time to just get started with the eyes so basically the idea for this tutorial is that I'm basically Gonna be Creating a pencil on my eye if you're confused don't worry I promise it'll make sense the first thing you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to take a yellow eyeshadow I know that that sounds bold. I know that it sounds like a little bit crazy Oh, no No No
No No, no, no No First thing you need to do is to take some concealer and just put it all over your eyelid just to kind of be a little base cuz I don't like A half, I shout out base I'm using this age rewind thing well Oh, maybe I could try to put something this on my eyebrows, okay better. They're hiding they're going away a little bit I mean, I could shave my eyebrows, but I'm just I don't know I don't really want to shave them today sometimes I shave them depending on how I'm feeling that day, okay I think this looks good correct me if I'm wrong a lot of people have like the urban decay primer or something potion or something That's a high roll pretty sure it's really freaking expensive and I'm money like that for freaking makeup I don't spend my money on makeup I spent my my own eye solving the lattes and snacks now that I've covered my eyelid like that It's time to really jump right into the main event you're gonna want to take a yellow color right here. I have the revlon colorstay Exotic Palette on this little thing you're just gonna want to pick up some yellow color start kind of like creating a sort of rectangular shape What is a crucial school supply at school a pencil it's time to pull out your eyeliner. I recommend black liquid liner I'm using this stila stay all day waterproof proof proof Liquid eyeliner basically just Gonna outline the Rectangles that make sense so as you can see here we have this rectangle, and then we have this little square right here Which will be the eraser, we'll color that in later And then lastly we have to draw a little tip which is the end of the pencil okay? This isn't going as well as I planned you just have to oh Okay, my I didn't let my eyeliner dry. So that's a problem. We're gonna need to fix that but for now I'm gonna let that dry it has this rough outline of a pencil But it's a little bit rough around the edges right well Don't worry take a thin brush And then take any sort of skin color face product just kind of clean up around the edges You know what I mean, I'm assuming at home you guys will probably end up making similar if not more extreme mistakes Don't be hard on yourself. There's always ways to fix it. Just remember. It's supposed to be fun So I'm gonna take this again And I'm just gonna go back over the lines and try to make them cleaner this time wish me luck. Oh, yes much better Oh yes, so as you can see my eyeballs give this rough outline of a pencil and yes That's great and all and I could even stop here if I wanted to but he'll to the no I am not stopping here this Is not the final product the next thing that you're Gonna want to add in An eraser because as you can see we have the eraser in the inner corners of her eyeballs I don't even know what I want to use for the eraser. You know what I'm using this okay? case closed nyx Mega Shine lip gloss Okay, okay. Yes. Yes yes, yes Yes
This is good this next is a very crucial step this is Gonna add some texture to your eyeball pencil take your Eyeliner again draw some lines across it cuz like you know pencils are like kind of rigid I don't know if you can tell here I have the lines on my pencil eyeballs So the last main aspect of the eyes that we need to do is basically add a little bit of glitter I don't know about you guys But I think glitter is Crucial for any makeup tutorial so I just bought these two little glitter things from target there were 99 cents each um yes hanging on A budget am I right ladies think about this right now think about the lead on a pencil think about it Please pencil it has a little shimmer to it So take some of the glitter put it onto the tip of the pencil the glitter makes it stand out Before it was just a pencil now. It's a real pencil now. You're just something I want to blend it out with your finger obviously don't smudge anything because you just worked hard on this okay? So now that your eyeballs look like pencils. I know you're thinking emma that look it's a little bit too bold for me There's no way I could ever wear that to the first day of school But don't try to tell me that this isn't kind of impressive. It's a statement It says I'm excited to come back to school, and I'm about to kill it this year. We're almost done. We're gonna take even more Concealer I know it's crazy put this on our lips like it's lip gloss Okay, so now that your lips are basically invisible It's time to really turn this into our as you can see I'm kind of on the whole idea of like school supplies, right? So we got pencils what else do you need for school an eraser? So I'm gonna be turning my mouth and do a moving eraser so you're gonna dig it and you're just gonna want to draw out kind of a rectangle around your mouth try to make it as Rectangular as possible just because the more rectangular it is the more it looks like a real eraser We're trying to make this look real okay. We're not trying to just mess around here. This is the first day of school We're talking about first impressions. You know this is what your teachers are Gonna Think about you for the rest of the year you want them to have a good impression of you you're not gonna want things to look fake show up to art class looking like this and your teacher is Gonna give you an a Without you even having to do an assignment because this is art. Okay. Don't even try to denominator So fill it in don't be afraid to pack it on because the school day is very long and this is not all day Nobody likes one your makeup friggin crunches off by the end of the day that does not look good just for some definition I'm thinking we should maybe outline the racer lips with like some black We're actually almost done I know it's crazy And it's kind of sad we have to do our eyebrows because I feel like that's the only thing I'm missing here We're gonna turn our eyebrows into rulers draw one around each eyebrow, and then just kind of do the little dash marks You know on a ruler hopefully I'm not going too fast honestly I'm sad that I came up with this after my first day at school. My first day school already happened If you're at home, and you're like, you know I'm not really the biggest fan of An Eyebrow Ruler you can turn your lips into a ruler you could turn your eyebrows into erasers It's up to you the whole idea here is just to use school supplies as an inspiration and just go with it I'm gonna be adding some silver glitter just to kind of spice things up a little bit I feel like it's a little bit boring. I Know it's crazy. We've been on this journey together back to school makeup journey, and it's coming to an end. This is the completed tutorial So that was it for this makeup tutorial today, obviously I'm not a beauty guru and I never could be of you to do if you're a beauty guru out there I've just said beauty guru way too many times if you are good at makeup out there, I Respect the hell out of you because this is hard anyways that was today's video I hope you enjoyed it And I hope that you wear this to your first day of school because come on if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up Subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want I appreciate every single last one of you I'll see you guys next time peace out"

I LOVE U GUYS SO MUCH IM CRYIN NO JOKE :,)",2017-08-24T14:16:17Z,35962,763591,2471,"Hey guys, it's Emma and today. I'm back with another video and in today's video I'm gonna be doing something very fun and exciting because if you saw my vlog that I posted the other day my first day of School vlog you would have seen that I went to target and I picked up some school supplies But I decided not show them to you guys because I assume that you guys didn't care well turns out you guys actually do kind Of care, or at least like two of you cared, so I decided you know what fine If this is what you guys want from me. I will do it I got some school supplies from the dollar store and from Target I've been going to school for 11 years, so it's about time Then I start getting school supplies that really match me. You know what I mean something I really can use I feel like half the time you know you buy all this stuff and you don't even use it this stuff useful cool and Very perfect the first store i went to was the dollar store. I really thrive at the dollar store I don't know just love it there. I always find good stuff. So let's just get right into it So the first thing I got these mini snorkel glasses Wow, I don't know about you, but I'm ready to dive into the school year. Who's with me? *Booing* I'm sorry, so the next thing I got their little Certificates so as you can see it says you're a star on it. You know I used to get these back in Elementary school I'm in high school now, and we don't really get those anymore But when I was younger, that was the only thing that motivated me through school So now I basically just make myself little awards. I just wrote myself up a little certificate here the ability to give myself Rewards for doing schoolwork being a savage you know stuff like that. It'll keep me motivated It'll keep me going if I'm having a hard test or something like that. I'll just like get myself an award I don't know okay. It's my own mental game. I also picked up these minion pens pencils I don't know if you guys ever had these when you are in elementary school slash middle school slash high school these kinds of pencils Are the most convenient and savage when you run out of lead here you have to take off the top watch this Yeah, right, pretty dope and just what do you think you can get any better these have minions on it! MINIONS! See, I don't know if you guys still have recess. I don't personally we have something called like brunch I don't even know what we call it Ok but like you know at recess study in a snap you can't just be starving yourself all day So I picked up these toast them pop them pop toast them pop ups i think this is like the more expensive brand of like Pop-Tarts. pop-tarts are just like trashy these are like classy pop-tarts I haven't tried these before so I'm just gonna whip it out and just try one and see how it is as you can see There's some black stuff on it. I don't know what that's from wow lots of Jelly on the inside Moving on. kind of following along with the whole self-rewarding theme. I got these 180 motivational stickers for example We got this one. It says so smart this one says looking good this one says school rules school matters wow I'm actually thinking that what I'm gonna do is before i turn into a homework assignment I'm just gonna stick one of these stickers on the homework And then it'll play like this weird mind game with the teacher and they'll be like wow they already have a sticker on their homework This homework assignment must be really well done and they won't even have to grade it because the sticker tells all They already know that I just killed that assignment, and they don't even know don't worry about it. So moving on okay I don't know about you guys, but I do wear glasses these are my old ones yay So you know I've these my eyes are strained. I don't know what happened, okay? I decided to get these new glasses from the dollar store because I don't know these ones were just kind of old and ugly so I decided to get these as you can see they rest nicely on the lower part of your nose I look like a mixture of a grandpa and like the worst teacher you've ever had in your life. That's me right now I think they're gonna catch the attention of all of my classmates How am I supposed to see the front of the board all the way from the back of the class? Without these bad boys. I don't know. I got these Disney princess double-edged sorted, double-edged, Double sided crayons there's a lot you could say about this Here's the thing about a double-edge crayon that you don't understand for this one for example You got rapunzel on it But that's not the part that anyone cares about and one you have red and on one side you have brown so let's say You're writing yourself a certificate for the day because you really slay during class you are really killing it you know you're writing on And then you're like, you know what I'm bored of this color. I'm bored of it. All you gotta do watch This are you ready, okay? Bow other color. I know you're gonna say you know emma You might not get it, but the convenience and the ease of just going like this BOW! You know I don't know whatever last thing I got from the dollar store before we move on to Target I'm kind of branching out with this item I got this classic cars 12-month calendar as you can see we got all these cars I don't really know much about cars, but what I'm thinking is. see a lot of people You know they have many little planners where you write down your homework what you got to do that day or whatever Yeah, that's fine, but planners are always so small I don't understand what the why you can barely write down anything and then so correct me if I'm wrong but my whole idea is Instead of using a planner. I'm just gonna carry around a calendar with me. Oh my God I just remember it on the 20th of April. I have a very important confidential event important Confidential event now though this won't fit in my backpack because it is quite large. I can just roll it up Shove it in my pants, and I'll have it with me all of the time I don't know about you, but I'm changing the game here This is so much more creative and innovative than any sort of planner that you can get from Target I DON'T FREAKIN' CARE That is the way to go moving on to Target so the first thing I got was from the dollar section cuz you know I'm ballin on a budget so the first thing. I got was six pencils they're not mechanical pencils, but Whatever. I don't even own a pencil sharpener, so I don't know what I'm gonna do but it says best friends forever on it So my whole idea was that I'm gonna call up some of my friends right now I'll ask them if they want one And then we can like all have the best friend pencils gang gang like squad like Rollin up, best friends forever pencils You know what? I mean, it'll be cool. So I'm just gonna call it my friends real quick and see if they're interested Yo, what's good? So I just went to target and I got these dope pencils. That say best friends forever on it Do you want one because like we could all have you know we could all have one and then it'll be super cool and like Everybody jealous and stuff. hell no. what the f**k I would never want to share something like that with you you're so annoying why do you keep calling me? So you know I don't even like that girl so him to call another Yo, so I have this really cool idea So I picked up these pencils from Target on the dollar section cuz you know that's where I thrive I got these really cool pencils They say best friends forever on it and because we're best friends forever do ya want one we could both be using it in class together everybody would think we're complete savages you down What the f**k emma? Call me one more time, and I'm literally blocking your number. You're so f**king annoying. I hate you Hey, you know what more for me, so the next three things I got from Target We're all kind of along the same lines now that I'm in high school. It's expected that. I just get those plain boring a** folders and like stuff that all look the freakin same just like black, white, Green, blue, Navy, blue, red Boring guess what?! it's a different game this year, okay? I want to take it up a notch first thing I got was this folder. It says let's taco 'bout it (pun itended) um my plan with this is like. Let's say I'm having trouble and it's I'ma and I'm like you know what I gotta go talk to the teacher I'm a little bit confused you say no words you walk up to the teacher, and you're just like and she's like of course of course student let's taco 'bout it (pun again). She's like wow emma you know you are so punny and cool I'm just gonna do the assignment for you if you show up to the teacher and you start shoving puns down her throat She won't know what to do with you She'll just have to like surrender to your savage like she won't know what to do. So anyways, I got this Notebook and it says don't flip out on it I actually picked this up because I wanted to talk about it with you guys it says on it Don't flip out, but something about that kind of offends me because I don't know about you guys But like when I get assigned a lot of homework. I'm not gonna Lie flip out a little bit I do the half the time when I'm doing my homework And I don't Understand what's going on because I was too busy doing other things during class it shall not be named if my teacher is watching this I'm taking notes, okay? You know this is don't flip out like yeah, I know I'm flipping out right now. Don't tell me what to do F**k, F**k! Okay, this next thing honestly. I'm mostly excited about this like everything else in this haul kind of sucks This is the best thing by a landslide because it's going to be the most useful I don't know about you guys But I'm kind of a savage in class I tend to roast my teachers on accident it honestly just happens so consciously I don't realize they do it, but like it's so easy to roast them, so let's say you know I'm in class the teacher says something, and I'm just like haha Freakin roast them all right I roast them the living f**k out of them and they just don't know what to do They're just standing there. They're speechless the entire class is laughing the teacher got roasted, okay? Just one the whole class and everybody thinks and it couldn't get any better. I hold up this bad boy game over Motherf**ker game over Literally this notebook could help me be a living f**king meme, okay? I'm living for it, and I can't wait to use that to my benefit Ok so the next thing I got I'm genuinely excited about so if you can't tell you know me and minions We will love-hate relationship. If you've been watching my videos for a while I hate them but at the same time I'm addicted to them. I can't get enough I've never even watched the movie all the way through because it's just so annoying, but I got this Big a** paper clip, Lo and behold it has fuckin minions at the top I don't know exactly what I'm gonna use this for it just seems handy to me I just there's no way that this won't come in handy at some point the last thing I got I saw this and I was Like you know what I love puns.

Keys right here Money in the bank you're wondering how I got this you know being in the middle class citizen I am How I could get a nice car like this I got it from Craigslist. Haters will say  it's fucking fake look at the keys. It doesn't lie Let's get into it. So starting at the front of the car. We got the grill. We got the logo right here We got the custom plate Harambe California plate. It's where I'm from pretty self-explanatory we got lights We got the hood of the car don't know how to open the hood, but you know what? If I need it fixed That's what the car shop is for this girl don't got to do shit Moving on as you can see you know just got my car washed, but a bird already shit on it mother nature you do you I'm just living in your world you know what I mean Handles to open the door as you can see here You know we got four handles four doors cause a two-door car The fuck is that? How you supposed to roll with your team if you only got two doors? Next how do you get this bad boy around if you don't use something right? As you guys know the tesla model s, it is An electric car. As you can see you open up the gas nozzle and you just take out this year cord Either charge your phone with it or plug it into one of those tesla chargers And you know what this bad boy can take you anywhere. I don't really know what this thing is for It's kind of just there. I don't know I've never used it. I think it's like an electricity holder I don't know nice. We got the back of my whip as you can see we got the tesla right here we got the model s Right here, we got the proof no emissions no Emissions. I don't even need to talk about it. You guys already know what's up I know. I already talked about it like four times before but it's barely real to me I want to make sure it's real to you. We got the tesla logo right here you know Finally being in the top 1% it just feels so good to fit in Continuing on oh we got these wheels I got four of them. You know because that's kind of how a car works I don't know why it got the Subaru logo on it I really can't figure out how the subaru logo got onto my tesla, but I spent so much money on it I'm not going to question it craigslist is a very reliable source. That's basically the outside of the car. Let's see what's inside alright So here we got the little thing right here where we can hold you know anything we want Pepsi, Dr. pepper, Sprite, Kombucha, Red Bull, Monster, Rockstar, Sunny D, chocolate milk Titty milk. Suit yourself lock the doors just in here the creepers coming by open all the windows. Being the driver of this car You've got control of every window in this car We got the wheel here the tesla logo on the wheel, so I'm trying to like snapchat You know all the new snapchats go up here Take a picture like this snap a pic everybody about to be jealous in my life, they see that snapchat They're like Emma's life is the life. We can control the phone here. They know me They know I'm always on the phone with my managers with my agents speak commands all that shit moving on You know what a blinker is yeah, I know what it is but I don't ever use one because blinkers are just annoying next we got the windshield AHHH How do I? I don't know how to stop it. Okay Anyways, it gives you the r per minute mine goes up to 8 which is very very fast. I think. We got the speed limit okay mine goes from 0 to 420 usually I don't go past 20 miles per hour But if we really boolin we'll go up to 420 you know what I mean it tells me about my gas tank Tells me how full it is. How empty it is I'm kind of like glass half-full kind of gal So my tank always full. So it gets a little bit steamy in my car because like I'm in it You know what I mean, AC system up in here. Top of the level It's unreal how great it is. The radio where I listen to all of my bops all those slaps New and fresh off the press. Got my hazard lights. I like to use these whenever I'm in traffic. Just for fun Just kind of freak people out Why is there hazard lights on you know what? I don't know what I'm using it for we got the glove compartment Department open up Department, Lumbar man as you see I like to keep these bad boys in the car, too. These are designer um So you got a lint roller because y'all know if you're wearing black? You know what happens. I don't know if y'all can see. We got some pens I got some salt We got some hair ties in here. We got a little kit. Shout-out to my mom she made this for me Love you mom, you know hand sanitizer. Whatever no one cares. also We got sour patch gum This shit tastes like shit. You chew it And then it's flavorless fuck this I'll have a sock so welcome to the back seat as you can see very spacious We have this blanket. I got it for free. I spent $20 at American Eagle. American Eagle, if you're watching this, please sponsor me I'm very poor. I mean, I'm rich next we got Kleenex I'm not gonna lie to y'all right now When I'm in the car. I like to listen to some sad tunes and sometimes One thing leads to another and I'm bawling in the car So then next I got these beats by Dre s-- we out here the beats I like to edit with these I like to trap to these whatever I'm feeling But yeah, these are beats by dre, beats by dre if you want to sponsor me. As I said before I'm really poor I mean really rich I don't need your sponsorship, but I'd like it though Next we got this this is where I hold my chocolate milk This is where I hold my Arizona iced tea Kombucha my coconut water But you know as we've been through before I like a buttload of beverages all of them can fit in here Except sadly if you go to 7-eleven and you get a big gulp. It doesn't fit in here what the hell am I supposed to do if I go to 7-eleven and I get 300 ounces of Pepsi and I can't even fit it nowhere. Moving on I got just spare change hanging around. I don't know I'm gonna cut that part out I don't want to show my money in this video I don't want to make nobody jealous because you know if you dislike this video. Who are you you know don't be jealous of me I'm your inspiration. You know what I mean, if you don't have one of these in your car I would very much recommend it is a trash can so yeah, so as you ""Yeah what's going on party people. It's Jake-JAke-JAKE Paul."" Oh I don't know what that's doing in there. We got this Alright, so I don't know if y'all know or if y'all travel a lot, but I do you know when you're in the plane There's like one of these little things with the magazines in it and stuff like that. Well for me when I'm really missing Traveling when I'm at home a lot you know sometimes I'll just stick a few magazines in here sit back here like this and just read the magazines and act like I'm on a private Jet my private jet is in the shop right now. They said it'll be done in about three years don't worry about it It's none of your business anyway, so we got some real Cherrywood right here straight out from Japan and Indonesia I went there and hand-picked the wood even though I ordered it on Craigslist. They told me I had options You know it really makes it personalized to me. It makes it more special to me, and I just I really love it Let's open up the trunk Alright, so next we got my trunk. We got this box in here. We got a blanket We got a first aid kit as you can see it's pretty empty. This is a new car. So there's nothing in my trunk This is an emergency lever. What that's for is that if somebody's locked in the trunk they can pull on that And it'll open the trunk, but I actually disabled that for reasons that are my own business I Also like to take naps in there sometimes I'll store illegal animals in there tigers rattlesnakes Chimpanzees the last part of the outside of this car This is actually some chimpanzee poop when I ordered my chimpanzee from Zanzibar. It got a little Rowdy And it shit all over my car. Chimpy if you watching this it's okay I forgive you but next time you're going in the kennel. Don't forget it. What's a car with out the jams *various songs play* So I don't know if you know anything about Teslas But if you do you know that they are automatic as you can see it's driving itself I don't have to move the wheel it moves itself But I actually prefer to use the wheel because I like being controlling. See look ma no freaking hands. You can hear that beep. It's low on energy. We got to go fill her up We rollin up to the electric charger let's go, so let's just plug it in   Oh, You know see I pulled up to the wrong side, so I think I'm just going to charge it when I get home But at least you guys get to see where I get to charge my car cause like you know now You don't need to see me charge it that's boring. I got enough electricity to get home I'm thinking about a G Wagon next you know I gotta save those pennies I'm saving up for a new cartridge for my printer anyways. I'll see you later. Hope you liked hanging out with me I'll see you next time PEACE Oh wait-hahaha"

THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR 17K IM SO THANKFUL AND BLESSED I LOVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF U",2017-08-20T14:57:57Z,230907,6844039,Not available,"This is 100% the saddest day of the entire year for me I am so sad right now summer 2017 was very good to me during summer 2017 I started this YouTube channel during summer 2017. I went on some trips during summer 2017 I over all just had a great last time and Now I have to go back to the one place that sucks out all of the happiness out of my life And that is school nothing about this situation excites me nothing about that makes me want to smile every But on the bright side my first day of school outfit is pretty poppin. I'm not going to lie I'll insert the clip right now because do we have the nice on quarter zip looking thing We have here nice very Trendy pleated skirt because you know we did skirts are so in this season vans socks Super Trendy and cute in some white vans. I did pick this out on my own no I did not have a stylist to pick it up for me, okay Well, you can't tell I go to private school. So I wear the same uniform every single day I can't even be excited about like my first day school outfit just when you thought that like going back to school couldn't get any Worse like for me, but I can't even like pick out my freakin back-to-school outfit, but it's okay So you know I need to be more positive about the situation everyone goes to school well not everyone But most people go to school, okay? This is cool. Casually. There's just a truck just sitting happily being in my way. How am I going to get around it? I don't know. I'm just gonna have to drive in the opposite side of the road and just try to yep, okay This is extremely illegal, okay. It's not trying to be a negative nelly here I promise the tone of this vlog will change soon I just need to get out my feelings my emotion just when he thought that this morning couldn't get any worse I was like hey you know what I'm going to reward myself for Persevering and being a good student and just showing up to school despite the fact that I really don't want to go you know I Was going to reward myself by going to a cafe and getting a coffee this morning But low and behold with my luck I google the hours for both of the cafes near where I live and One of them opens at 9 and the other one opens at 8 a.m.. And it's 7:45 right now I have to be at school at 8:30 so I don't have I'm really wait for one of them to open and the other thing that makes this whole thing even more annoying is the fact that I literally left 45 minutes before school starts, and I live like five minutes away from my school But I did that because I expected to be able to go get coffee So that's not The best literally going to be at school thirty minutes early this morning also in case you guys were wondering I know This is really relevant But I did in fact finish all of my summer reading last night literally last night the day before school started It was very stressful, and then I got tired and I fell asleep doing that the school year has even started yet My habits are already like extremely bad I save all of my english summer reading for the last day and then not only that but I Couldn't even finish it the night before like because I was too busy I was like on YouTube, and I was like doing fun stuff and like on Twitter and stuff like that I was doing fun stuff I didn't I don't know I didn't want to work on the assignment And then next thing I know it's 11 o'clock, and I hadn't done it yet. So I was like you know learn I'll just like retool sparknotes. It's like no big deal. We're doing it till like midnight Got tired couldn't do anything anymore stopped working on the assignment woke up this morning at 6:00 a.m. Finished the assignment and like that's what I do like during me here, or what I'm like really Struggling like what I'm really having a hard time. That's when I'll resort to like it extreme measure like that It's already come to that point and it's still summer I haven't even gone to school yet, and I'm already like fucking up in every aspect, but you know what that's okay There's the garbage truck literally just when I thought this day couldn't get more inconvenient the garbage truck is in the way, so I can't fit through that little hole right there so I'm just gonna have to wait that's okay because I have time to spare because I thought I was going to be getting a Coffee this morning, but nope no, I'm not okay. I'm sorry I promise I'm not this passive-aggressive like if this is the first video you've ever seen to me like I'm not normally like this It's just school brings out the worst in me, and you are seeing it here, so I'm literally almost at school now This is also a nice first day of junior year junior year It's supposedly the worst year of high school and for me freshman and sophomore year We're also pretty bad so I don't know we're off to a bad start But you know what I need to turn this day around I can't be all negative like this all the time. I try to vlog at school I'm probably going to get my phone taken away But really I don't even care because youtube is life and youtube is better than school, so I prioritize this over school Okay I'm actually think I'm gonna run into Safeway right now and see if they have like a pre Made a coffee or something like that because like I kind of need a little Something you know and there's a Safeway right by my school. Don't kidnap me please I'm giving you information and all they brought in my sweatshirt or whatever. I don't really care I don't live that close to my school. So you can't fucking kidnap me early That's what I tell myself to me once. I'll feel better I want to go into Safeway right now, and I'll see you in a sec Yay If you didn't think that I was extra before like now you're really going to think so just listen to what I just did so basically have you know I went into Safeway to try to get like a premade coffee that was already with almond milk and stuff like that But obviously as you could probably assume that didn't really happen, so I bought this chameleon cold brew Espresso coffee and this super aesthetic looking vanilla bean almond milk and then I was like I don't have anything to put these in and they don't have ice So I bought this frigging Starbucks cup asked for ice from the Starbucks lady cuz you know how they have like Starbucks in Safeway So now I'm gonna like make my own almond milk latte right now first. I'm gonna try. This. This is just a cold brew It's not that good on its own. Okay, okay, okay? Next. We're going to try the almond milk. Oh my God This is really good. Oh It's a good combo. You know what I don't have any regrets I wanted a coffee, and I made it happen so the lady when I asked her I was like yeah Can I just have some ice she was like why would you ever want that like she was like expecting me to be like can? I have a grande like Nonfat like extra whip but like no whip frappuccino all I asked for was ice and she was like ok?    Update, I'm at school pull up to school and she's right there, and I'm like oh, it's a good day It is the first official moment of me walking into this horrible place By vibe all right? How's everyone feeling not good. I'm joke I'm already done. Are you feeling okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? Yeah, she's so crap. I'm very unhappy two L's later your graph paper Yes, please well, I can't borrow it cuz we can't give it back True, but like but it won't it will be used though Yes, please that'd be awesome. Thank you so much page number one cool. Thank you. All right Sweet no, I have a bowl of miss there, please help yourself One particular to launder money. I wish it once a week About to do a math assignment. I'm very excited about it. I'm not excited to actually fall wait What is this is this shoot chapter 1. I don't know what I'm doing So first day officially over we got to my friends here. We got a lisa and we got grace guys hello today We had a rally okay, rowley excited y'all know and that was really fun get out of your life Oh one more thing rate today out of 10 I'll give it a 6 All right You either give it a 6 - you know what I'm gonna give it a 7 because I'm nice First day of junior year was one for the Frickin books you know the first day school is basically where the teachers just give you class syllabus and then the Only homework is just have your parents sign it. I don't know about you guys I'm a savage, and I just like sign it myself, but don't worry my parents are okay with that They're a dad sign it I trust that you read it so I'm going to try to make the rest of today's vlog Relatively interesting because I mean it's a school day and for me school days are like the most bland days of my life It's like go to school. Go home. Maybe go to the gym If I'm feeling extremely funky do homework of course until like 2:00 a.m. Every single night of my entire life and then go to bed, so that's basically my life but I'm gonna try to keep things funky fresh for all you guys because Yay It's all more time Literally all of my homeworks for like every single class is to read Syllabus since silla I don't know how to take plural syllabus is like multiple, Syllabus if I Don't know how to say that but I definitely signed a bunch of these it's easier than like normal homework So I'm not going to complain for the past few hours I basically did homework aka signed syllabus is still don't know how to say the plural of that word But it's okay now. I need to go to Target because I Need to get school supplies when I was younger I would buy school supplies before school started, but now that I'm in high school um that's not how it works anymore I Go shopping after the teachers give us like all the lists of stuff that we need because I never know like what a teacher is Going to want me to have and it's always so random It's like one teacher will want a one-inch binder and another teacher wants like a 2.5 inch binder And it's just so confusing and you can never predict what they want so go to Target now. Get some school supplies Hopefully, it's not too busy  Target vlog I Just finished a target. I would give you guys an in-depth school supply haul But honestly, I really don't feel like anybody hears about it. You don't care I don't care that was my little Target adventure. It was great. Not really but you know what we tried, okay? We tried that was it for today's long if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up subscribe to our channel comment down below anything you want I love you all so much and Appreciate every single last one of you more than you even understand and I can't wait to see you next time"
22eIG1wpe_c,EMMA'S LEGENDARY COFFEE RECIPE,I FINALLY SHOW YOU GUYS MY LEGENDARY COFFEE RECIPE!!!! i hope you all make it and love it as much as i do… it’s honestly flawless haha (im in love if you cant tell).,2017-08-18T14:36:15Z,261453,6811952,6896,"Hey guys, it's Emma and today I'm going to be filming my most requested video in the entire universe. Today, I'm going to be showing you guys my iconic, life-changing, state of the art, one and only, unique coffee recipe. It's very specific. It's the same every single time. Obviously if I go out to a cafe or something like that, I get an iced almond milk latte, but when I'm at home, this is what i do. Try it out at home, don't try it out at home, up to you.  Okay, so the first step is to put your hair up because this entire process is extremely intense and rigorous, so you can't have your hair be getting in the way, you know? Next, you to get out all the stuff that you need for this process. Number one: a french press. Number two: coffee beans. Number three: one of these things. Oh, and you also need to have like hot water, so I have one of these things - handy little things - which basically boils water for you. If you don't have one of these I would actually really recommend. Very handy. AA AA So, I don't know, however you want to boil your water, boil your water. I'm using this thing, and all you have to do is just go like this, and it's on. So, I'm gonna shove this over here while I wait. Now. Now that the water is starting to boil, I have a very limited amount of time to do the next step, but I just have to take a deep breath and do it. So, what you do is you take this thing, which is basically like a coffee bean grinder. You plug it in and try not to get electrocuted, and if you do - you know what? It's fine. You quickly take your beans. Today I'm using the counter culture coffee in the flavor big trouble. This one has a caramel nutty round flavor I don't really know how something can taste round, but it does so that's good No, no none of these can be wasted Anyway, and you pulse it. Okay, probably ready. So then you take this, and you just pour all the grounds inside, like so. Basically you're done with that. So now you wait for your water to be done boiling. It's starting to really rev up here AAAAA batten down the hatches the water is ready take the boiling water and pour it like That much then take a spatula and mix it Next you wait for 30 seconds. I don't know why but you do THEN- you take this And you kind of like shove it on the top- wait you set a timer for- 4 minutes, and then you wait Yes!!! Which is like the funnest part? So now that you have waited patiently and it's probably been hard because you know you want it so bad you think that oh? It's time. It's finally time, but sadly you'd be wrong. It's not coffee time yet Sorry, basically if you take the freshly brewed coffee, and you pour it into Mason jars, okay? Then get rid of this cause you don't need it- you seal the tops and then these bad boys have to go in the fridge for like an hour because personally I don't like hot coffee because I think it's Basically the like time frame you can actually drink it. It's so limited. It's like in the beginning It's too hot and you're just waiting for it to cool down then for like 20 seconds It's at like the perfect temperature where it doesn't burn your mouth But it's not too cold so you try to like drink it all at that time and then next thing you know it's too cold The drink and it tastes like shit- for me if you have an ice drink you can take your time You can drink it all at once. It's up to you personally I drink iced drinks all year round- whether it's two degrees outside or 200 I will drink an ice drink every time I will never drink a hot drink that is me. I don't know about you So these have to go in the fridge now because like if you pour all this hot coffee Over ice it just melts all the ice, it's all watery and you don't want that so now We have to wait for like an hour for this to cool down, so this is going to take awhile But it's worth it trust me. I guess it's pretty worth it So hopefully by this time your coffee is at least room temperature it's not really cold take a Mason jar because Any other kind of cup would just be embarrassing and you take a reusable straw because I'm trying to preserve the Earth here then AAAAAAA Get some ice Ow- shake it up, because some of the grounds may itself to the bottom and you don't want that, so To about there mix it up so that the ice, doesn't you know Almond milk the kind that I use is the new barn vanilla almond milk it is so good I literally can't even express to you how good this is all other almond milk can suck it pour this into about here that Is so beautiful take your nut pot original unsweetened it has to be the original flavor. This is a key ingredient I love these so much, but me my mom have to order them off Amazon because they don't sell them in store anymore And they're like really hard to find it's very complicated, but it's worth it Fill that up to the very top slowly mix and watch it get all Swirly and stuff now that your coffee looks like a literal goddess like look how frickin beautiful she is then you just take a sip I'm at a loss- this coffee is me in a drink me and her get along we get along so well No one can break our bond. She knows me more than anyone else. She is the epitome of a BFF I love everything about her. She is truly a blessing to this earth You enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up subscribe my channel comment down below anything you want let me know if you make it And tell me what you think if you hate it. I'm sorry, but if you love it, you're welcome I love you guys so much appreciate every single one of you, and I will see you next time"

Hey guys, it's Emma, and today, I'm going to be multitasking. By multitasking, I mean folding my laundry, drinking some coffee, and answering Q&A questions that you guys DM'ed me on Instagram. You know what? I had a lot of laundry that I needed to fold, and I also had a lot of questions that I needed to answer and I thought, ""Well, why not kill two birds with one stone and just do it at the same time?"" Okay, so let's just jump right in- no, I'm not going to say that. If you DM'ed me a question, thank you so much I appreciate every single question that I received if I didn't get to it today, I still love you. And I hope you still love me. It is not personal. Okay! OKAAAYY First question. If you can be in one TV show, what would it be and why? I would probably say The Office because I love the office and it is definitely my favorite show. I wouldn't want to, like, replace one of the already existing characters because the characters in The Office are all so good. Literally every single character is just flawless in all ways. I would want to just, like, be a new character in it, you know? I want to be just like an intern or something and I would want to be Kevin's girlfriend because Kevin is just a big hunk of love and he deserves a loving relationship on the show because there's so many other relationships. All these couples but Kevin never has any love. So, I'd love to be Kevin's girlfriend. Moving on.. What is the average size of your poop, or how many times do you poop a day? Moving on. Next question. What do you want to do when Youtube dies?
 When YouTube dies, I want to die. If somehow you got into a fight, what kind of ninja moves would you use to take down your opponent? Ow, ow. Oh my god. Oh! If you had to go back and be a younger age, what would it be? I would like to go back and be a newborn baby because honestly, I don't have any, like, I don't remember what it's like to be a newborn baby. And, I feel like that's just so awesome. You don't even know what's going on You don't even care you give zero f**ks. All you care about is just, like, finding your mom's nipple. What a simple life. You know what I mean? Like, being a teenager, there's so many more things to be stressed out about. But like, being a newborn baby, god, like, that was the life! If you could swim in a pool of coffee, would you? Then, would you drink it? *stirs and sips coffee* When I get older and you know, have my own home, and I have a family and stuff like that. And if I'm fortunate enough to have a pool at my house, I would only fill it with coffee. Chlorinated water? That's so 2017. Then the next question was, ""Would you drink it?"" In my world, no coffee goes to waste. Therefore, of course. Is that gross? No! If someone offered you to eat a chicken nugget for one million dollars, would you eat it even though you're vegetarian/vegan? Vegetarian, vegan, I don't give a f**k. If somebody was about to give me one million dollars to eat one chicken nugget.. I'd f***ing swallow that s**t whole! What's the most coffee you've had in a day? Honestly, this question is hard for me to answer because honestly, every day is just a whole new journey with me and coffee, you know? But I would say the most I've ever had in one day would probably be five coffees Yes. The amount of caffeine that I consumed that day probably caused me to have at least 10 panic attacks. Literally if I drink two coffees, I'll kind of start to get a little bit jittery and freaked out. But, like, five? That wouldn't end well for me. What's the most awkward thing that happens to you at school? I don't know about your guys' school. But at my school, they let us use our computers for like school work and stuff like that during class. You know, they like to be really technology savvy. As if. But, whatever. Technically, you were allowed to be on our computers during class as long as we're working on the assignments that we're supposed to be working on. But for me sometimes, I'm just really not feeling it, you know The teacher is talking about the square root of 69, and I'm like: You know what teacher? I'm done. I'm done. I'm over it. I don't care anymore. I've already been here for five and a half hours and, I still have to be here for another two and a half. And the last thing that I want to do is listen to you talk about the square root of 69. That's just not- I don't care. Then, I'll go on my computer, and you know what? I'll go on Pinterest., I'll go on Instagram, I'll go on Twitter. Sometimes, I little bit carried away. I forget that I'm at school I'm so consumed by what's on my computer that I kind of forget that, you know, the teacher is lecturing. And the next thing I know,  the teacher notices that I'm not paying attention. And the teacher comes over to me and is like, ""Emma. What are you doing?"" And I'm like, ""Ignoring you. What are you doing?"" And then they're like, ""Oh."" ""I'm trying to teach the class and you're being a little bit distracting because everybody can tell that you're not paying attention to what I'm saying."" And then I respond, ""Okay, it's not my fault that no one gives a f**k about what you're talking about. I'm sorry that I don't care. I'm really sorry like, I'm like, ""Next time make your lectures more interesting and maybe we can talk. But like, the teacher gets mad at me and kind of yells at me in front of the whole class for goofing off on my computer. And then I'm like, ""Oh, s**t."" You know? Sorry! Trying to act like this doesn't happen to me every day. And then, you know. That's definitely one of the more awkward things that happens to me at school. But, I don't really get embarrassed easily because my entire life is an embarrassment. So, moving on. Can we be friends? Like, we're the same person. I'm pretty sure it's destiny. Yes! If you were to get a face tattoo, what would it be of? Personally, I don't really like tattoos. They're just not for me. You know, as Kim Kardashian would say, ""Don't put a bumper sticker on a Bentley."" So I would never get a face tattoo. But instead, I would just get a tramp stamp because I feel like tramp stamps are more classy and versatile. I don't know. That's just what I would do. Next. Would you rather never drink coffee again? Or, only be allowed to watch the Minions movie and nothing else for the rest of your life? Both of those options are so.. absolutely horrible to me that I would rather die than have to choose. Because the minions movie is f***ing annoying, and not being able to drink coffee ever again would be absolutely tragic. Therefore, I don't want to choose. I would rather die. Would you rather give up coffee or YouTube? I would say, out of everything in this entire universe, the only thing that I would give up coffee for is YouTube. (aww) Yeah, I know. I'm not gonna lie, you guys are pretty awesome. And I wouldn't wanna lose this connection that we have, just for a drink. If you were to be an animal, what would you be? If I was gonna be an animal, I want to either be a chimpanzee/ape because they're like the closest to humans. So they're still kind of smart. And also, I heard monkeys throw their own s**t at people as, like, self-defense and that sounds, honestly, really dope to me, and I would love to try that out. So, probably a monkey or an ape. Or, I would want to be like a goldfish because goldfish don't really have brains. Like, they do, but it, like, doesn't really work so well. They're not very smart, you know? They're not the most intelligent creatures in the world. Like, talk about giving no f**ks, like, a goldfish gives no f**ks. And, I would love to experience that feeling. And if you die or something, or like, you know you go to a new home, like some like somebody adopts you from the pet store, you don't care. You're just chilling! The second part of this question, ""Why does cheese smell so bad?"" Um honestly, I have no clue. I bet there's like a reason for it. Actually, let me Google it. Why does cheese smell so bad? Bacteria that makes up the starter culture helps determine a cheese's taste, texture, and smell. For example, some bacteria- I don't care. What the people at your school think about your YouTube channel? P.S. I freaking love your channel. Keep up the good work. Thank you, girl. You're awesome. Honestly, I started this channel during the summer and, therefore I haven't been at school for people to, like, tell me what they think about my channel. But, if you go to my school and you watch my channel, comment down below what you think of it. Because I don't know. What is your favorite thing about the Bay area? Um, I'd say my favorite thing about the bay area would have to be.. probably the fact that I live so close to San Francisco or, the fact that I live really close to the ocean, even though the ocean is really cold. But, it's still fun you know? Because you can just hang out at the beach and like, not swim. Or, if you want to swim you can swim. But, you can only be in for like five minutes. But still fun though. Still fun. Would you rather drink a spoonful of vinegar or a spoonful of mustard? Whichever you choose, do it on camera. Brb. So, I'd have to say that I like mustard probably more than vinegar. I'm also doing this on my bed, which is just a bad idea because if this spills anywhere, it'll stain and, that's just not fun. Let's just jump right into it. You know, I wouldn't say that that was painfully unpleasant. But, that really wasn't fun. But, if I'm gonna be completely honest with you right now, when I was little, I used to be obsessed with mustard. Like no joke, obsessed with it. To a point where like, I would eat it on its own. I would literally go to my fridge at night--this is when I was like six by the way-- I go to my fridge, and I take the mustard out, and I just squirt it onto my finger and eat it for, like hours. If you had a boat, what would you name it? I've honestly never thought about naming a boat, but maybe I'd call it, ""Emma's Pimpin' Yacht, B***h"" So, if anybody wants to buy me a yacht so that I can, like, name it that just let me know. I'm totally down. I will set up a PayPal and a P.O. box that you can send checks to me, and donate, so that I can buy a boat, and name it, ""Emma's Pimpin' Yacht, B***h"" Because honestly, that's just everything. Have you ever considered trying different kind of coffee? I have not considered trying another coffee. That's just not... Why would I ever do that? There's just no reason for me to ever want to do that. Like, I don't want to switch it up. That just would be..wrong. So, no. I would say I have never considered getting another coffee drink. By the way if you guys are new here, and you don't know what my coffee order is, I get an iced almond milk latte from everywhere that I go. And you might ask, ""Well, what do you do if the place doesn't have almond milk?"" I leave. I will only drink a latte if it's made with almond milk. I will not do soy milk. I will not do rice milk. I will not do oat milk. I will not do cashew milk. I will not do regular dairy milk. I will only do almond milk. So, that's that. On a scale of 1-10, how much do you miss Vine? This question is upsetting to me because I literally lived for Vine. Vine was my absolute favorite form of social media when I was younger. I absolutely lived, breathed for Vine. I didn't even make Vines. Like, I think I made, like, weird a** Vines that were like, not even funny and like, they got like one like, and no one ever revined them. Like, they were really bad. But, I loved watching Vines, like literally my entire humor is Vine. I love Vine. So, on a scale of 1-10, I would have to say 21. What is your favorite form of potatoes? Honestly, I like every single form of potatoes because they're just delicious. But either breakfast potatoes, hashbrowns, french fries, or curly fries. All of the above are really good. Potatoes, I don't discriminate. If you're a potato, you best believe I'm gonna eat yo' a**. Oh, no. I didn't mean like that. Yeah, so that was all the questions I have for today. Thank you so much for stopping by. I hope you enjoyed this video, this Q&A. I love Q&A's. I hope you love them too. And if you do, and you love this one, give it a thumbs up, subscribe to my channel, comment down below anything you want. I love you all so much.

I LOVE U ALL MORE THAN U COULD EVER UNDERSTAND!

you know what that means that means driving vlogs are back I'm starting out today going to a gym because the grind never stops I was just excited to be getting in my car for like the first time since I've been home from vacation and I thought what better way to celebrate then two frickin car vlogs everybody's favourite here right now I'm going to the gym really quick and then after that I think what I'm doing is my friend texted me yesterday and said hey let's go to the mall and then I said okay so I'm probably gonna go to the mall later with my friend and then after that if all goes as planned I might do a shoot with my friend Lily which I've done a few I think I've done two shoots with her and included the footage in vlog I just wanted to say good morning check in say hi oh my god it's so windy well if you can hear me it's arm day you know gotta get those guns going yay can't wait I love this love exercising so fun and exciting I am a fitness guru the wheels in my car are so scraped because every time I try to park I hit the curb so that's cute and classy right I love that so number one I showered at the gym which is always a horrible experience because you know I don't like showering in public places it just isn't something I enjoy so you can blue be honest but you know it's alright I mean it wasn't that bad it kind of grosses me out to think that like hundreds of other people shower in the same shower as me if that makes sense but you know what who cares now I'm going to my friend Grace's house yeah I'm dropping my car off at her house and then we're going to drive to a mall and just go shopping a little bit because personally I haven't been shopping in a very long time so I'm pretty pumped about it to update you in my life I have like less than a week left until school starts and I am sad like to say the least I'm sad but it's going to be okay going into I'm going to be jr. and also my posting schedule not that anyone cares but I'm not going to be

while doing so so wish me luck when I go shopping today with my friend grace I need to get jeans that don't have rips in them because I go to a private school and we have to wear uniforms Monday through Thursday and then on Friday we have free dress and for free dressed days you can't wear leggings you can't wear sweatpants and you can't wear ripped jeans you can only wear jeans that don't have Rick's in them and that's it like that's the only option of pants that you can wear so meaning that I need to find some cute fun exciting jeans that don't have reps in it which is just impossible like I only own jeans with rips that's just so frustrating to me that I can't wear any of my cute ripped jeans oh I have to wear frickin non ripped jeans what even is that oh my god don't even get me started it is not it is me on but today I'm going to be on the hunt for some cute jeans that don't up risk and wish me luck I think that I can probably find some but I want them to be comfy too because I go to an all-girls school so like I don't need to be super cute I'm not trying to impress anybody or questions before you even ask yes going to all-girls schools I'd stop I miss boys okay but it's actually not that bad I'll just tell you a little bit about going to an all-girls school right now just in case you don't know anything about it I mean it's nice because like you don't - I literally look like a piece of crap every day at school and I don't care doesn't bother me I'm not trying to impress anyone you can like focus more on school and stuff like that because you're not like focusing on like the hot guy sitting next to you you know what I mean overall though it still kind of does stuff because you don't get that normal high school vibe like all but oh my god like my crush sitting across the lunchroom and we're like looking at each other like I cannot relate to that and it makes me very sad but I don't even know what it's like to go to schools guys because I haven't gone to school science for like three years since middle school so I don't even remember what it's like probably it must be nice okay I can't relate that's my little awkward school rant sorry for rambling hopefully that wasn't too boring and I'll see you when I get to Grace's house I hate driving behind buses it's my biggest pet peeve and I hate it I literally drove behind like eight different buses today and I'm just fed up okay that's all I am with grace I'm just you know I need to like introduce you guys to grace oh you had to have some context as to who she is first question

get a phat ticket because she literally parked like right here just like here's the road she just parked like right here yeah that's probably not allowed but there's nowhere else to park so you know you got to do what you got to do so we're at this really dull place where you can see the whole entire Bay Bridge and I'm not going to lie to you right now it looks pretty frickin dope it's in the most random place literally ever this is like not an area that like we're allowed to be in as you can see private property look at that we finesse for the holy [ __ ] really whoa what have I done like

I know look I look a little bit tragic right now but I just wanted to update you and tell you that I hate my outfit today and I regret this I just regret everything about it I thought it was going to be cool and it just isn't so I'm pissed and sad but you know what life goes on Wow Thanks what's sticking out and it's like this big fat wire and when I walk past it it put me straight in the depo are

GUYS YAYAYAY WE R SO CLOSE TO 10K SUBS!!! THANK U SO MUCH I LOVE U ALL TO THE MOON AND BACK",2017-08-12T15:05:29Z,89878,2721369,2236,"No, I'm not okay. Thanks for asking. I was-( DOG BARKS). Just shut up, please can you just shut it please? If you're wondering where I just came from I just came from the dentist ummmm You know I never really hated the dentist before it was fine. You know it was like you go in They do the job and you leave but today it was a different. It was a different experience for me It was a little bit less easy today I went in and they looked at my teeth, and they said Emma your teeth they look great They look healthy, and you're doing awesome I can tell that you're flossing which is weird cause I barely ever floss But whatever and you know they had some nice things to say but a few minutes into the appointment They were looking at my teeth, and they said ""yeah, do you drink coffee?"" and I said *sips iced almond milk coffee* What do you mean do I drink coffee? Of course! They're like. Oh, okay Well, it seems that your teeth are starting to look a little bit stained from coffee which makes sense because I have you know anywhere from one to ten coffees per day coffee Everything about it is great. I love it. Okay. I love everything about cof- I I love everything about coffee like I love every aspect of it I love the caffeine aspect as if I need to be any more energized than I already am. I really don't but it's fun for me. It is one of my favorite things in life. I love going to cafes I love drinking it I love coffee when the dentist told me that my teeth are starting to get stained from the coffee of course I was concerned because My one true  love in life is now harming me that's something you never want to hear it's like me and coffee We have a great relationship the dentist was basically trying to tell me that me and coffees relationship is actually toxic That's just that's the last thing I want to hear I'm not going to stop drinking coffee And I'm not going to brush my teeth after every time I drink a cup of coffee I'd be brushing my teeth ten times a day That's a waste of my time! So I decided you know I need to take some preventitive measures I can't just let this continue so today I decided that I would google it, and I try to find some cures for coffee stains and I found some hacks diy hacks basically ways that I can get rid of the freaking copy things because God knows I need it So the first diy hack that I'm going to be trying today is called Charcoal Toothpick toothpaste Which I have everything here, so let's just jump right in it That was really loud. Well, it wants me to do like exact measurements and stuff like that But I just don't really want to do that. That's just too much work Why why am-? four tablespoons of coconut oil ten drops of peppermint essential oil No, okay. Well, I'm skipping that steps up too much work two tablespoons of baking soda Just get it pour it in I don't I'm not wasting any time to Tune a lot whatever. I'm doing my best okay, so the last ingredient for this one activated charcoal I don't have like just loose charcoal I only have them in these capsules, so I have to basically figure out a way to open up the capsules So of course. I'm just gonna use scissors so if you do not I think that's enough ah oh God no that looks disgusting look at that. That's not cute brush your teeth with it so fair enough blue no, or the Showbox oh This is not good. This is no this isn't worth it um you know what I'm really trying. Okay? I'm trying okay, so um I'm back in my teeth look exactly the same no difference you wouldn't think that this would be that bad But the thing that's so gross about it. Is that it's mainly baking soda There's so much baking soda in it that it literally tastes So gross because if anyone knows what baking soda tastes like you know, it's just not it does not taste good this stuff No, I would not recommend this I really believed in this because you know what Instagram Enjoyed those like charcoal toothpaste ad saying that it's like it works You know well that it didn't so I'm not very happy right now But I'm willing to try another one because do you know what giving up is for freaking losers? And I don't get the next one is basically the same Except you add tumeric, so let's do it the thing about tumeric tumeric That it's yellow so that doesn't really make any sense because why would if you're trying to make your teeth whiter? Why would you add swimming the plo? I don't know. I dunno what maybe I just can't understand the signs of it because I'm not smart enough, okay? Sorry next we have baking so that I had a really bad experience Baking soda last time so I'm not very excited about this, but I'm not even at this point I'm not even following the like recipe like how much you're supposed to have of each thing because I really just don't feel like it Okay So the Indian food a little bit, which is good I actually like Indian food so so far so good I honestly are highly doubt that this one's going to be any better than the last one so this looks Disgusting this looks like a pumpkin baby food mixed with diarrhea my favorite. This is my Spit cup you know because like you gotta spit it out, right? Okay, oh You're gonna. Oh, oh my God it tastes horrible, okay? No, look is wow this is disgusting okay? No oh, no How is this helping me look at it? How would this help me? do you Know I'm so sorry you have to see that that is so gross like I want to play it off the video like I feel Horrible for you right now like that you want to see that that's disgusting. I'm leaving now I Am Beyond confused right now, okay? Let me explain I go into the bathroom and rinse my mouth out because I was disgusted But I look in the mirror and my teeth look whiter like this actually worked I can fully conclude that tumeric coconut oil and baking Soda actually works You know what? I'll be darned. Okay? My cheese stain look cleaner a little bit less stained not by much But definitely a little bit the next hack is a little bit gross, and I thought that these blocks - tasted bad but this one's probably going to be the worst and that's because Vinegar Soho, basically what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to take vinegar put it on some cotton Pad things Just clean your piece with it We'll see how that goes just when it seems kind of like idiotic to me because Vinegar is an acid right wait Let me Google it I have thought that like a cynic things were bad for your teeth enamel So this is really make any sense to me why you're going to rub straight up like vinegar on your teeth I don't really get it, but we're going to do it anyway, so let's just do it. Let's just jump right into it. Oh Oh my God, it's stinging ah I've so many cussing my mouth and it's stinging them okay ah I? feel like an idiot Okay, I'm done with this one out my entire face is stinging okay. Hold on Okay, so this last one uh my teeth look exactly the same and now my entire face sting I know I seem like I'm being dramatic but try this at home, and then tell me I'm being dramatic Okay, try to help you will actually don't do this because it was really waste of time, but you know What is the Torah' clump this baby food looking actually worked try it at home? You know it didn't make a huge difference But I could definitely tell my teeth did look whiter you know if coffee stains my teeth That's just the risk I have to take I don't care life happens. You know you can't stop drinking coffee Because things because it's bad for you good. It's b nor your health I don't care that's fine because coffee makes me smile And so do you so if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up subscribe you ate it Subscribe my channel comment down below anything you want I love you all so much, and I appreciate all of you, and I'll see you soon peace out.

i love each and everyone of you SO FRICKIN MUCH THANK U FOR BEING U",2017-08-10T13:42:07Z,84751,2419162,2714,"This is the only hoodie I packed on this vacation, so I've been wearing it for the past five days. If you're sick of seeing me wear it Sorry... Deal with it So it's raining men out here hallelujah *plays It's Raining Men* But I want coffee, so I'm taking the risk of going outside in this horrible weather for that. I also haven't had any coffee yet today, so I'm in an absolutely sh*tty mood. Don't talk to me till I've had my morning coffee. *pained scream* I need it right now. They gave me the coffee, but they didn't give me a straw. They didn't give me a straw. How am I supposed to -- *loud slurp* How am I supposed to -- Are you freaking kidding? (dramatic music plays) As you can see I'm profusely bleeding from my forehead right now. I'm losing a lot of blood. I'm lightheaded I think that the end is near. This vlog might end here. It's debatable because I might die from this. Please. I'm going to start a GoFundMe down below to help pay for reparations and the doctor bills that it will take to heal this injury. Thank you so much for being understanding, my eyebrow looks like absolute sh*t. if all goes as planned, I will be the first person to actually die from a bleeding pimple. You know, there's pros and cons to this situation. Pros? I might be in the Guinness Book of World records. Cons? I'm dead. Today, I went and I got coffee, then we went to the grocery store, and then I went to Rite Aid, I did a bunch of stuff, but it's 2 o'clock, and I haven't eaten yet today And I feel like -- I don't even -- I don't know. This is really bad. I do not feel good I feel -- I feel like I'm gonna die... I feel like a demented rock. (NOPE) All right, guys. Here's the deal: Today is my last day in Maine. I'm going home tomorrow I'd be lying if I said I wasn't kind of sad about it. It was a great trip, I had a great time. I did some vlogs. I did some storytimes. I got initiated into a biker gang I don't know, a lot of things happened to me and it was awesome. It was a great trip. I felt like I needed to do something that would, like, allow me to remember this trip for the rest of my life You know? What better way to do that than to buy things? from here that could remind me of this trip? So, I went to the store, a little general store down the street, and I picked up a few things that I felt like, could help me remember...this trip by. So, basically this is a An ""Attempt to Remember My Trip to Maine"" haul. The first thing I got is kind of complicated, but just stick with me here. The first thing I got is... This postcard, that says ""Maine got the blues"" with a blue lobster on it, now -- I would argue that I am quite blue that I have to leave this trip and so I thought this postcard really matched my emotions. But, the main reason why I bought this is because my plan is to write myself a letter on this, so that later Every time I'm missing this trip, I can read this, and then it'll remind me of the trip. (angelic harp) *distant* To Emma, From: Emma as you know I just got my license because I'm 16 and so, driving is one of my new obsessions. Because of that I decided to get myself the most creative, innovative, and amazing keychain that I could find. So, I bought this keychain. It's pink, and it says ""Maine"" on it. It's a little bear with the limbs Swiggle everywhere. And I just was like, this is not the keychain I would have normally picked out, you know? I'm not one who even really likes keychains. This one really seemed special to me. I don't know, I just thought it was like, really Grateful Dead vibes. and I was just... really digging it. So, expect to see this bad boy on my car keys for like the rest of my life. Now, my favorite thing that I got when I was shopping in the gift shop was this mini little glass, I don't know what you would use this kind of small glass for? I don't really know, but on it It says ""bottoms up"", and it has a bunch of moose butts on it How dope is that? So, basically I got this. I just thought this was really cute and I don't really know what I'd use this for, because it's so small. Like, you know? You can't have a substantial amount of any sort of liquid in this so, kind of at a loss as to what this is for but, my idea was to use it for iced coffee! See?! Now, I can drink my iced coffee in extremely small portions, and it's just 10 times more fun! Bottoms up, bitch! Okay, next! Next thing I got was this shirt. Don't tell my parents that I bought a second shirt because they probably would be annoyed with me, But I don't care. I got this shirt... says Port Clyde, Maine on the boob and then on the back it has this cute little design I bought this shirt earlier in the week, but I decided that one wasn't enough, and I wanted to buy another one. I've literally worn this for the past, like, five days because what I'm on vacation I don't -- I'm basically in my PJs all the time because I feel like it. You know? I just like it, okay It's comfortable, and it's my favorite t-shirt brand -- Comfort Colors. Actually, originally, when I bought this shirt, I was like ""You know what? That's all I'm gonna get, I'm not going to buy anything else."" ""I don't need any other shirts."" You know, but then I saw this, and I was like, ""Emma, you need it."" so I got another shirt. UM let's just keep this purchase between you and me just because you know I don't know I just My parents they probably be like Emma Why are you spending your money like that, and then I'd be like oh no parents. This is my money. This is your money Last thing I got I actually didn't buy, but it was actually a gift from a local kid who lives here? Who actually watches my blog now if you saw my blog called? Minion banana or something like that then you would have seen that in that vlog. I was in the little gift shop general store That's like down the street, and I saw this shirt and Apparently that kid watched my blog and later came up to me and bought me the shirt What an angel right even though I hate minions it was the nicest gesture ever and it made me smile So I'm gonna insert the footage right now of him giving me that shirt This kid just got me a gift, and I'm very excited He's about to present it to me right now. (It has to do with your vlogs- the kid) alright, so let's see what it is I'm very scared. What is it on with the kid? Oh? My god, I have to hug you for this So that was my main hall. I kind of don't want to end, but here. I am it's ending I'm sad about it, and I don't want to go home because you know what that means when I get home I have one week left until school starts and I have barely done any of my summer reading and you know what I don't plan on doing it anytime soon, so That's not good. There's spark notes for a reason. You know what I mean. I hope you enjoyed my haul if you did You're welcome. Thanks, I don't know Hey, Emma get over here I hope you enjoyed the last main vlog if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel Comment down below anything you want. I'm sad that I'm going home, but the grind doesn't stop"

ur awesome ily",2017-08-06T13:59:23Z,39645,853640,989,good afternoon vlog I woke up got coffee of course didn't film it though then I went for a run and now I'm laying in my bed I was laying here and I was like I'm literally gonna fall asleep which is bad because it's like 1:00 p.m. and I shouldn't be falling asleep right now so I think I need another coffee it wouldn't be an Emma vlog if I didn't have an absurd amount of coffee in it you know what I mean it just wouldn't be right one more thing I want to talk about before I get my coffee is that something really upsetting is happening to me right now I'm extremely upset I just want to talk about it with you guys because maybe you guys can relate or help me cope with what I'm going through so here's my iphone charger as you can see it has a little turtleneck forming it's completely destroyed it just isn't looking so hot and that chargers life is coming to an end me and that charger have been through everything together from trips to late nights on Instagram and Twitter and just like charging my phone when no one else could you know that charger was always there for me that charger had my back and I had its back the charger is dead the million face wearing my favorite socks because mood okay this is walking and I came around the corner and I saw these and I genuinely got they're real and I actually screamed a little bit how's your day going sir so we'll go look at these over-the-knee boots that is trendy I don't even know my Pinterest boards are quaking oh my god yes so are you guys just like the biker gang yeah what does it take like how can I join the bike gang just wondering your tomboy dang it oh my god I love your sauce you love my sauce yeah it's beautiful yeah oh so glad somebody likes my sauce everybody else thinks they're inappropriate that's lame right you all people are on their bike and they're gonna go get me a bike but have to run to keep up with them right now Africa tired and aside we want the Frick so apparently his bike are in a very remote location am i excited yes in my nervous of course I don't worry it's gonna be a lip bike my name is James and I'm the biggest savage here I'm freakin riding in style right now Wow so basically they're gonna initiate me into their biker gang right now I said run home run back to my rental house and get another camera because my camera died and they are about to initiate me into the frickin biker gang gang [Applause] I'm in I am investing special she's got wicked tires good luck if you want to please all for me I'm down up it's like dog thing as you can see to visit my dad because he's painting a painting right there there he is it's looking pretty good what do you have to say about it thank you yeah I'm happy with it good yeah yeah nice way to spend a foggy day okay agreed you want to see more my dad's art or anything like that yeah the YouTube and Instagram I'll leave them in the description of the video coffee sauce yeah that's about it I'm actually going to get my third coffee of the day each coffee is five dollars though so this could easily add up but you know what I'm not thinking about that because I'm on vacation and coffee is a necessity and it keeps me going it keeps me alive it keeps me thriving so that's the verdict as you can see it's very foggy outside you can't even freaking you can't see anything but I actually like weather like this because it gives us like chill vibe you just feel like chill I'm thinking of it maybe I'll jump into the ocean at some point today but if you saw last vlog I was very cold then you would know that Guinea and the lawyer here is not all fun and games getting in the water here is an extreme trek and an extreme experience and I don't know if I have the mental capacity to do it today so but yeah it's freaking cold and I don't know I just don't know okay yesterday I was outside at night and I didn't put on long pants which was a huge mistake a very extremely bad and huge mistake because I don't know if you can see but I have these scratch marks all over my legs and all of these freaking mosquito bites also not trying to TMI but I do have a freaking big mosquito bite on my butt cheek and it's extremely itchy and not fun so I'm gonna need to start using bug repellent and I now have at least 30 not even a joke 30 mosquito bites and there's deimos itchy things and I'm in utter pain constantly if you know white is so big that it looks like it's like a bump coming out of my leg it's like a bump coming out look at it what what's happening alright so here's the freaking deal it's about 5:30 p.m. right now and the weather outside is very very very very gloomy temperature is doable I mean it's more it's comfortable there's no wind or so the weather report is in and supposedly there is supposed to be a thunderstorm any minute now and I'm not too pumped for that because that is kind of scary and I don't wanna get electrocuted so wish me luck for everybody who consistently watches my blogs obviously I haven't been home therefore I can't do a driving vlog and that is really sad for all of us I think because driving gloves are so fun but this is as close as we're going to get oh my god oh my soft Han that is not good that is a horrible thought Han but I'm really not feeling this right now it is cold you know what okay I I really before I get in though I'm just going to like touch my toes in it oh this is gonna be hard this is getting away I actually don't know if I can do it are you going to do it this is the coldest I've ever felt it before I told you guys that I would get in right now and so I'm not going to skip out it's not doing I can't back out now you know I can just break promises like that Emma who do you think you are okay so I think what I just decided was I'm not gonna like ease my way and do it like I usually do oh here it comes again don't usually like walking slowly so that I can kind of like ease into the you know ease into the temperature I'm going to run straight and not stop do you know what I mean it's going to keep running I'm not stopping I'm just going to run straight in just like that I'm gonna run straight in just like that dog I'm very nervous [Music] Oh what did you step on step on what is it I don't know look we was huge I'm not okay so I've calmed down now a little bit I was like running straight in so I wasn't like looking at where my feet were stepping so I stepped on some sort of animal don't know what it was but it was like the size of my foot so when he stepped on it it wasn't like a small little animal it was like at least the size of my side I don't even I don't even know if this happened but it really freaking scared me and I didn't even see what it was so I had no clue what it was but now my dad is going to run into the water the same way that I did and he probably won't step on an animal because he's lucky dang it not the better no it's not afraid of the temperature I'm afraid of that creature that I stepped on because I think that did mad at me now he or she is so I gonna come back try to find me maybe you'll bite my ankles and maybe you'll try to bite my butt cheek and everybody already knows and I have enough mosquito bites the last thing I need it's a creature in oceans come up here and bite me even more okay I have enough rashes I'm itchy enough right now no no do I I'll kind of feel good now I'm done sounds traumatic in all aspects of the word and I need to go to my spouse today's vlog I hope you enjoyed it if you did give video thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want I like you all a lot more than I like the freaking sea creature that tried to bite me earlier see you next time [Music]

Check out his channel!! - https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-08-02T15:26:26Z,94637,2982654,3163,"Right now I'm in maine obviously. I don't live in maine so I'm traveling here to maine with my family I had one of the most traumatic travel days of my entire life And I didn't vlog any of it because you know what it was just too traumatic And I'll tell you the story because I feel like you know what, why not you know also? I'll tell you the story so here's what happened it all started out at 11:00 a.m.. At Sfo, San Francisco airport California no big deal that's where I live, okay, whatever I don't live at the airport, but you know what I mean my flight was that like I don't know 11 a.m. My first flight was from Sfo to Chicago airport and then from Chicago To maine that was the plan no big deal before my flight in Chicago I supposed to have like a 45-minute layover Which is a short layover, but we're like you know what we can make it happen. Forty, You know 45 minutes We can just bolt that's not a long layover. So we were a little bit worried. You know we'll see We'll see what happens our flight from Sfo to Chicago. It's a little bit delayed So we're like you know what a little bit stressed out. What we're like You know what we can still make it. We can still make it. We'll make it half decent flight Nothing crazy happened but then all of a Sudden the flight lands and we get a announcement on the overhead thing and they announce that there's a medical thing going on and we were going to have to taxi for longer we weren't going to be like leaving the plane for like another like 20 minutes and At that time our flight was going to leave in 20 minutes Like our flight was going to take off the ground in 20 minutes, and we're like What are we going to do. Surrender to the fact that we're going to miss our flight like all right? You know what we're gonna miss our flight So we looked online and um we saw that that was the last flight going to Maine tonight So we're like you know what we're screwed. We're gonna have to stay at a hotel in Chicago. We're like What are we going to do? 20 minutes, we have 20 minutes? We're like how are we going to do this right now? We're like standing in the aisles of the plane just like waiting for like the paramedics to leave the plane and we're so stressed out Because we feel bad because of course, whoever is having a medical issue. I mean heart goes out to them I don't know they're okay by the way But it was just stressful because we're like we want to get off the plane but at the same time You know you want to have sympathy for whatever the situation is and we want to like ask if we can get off the plane Earlier because you know our flight leaves in 20 minutes It leaves in 20 minutes, but we were the, we were on the last row of the plane We were literally the last row there was not one row behind us We were the last one the 53rd row that was us. So we had, there was just, it was crazy, technically We're the ones who would get off the plane last. At this point, me and my dad we're just Pushing everybody out of the way we're like nope, we're nope. No, no. Sorry my flight leaves in 20 minutes We're trying to make it. Everybody's  like you're not even going to make it. We're like oh, honey We're going to make it okay, no joke We're in like terminal one, like our plane landed in terminal one not only this is like the big-, one of the biggest airports like In the U.S. okay and we have to get from terminal 1 to terminal 2 in like 15 minutes before our plane takes off not before boarding like our plane our plane was already boarded at the time and we're not even Off the plane yet and our plane was boarding and it wasn't like oh
You know you just run to the next gate like we had to run all the way from one terminal to the next. This point we're like all hope is lost, we're like I don't even know, I don't even know. To make matters worse on our like ticket that we printed out in The beginning of the trip it said that like the gate was not yet assigned So we didn't even know what gate our thing was at. All we knew was it was in terminal 2 and we were in terminal 1 so we're like okay, what, I don't even know. We asked some guy to look up our flight, and so he looks at our flight He worked at the airport, can either take a shuttle or you can walk and it's going to take 20 minutes either way and me And my dad were like we're going to freaking run this point We have 15 minutes we;re like our plane is going to leave in 15 minutes And we have to no joke run all the way across this airport, okay? So I kid you not me and my dad run over a mile with all of our own carry-on luggage We're running through the airport like just running pushing past people. It's so crowded I'm like dying like running in general is horrible, but like running with like freaking backpack. Just filled with a bunch of stuff So heavy literally running as fast as we possibly can we ran for like 15 minutes straight up running, and I'm like That's like enough exercise for like the entire year and our gate is like F21. We see a gate and it's F1 We have to go to F21, so we're like alright. You know what we're close right our plane is leaving in two minutes We're like no, we just ran like for ten minutes. There's no way that plane is leaving without us There's no way we're going to let that plane leave so we freaking keep going We're like you know what we're our plane is leaving two minutes We need to keep going my dad's ahead of me at this point cuz I'm just dying like I'm so red I'm literally, sweat is dripping down. I'm red, like at this point. It's like who even knows, like I don't even know what's going on. I guess at this point I'm just like I don't even know what, who even am I I like I don't even know if nothing matters to me except for getting on this flight. We have two minutes to get there It's all or nothing right now every ounce of energy I had was I was putting it towards getting on that plane I was going to get on that freaking plane. It was the last thing I did in my life I was literally gonna walk out onto the tarmac and hold onto the freaking airplane wing until they noticed me and let me on the Plane, I don't even care. I was like no, this is my number one priority in my life right now We're running through the F gates like F1 F2 F3 F4, then there's a food court for like no Joke one minute just the biggest food court You've ever seen and I'm just like running past this food court, and it's just like the gates just end Then finally we pass through the freakin food court, and it's like okay F7 F8, F9 We just keep running. The last F gate It was like F21 was like the last freaking F gate And just like never and it was huge the airport is huge and each gate was so big it was, it was Unbelievable one minute until our flight is supposed to like to leave like the doors are closed in like one minute and we're just like We're not going to make it my dad just starts going. He's like he's at this point He's just full full-on sprinting and I'm like I can't even do this I'm like I can't freakin Sprint. I've been running for about 15 minutes with a backpack. I'm dead right now So my dad runs up ahead. He's like very far ahead at this point. I'm like freaking. I'm back here, I'm like, sorry No, he turns the corner, and I see him like pop out his head, and he's like thumbs up And I'm like no freakin way. I'm like. What does this mean? I run up to him and I look around the corner And there's no one else in the gate the gate is completely empty And there's one guide at the counter, and I see my dad scanning the ticket and I'm like Halla-Frickin-elujah  like literally Yes, I believe like I don't know and then I asked my dad later. I'm like was he just standing there He's like no, the guy that was like checking the ticket He did one like last call where he like stuck his head out of the door like for one last second before he was about To go in and shut the door for good He was doing his last calling literally looking out to be like is anybody else here all right shut the door he looks out and my dad comes Around the corner right at that second and freaking catches the guy, right? Moments before he was about to close the door literally if we would have ran slower for like three more seconds if we if The time would have been shifted three seconds like later We wouldn't made it on like that's how Frickin unreal it was we get on this plane And I tell you what I have never been happier to be on a plane in my entire life It was probably one of the best feelings i've ever felt in my life. We get on the plane. I'm sitting there I'm like do you know what I'm sweating. I feel disgusting but I'm a champion right now This is like one of the best moments of my life. I was so proud We just freaking savage that everybody was like you're going to miss your flight Everybody was like you're not going to make it just don't even try and we're like no, we're going to freaking try We made it on the plane and look where I am now if we wouldn't have ran I wouldn't even be up here right now. I'd still be in Chicago F that no, so anyway that was freaking crazy Um I hope you're still freaking not bored 'cause I would be bored if I was you. You thought it ended there, It didn't. We land and our luggage didn't Come basically it didn't have enough time to get to the plane our luggage was still in Chicago, and it still is right now So today is the next day. It's like 11 a.m. And I'm still wearing the same shirt that I was wearing and I'm still wearing the same pants and the same shoes and same Everything I haven't changed since yesterday. I feel disgusting and I'm waiting for my luggage to come it's supposed to come today They're driving it to us. We don't have to go back to the airport. Thank God just a quick shout out to United Airlines They told us they like yeah, we forgot your luggage We'll drive it to you tomorrow. No big deal, but for now the gave both me and my dad these united water bottles, okay? Thank you united. Thank you so much for setting us up with a flight. That was like impossible They like set up you know a 48 minute layover and it was our choice You know we didn't have to take that But we did and they really didn't plan that out well because that's an impossible thing to do. 48 minute layover There's no way you can make it like there's no way, we'll never do that again But hey, you know what through all of that, through all the stress and pain and tears and blood and sweat We've got these water bottles so right now. I'm going to do a little haul for you all Do you know what you don't even care? This is boring. It comes with all the things you're going to need deodorant, toothpaste Lotion, tic-Tac, a toothbrush even, I mean it's totally cute But I'm like you know united you freaking lost my luggage And now you're giving me this like you think this is really enough like do you know what you just put me through I almost Have like a heart attack like eight times throughout that travel experience and like you give me this and think it's okay and then you Lose my freaking luggage and leave it in Chicago, and then you give me this and think of it It's all going to be cool, and it's all going to be Dandy and all right I'm sorry united, but life doesn't work like that. You know united they've had a few scandals recently They just think that they can just hand out these water bottles, and think everybody's going to like them again not really how it works this is kind of cool, whatever but You know you need to work on your thing you just it's not. Moral of the story is if you think you're going to miss Your flight just go, just try just you know what never give up because you never know like if you just tell yourself I'm not going to make it we defied all odds And like I also ran like that's also defying all odds, but now I'm here and that's good. That was my story I hope you're not bored and if you are. I'm sorry. I don't know"

just wanted to say i love you guys SO MUCH. thats all. xo.",2017-07-31T15:04:19Z,68730,2954432,1803,"Good morning-afternoon, everybody. Welcome to today's vlog It's about two thirty or something right now, and I'm starting the vlog now. Earlier today, I... ...Well nobody cares about what I did earlier because I didn't film it, so I'm not going to include that part but right now I'm near the Beach, and it's foggy extremely extremely foggy Obviously, I'm not gonna like go try to swim in the ocean or anything like that Even though originally I was like you know what I'll jump in the ocean why not, but no it's a little bit too chilly for that So I'm not down...Um also the water is cold anyways in Northern, California even during the summer It's just so cold so I wasn't...you know...I'm not down all right. I'm out down right now I'm at this coffee place called granolas. Its... ...cute so I'm to go in and get a coffee per usual, and there's this like little trailer thing outside That's just open and you can just sit in it and just drink your coffee And it's pretty dope so I'll show you that and then after that I'm going to check out a thrift store That's near here because it's really cool. It looks pretty cool I have no clue, but if it's going to have anything good, but I'll check it out. You know might as well Look, I really need to get lunch because I'm starving because I just haven't eaten for like three hours And that's way too long for me, and I like to eat every 20 minutes just kidding but like not though Let's go get coffee wooo! Um, Wow could spot this building from a mile away Got my drink but look at this cute little like trailer. They have outside of the coffee place I I mean like This is just like...you can just go in... so freaking cool holy crap I'm literally just going to sit here and drink my coffee. So dope! So I just enjoyed a nice little coffee in that little trailer thing And that's Frickin dope like I don't even know what it is, but I loved it. It was very rich It was very rich coffee, but it was good. So now. I'm the head over to the thrift shop I've never been here before but it looks good I don't really know how to get there, and I should be mapping it, but instead, I'm vlogging because priorities I think if I just take a left right there Pfft, I have no clue. I don't know how much you can see is that little trailer thing But it's so friggin cool Imagine how cool it would be to have one of those at your own Disposal and then you could just use it whenever you wanted and you could just like go on I don't know, road trips with that thing And just frickin' like take naps all the time okay? Oh, it's go time baby. Holy crap okay? ooo this is an intense time okay? Yes? I say turn left go Split second decision time to turn left? What was that a good decision, probably not should I be going left for now? I don't know you know that feeling when you're like unsure if you have to if you can do u-turns and then you can and You're just like. Oh great. I don't have to break any laws. Yeah, okay? I need to map this Um, I'll see you when I get to the thrift store because I need help. Right when I turned off the vlogging camera I found the spot I didn't even have to Frickin map it skills $0.99 store and up. It's like not even a dollar store It's just 99 cents in okay So it could be 99 cents, or it could be more than 99 cents, so I don't really get the point of that store But anyways come yes, I'm going to the thrift store to see if I can find anything wish me luck I guess Okay, so that was just a no from me It was just not what I was looking for it. Wasn't like a stress store. It was more of a discount store. Yes There's a difference, so I guess discount stores is like stuff That's never been sold before it's just like discounted so everything was really cheap But it was just all new does that make sense like storrs is like used stuff. Which I like more I don't know. I just like it better. I was in there for a solid two seconds looked around walked out I was just yeah a role and no for me so yes, I think I'm gonna go home now or not go home And I'm gonna go back to the area that I live in because I don't live around here It's literally so foggy like it's just dead outside I decided I would just go home to eat Because every time I eat out like I love eating out and I love like getting fun foods at restaurants and stuff like that But like every time I do that I get a stomach ache just because I don't know eating out gives me a stomachache So I'm really not in a mood for that right now something to go home make myself food I literally haven't eaten for so long and I'm so hungry It's the only thing in my system right now is caffeine, and I'm like shaking shucks when I only drink coffee And I don't eat food like I freaked out a little bit not freaked out But like I forgot something to go home and I may eat And I'm gonna kind of like decompress a little bit calm down a little bit. I feel like I'm partially insane right now I'm like sweating. I don't know why maybe the heat is on in my car. No the heat is not on in my car I don't know why I'm sweating so much probably because I just consumed so much caffeine in my body is like Rejecting it in every way shape and form note to self and just some advice for you. Do not oh. God. Why you? Just don't drink coffee on an empty stomach like it's just not a good decision and every time I do it I regret it so don't do that unless you are okay with feeling like you're dying I actually kind of feel like I'm dying a little bit. Huh, are you? Kidding me this person is completely blocking my driveway. That's cool. That's totally dope I love that Whoever gave you permission To even go near my driveway. I don't know but now not only are you near my driveway, but you're also blocking it Not okay, okay, so update I ate some food Having a little bit of a panic attack because I had no food in my system whatsoever And I drank a double shot coffee instead of just one shot of Espresso There's two which basically means like double the amount of caffeine that I would usually have in a coffee So anyways um yeah for all the story was I was having no laughs freaked out, but for good now I have a bunch of laundry here some is dirty some is clean I basically need to sort it all put them away And puts them in the laundry hamper. I'm going on a trip in two days. I'm leaving in two days I'm going to maine I go every year. I've gone every year since I was like five. It's like a family vacation I don't even know how it's happened. I don't sorry I'm very excited but I have to assert like sort through all my laundry and then I have to pack which I'm gonna Pack tomorrow every bunch of Stuff to do and I'm leaving in two days, and I just have not prepared at all and this is like a 10-day trip So it's actually a pretty long trip and I just haven't prepared it. All my mom Just did my laundry which was amazing thank Bob That's like sort through it all decide what I would bring some you know have to figure out a way to Pack my camera in a way that will not like harm it, and I don't know how I'm gonna do that yet So actually when I'm done cleaning my entire room me and you are going to go to Best Buy Target I don't know something So we're going to get me a camera case so I can bring my camera with me on vacation So that I don't have to stop you tubing I can continue to YouTube while. I'm there so yeah, but for now I've to do this So I finished partially cleaning my room, but to be completely honest I got really bored, and I was like and I'll finish the rest of this later now I'm driving to Target because I need to get a case for my camera Which I needed to do anyway, so it's like you know whatever big whoop I don't know if you guys saw my last video which was my Vegan pizza video I'll leave a link in the description if you want to check it out when I was filming that video and while I was like taste testing the Pizza Well that was like two days ago, and my mouth is still burnt No, joke the roof of my mouth is like really badly burnt, and it really freaking hurt So note to self in the future just wait for the pizza to cool down before you eat It because I like regret it every time I'd burn the top of my mouth every single time so that's really irrelevant and no one Cares, but I just wanted to share my struggles with everybody I can't be the only freakin one that happens to me every time driving to Target I should probably go to like Best buy or something like that, but Target It's just way more fun, best buy gives me bad vibes, and it smells like burnt plastic in there for some reason I don't know why it just always smells like burnt plastic, and I'm not and of that smell I don't know if anybody is part of Aa vote This is not a target blogs or whatever okay bye-bye. Hell, yeah Who is ready to the most exhilarating exciting and fun Target hall? You've ever seen drum roll, please Let's get started so the first thing. I got is this overpriced camera bag this was like almost $30, and I literally feel like I get so Distant and I hope it keeps my camera safe because that's all I care about so yeah, I got this great fun awesome Dope next I got my mom something that she needed some Swiffer Swiffer jet wet mopping cloth. I hope this is the right kind if not, I will cry They literally have so many different kinds. I just picked the best-looking one. They all look the same, okay? I don't know and that was a that was it and I'm so sorry if you got excited that I like got anything interesting because I didn't but I was just really not in the mood To like walk around target like look at cute stuff like I was just... ew Honestly drinking that coffee earlier kind of got me messed up a little bit because it was just so much caffeine and they just like Freaked me out, so now I just feel weird stay later So I'm very very sad right now because I just received an extremely upsetting text I Have a week left until I get a new set of data If that makes any sense so that means for the next week, I can't use any data I don't know what I'm going to do. I might die. I'm not sure I'm very very upset this month I've just really been on that social media grind and it really is taking a toll. So I'm very very sad I'm just going to be on the constant search for Wi-Fi for the next week like if there is not Wi-Fi I won't be there. I think I'll be okay I am so pissed off right now I wanted a club soda guess what I don't have any at my freaking house That's an extreme inconvenience, and I'm not happy about it. Okay that pissed me off I was going to have a nice club soda and put some lime in it and it was going to be a grand old time Could you know what hmm? I used the last club soda yesterday. I am an actual imbecile I'm an idiot there will be no bubbles in my water, and I guess I'm just going to have to deal with it great I'm just pouring myself regular water. This is so awesome. It's no bubbles in it I love this so I'm just laying in bed watching The office per usual yeah, I'm just chilling you know I'm leaving on my trip like in two days and I just don't want to pack so I'm just going to watch the office for the rest of the night and do nothing so That was today's vlog I hope you enjoyed it if you did give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want I?

Today I'm going to be cooking vegan pizza because... You know what I don't need to give you an explanation, that's just what I'm doing and if you don't like it then you can leave. Just kidding, um, I hope you like this, let's do this. We're going to hang out together. Have a good time... Okay, so I'm going to be making. ow, ow I'll be making cheese pizza, now of course the first thing you need for cheese pizza is cheese. So I got this vegan cheese um I'm afraid of it. I'm not going to lie I am afraid it says that it melts and stretches, but for some reason I don't really believe that.., we'll see I'm a little bit stressed Whatever. Next, I got this tomato sauce, there's nothing really interesting about this so next I got this Paleo friendly gluten free grain free soy free non-Gmo, yeast free pizza crust. Why, you may ask because Unnecessary diet restrictions are so fun. Actually is this even vegan? I don't know AHHH, Okay, so um I didn't really plan this out very well because this is actually not Vegan. I assumed that it was vegan because it was Paleo, gluten free, grain free, soy free Non-Gmo, and yeast free, but turns out It's not vegan because it eggs in it, so I really this f***** this up. It was an accident you know um this is no longer Vegan, but I uhhh, I really f***** this one up. But you know what, I don't don't care. I'm gonna make it anyways, we'll just act like there's no eggs in this and just continue on okay. Let's go. The first instruction is to just whip it out. I can't believe I did that like I literally went to the store and was like ""Ya, I'm just going to get vegan everything. Like you know, I had one job. My oven is preheated, but anyway, I had one job and that was to get vegan pizza crust. But this is not vegan like how dumb can I be I thought I couldn't get any worse That's okay Okay Okay, so we have our little buddy up here right now. You know he's--he's ready for some toppings there's always so many freaking tomatoes sauce options, and I just never That's a lot. Okay. That's a lot I Got a little bit too excited, but there's always so many tomato sauce options And I never know which ones good and I get a different one every time because I just don't know which ones I like I hope this one's good if not going to be really frickin pissed because this one was so expensive And I'm also even more mad because not only is this not vegan But it's nine dollars this crust was nine dollars I spent nine dollars on that because I thought it was going to be vegan and it wasn't but luckily it's Paleo friendly Gluten free, grain free, soy free, non-gmo, and yeast free so I mean I guess if it was vegan, too I would be asking for too much. So I guess that is a lot of sauce, but honestly I love sauce What can I say so far so good looking cute? And you know but this crust is like really hard I don't know not yummy and doughy or whatever Oh--They're really trying aren't they? Okay, Uh-huh they want it to smell like cheese. They really do I I don't know. I don't know about that It tastes like protein powder, okay. Uh well, It kind of looks like doll hair. EW,  oh God. It's kind of slimy when you touch it. It's like very moist MOIST Like there's a lot of moisture on it That's okay because if you want vegan pizza you have to like take a risk you know And this is just one of them even though I love mozzarella cheese, and this is just depressing because it's like just not the same. You know I mean What was I expecting so okay actually this is like done, so I'm gonna pop this in the oven and see what happens So let's do it Oven is set to 10 minutes and 450 degrees and now I just have to wait for it to be done. I'm very I don't know that well I'm excited about everything except for the cheese I just I don't know I have this weird feeling that it's not going to melt like properly, but I mean I'm just gonna have to go with it. You know. We'll see what happens. Hopefully it's good Maybe it'll surprise me and maybe it won't so I'll be back in a sec It's ready - oh God I can't get it out so this is The cheese looks like Alien vomit to be completely honest, but it's smells pretty good I guess um the cheese just doesn't look that great personally one of my favorite parts of pizza is the nice little The nice Little burnt cheese parts, and that's just really not happening here um when you touch it, uh-huh it Just kind of sinks. There's no you know. There's no. I'm going to cut into it and just we'll see what happens Do we have one of those spinny pizza cutter things? no, it's okay. I think a knife will do oh god, okay? Wow, look how cute she is Now I'm going to just try her out. See how she is first. I'll smell it Honestly, it smells pretty good It smells right like it doesn't smell like anything's going on here the pizza crust is a little bit floppy. And it's really hot so I'm really going to burn my mouth. It was at this moment Jackson knew he f***** up. Ah! okay. I need to wait for it to cool down first--actually I don't want to wait So tastes good but the texture of the cheese kind of reminds me of a wet sock or like a butterfly wing. I don't know just hat's just  what remind me of. ah The cheese, it's really throwing me off I think this would be better. If I didn't know how good regular pizza is because regular pizza is just too good This can't even compete. You know well. I tried best. I could do that basically my video today I hope you enjoyed if you did give this video thumbs up, subscribe to my channel, if you want can let me know down below What I should cook next cuz I don't know I love you all very much You're all very special and I appreciate all of you so much, and I will see you soon.

I'm disappointed in everybody as the human race Why? you may ask. As a society I feel that we're neglecting something. Like I feel like there's something that we just don't give enough credit Everybody just looks past this place, and just doesn't even like give it the time of day. No one goes in there Do you know what I mean? That place is the dollar store you know you've probably been in there like once or twice for something like I don't even know what would you even go into the Dollar Store for like tissues decorations for your seventh birthday party I don't know the last time that I was in a dollar store was like seven years ago And do you know what I'm disappointed in myself I just completely looked past this beautiful store for seven years and just never went in again Why? I don't know. it's so great like I just like the stuff that I got you're going to be un- you're going to be Your mind is going to be blown I got like something like 12 things guess how much money I paid $12 because like each thing is a dollar you know makes sense right? I went in there had the time of my life customer service was impeccable I'm just not going to talk anymore I'm just going to show you and hopefully this will inspire you to take a trip to the dollar store So that you can change your own life and really give it the credit it deserves So let's get into this. So, the first thing I got was like one of the first things I saw when I walked in so I got this ninja hero set and you might be like Emma you know why would you purchase that? Do you really want to know why purchased this? Are you still confused? if you're still confused as to why I bought this why are you here? This is the coolest thing I've ever bought in my life How much do they pay for this one dollar I don't even know what else to say like honestly this is enough If you're not already in the car driving to the dollar store after seeing this I dunno I'm confused and I'm disappointed just in case you're still here And you're not convinced yet that the dollar store is the best thing in the entire universe I guess I will continue. So the next thing I got is basically a household necessity What's one of the best things that you keep in your bathroom? I don't know about you, but I'd say q-tips now This is a handy thing look at all these freaking q-tips all for one dollar that's great and all. No, it gets better. This is frozen q-tips Are you kidding me what more could you ask for in a product like? Wait a minute the Frozen part is removable, so Don't do that at home to keep it on speed as the frozen part is what makes it good Everybody loves frozen I've never even watched the movie, but... so I'm kind of a fake fan But we'll continue on. We'll just act like that never happened because I you know I never Never even seen the movie. I don't know okay the next thing I got is a completely crucial item that I just really needed and it was a light bulb Okay, this isn't a part of this I just needed a light bulb so after shopping in there for you know a solid hour and a half I got a little bit hungry, so I decided I'd get myself a snack and what better food than dollar store food, okay? these candies Are you kidding hard candy assorted fruit flavors. Look at these! These are like the funnest candies I think I've ever seen you know like Skittles, Starbursts, Jolly ranchers. They're they're fine They're good. But this, this looks good. The brand is Coastal Bay confections I've never heard of it, but I don't care. The options are endless. Oh, God. Oh! mMm Oh, yeah, that is so good. That one is cherry flavored, and it did not at all taste like medicine. That was really good Dollar Store candy thumbs up from me. Huh the next thing I got is bringing me back every sort of memory I could ever even imagine A freaking recorder. If you didn't play these in elementary school. I'm so sorry your elementary school must have been horrible. Oh, that sounds good That was so beautiful. Oh my God. I'm tearing up Some things never change. I am still really good at this The next thing might just have to be the best thing I got keep in mind. This was $1.00 Unbelievable Fashion scarf okay, but you haven't even seen the best of it, okay Are you freaking ready for this? As you can see it's this beautiful fashion scarf have some nice colors You know you see the blue you see the green It's great as you can see there's some little plants on it But what you can't see is the fact that it says herbed names under each plant for example This one says basil underneath this one says lavender underneath this one this rosemary underneath this one says Parsley underneath this one this sage underneath yeah I learned more about herbs from this scarf than I ever have in my entire life Which is what you think it couldn't get any better. It's freaking cute, coachella, whoo I will literally wear this to everything for the rest of my life. It could be a scarf on a cold day You could hang this up somewhere as a decoration. You know maybe in your garden. I don't know suit yourself You know I mean You know a lot of people sometimes they have gardening books that like kind of describes each like plant and like what it looks like Ya know throw them all in the trash because this this can provide you with all the information you need about every herb ever you're Welcome. I don't even know what else to say about this. This is just perfect this has no flaws I'm absolutely in love with it, and you should be too next I got something that I think is Extremely relevant to the times right now a lot of people have been getting hair extensions and stuff like that And I think it's really cool. You know like sometimes they can be like different colors and stuff like that Yeah, but they're really expensive if you know anything about hair extensions They're really expensive I went to the dollar store, and they hook me up you think that they don't have it all they have it all Hello, I mean. Yes what the heck people are spending all this money on freaking hair extensions when they can literally go to the dollar store and get to this thing it has a Built-in Braid on the top that is so cute and you know it. God. I'm living for this wow Tell me you're not living for this like try to tell me that you don't think this looks good You can't could you'd be lying I never felt so good my God just never felt better in my life like this is perfect. This is just too great a Few logs ago I
Kind of did a little back-to-school rant about how baptist school videos shouldn't exist and that they're just completely rude and disrespectful to everybody I Don't want to think about the fact that I have to go back to school especially in july But while I was there I did find something that I am going to be using for back-to-school So I guess I'll show to you this may look like I don't know something that you would see at a rave It's so much more look at this let me just take it out of its packaging so that you can see it in its full Glory yes, my friend. It's a fluffy pen when I was in Middle school I would have literally done anything to have this high you know I didn't really go into the dollar store at the time So I obviously didn't have access to cool things like this, and if they have them at Target, they're usually like seven bucks and I'm not willing to do that, so This is awesome. Let's say you're trying to impress your crush at school There is no better way to do that than to whip out this bad boy and just start writing This will be your secret weapon as well as here This could be your lucky pen I bet I bet but if I took a test with this I would ace it every time because I've been so happy about this that there's no way that I wouldn't succeed Every time I use this pen thank you dollar store the next thing. I got is just a cute accessory It was speaking to me. I just had to get it Anybody who knows anything about me knows that I love sunglasses. I love all that kind of stuff They're a little bit small for my head. They might be for kids debatable I'm not sure but they were a dollar so who even cared that they're for kids. I'm a kid and these look awesome I don't think they'd be that good at keeping the sun out of your eyes But I don't even care that's not even the point sunglasses completely for accessorizing only the next thing I got was a little wine glass thing But obviously I don't drink wine so I don't know what I'm gonna use this for yet I might even put iced coffee in it I mean, it's a little bit small, but we'll see so here's the nice little wine glass I got this could be perfect for any occasion Bridesmaids gift birthday party handouts birthday get anything on it It says promoted to cougar. I think that basically just means that you're really cool. Yeah, she's cool as a cougar Yeah, no I don't really know so I love this because it should have a really inspirational Meaning just saying like you know you're promoted to you know you're just you're cool now because before you are cool but now you're Being promoted to a cougar and that is so inspirational to me and beautiful if you receive this don't even try to tell me that You wouldn't be honored the glass quality on this is absolutely Spotless and perfect the graphics on this don't feel like they're going to peel off any minute I mean they had a bunch of other nice little graphics glasses that you could purchase if you wanted But that one just really really hit home for me. Just really felt like that is a great mug That is a great glass. I'll probably just be keeping that for me Just because I think it will just remind me everyday to just keep working hard so that I can be promoted. You know The last thing I got with this 48 piece puzzle usually I only like to do 4 piece puzzles You know just like four pieces. It'll take me about an hour maybe 45 minutes if my brain is really working on the move but 48 pieces well this will probably take me at least a week to complete it by the brand Lisa Frank if you never have Lisa Frank products when you were like seven I don't know. I'm sorry because she was the shit and everything that she ever had was so cool colorful It's like you're freaking on acid when you look at this stuff I'm now I've never been on acid, but I mean like this is just frickin vibe I just need to tear into this puzzle right now. I can't even waste any time It's ages 6 and up, so I'm old enough by like 10 years so I don't think it'll be a problem. Oh That was my video today I Really really genuinely hope that you take a trip to the dollar store now because honestly I don't think it's possible to see that I Bought all of that for 12 dollars and not want to go out to the store and do that as well I mean like if that isn't the most quality haul you've ever seen then you're lying to yourself and Hop in the car Hop on the nearest plane and just find one because I can guarantee you won't regret it I appreciate every single last one of you and Like this video if you enjoyed it subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want. I'll see you next time peace out If you're still confused, and you're still acting why? Yeah, I guess this is like too funny for me to film like I can't even be serious okay, okay? That was actually really intense"

This morning, my friend Gillian who works at soul cycle. Yeah What kind of animal is that dog ah Invited me to a free class. Which is dope because soul cycle is so expensive Okay, are you vlogging? I'm vlogging. Oh my god. Oh my god. Everyone's gonna see me. Oh my God So how do you feel about the fact that Jake Paul got fired from his Disney channel show? im so excited We have soul cycle, soul cycle, soul cycle, wait Gillian, do you work at soul cycle? I don´t know Yeah, so she works a soul cycle. She's quite the enthusiast she's Gonna teach me the ropes I've only done one class before this Gillian was Gillian was definitely eating a croissant before this because there's croissant crumbs Did you eat a croissant? Yeah. You had a croissant? I Literally know her too well. It was  like a while ago, so that's pretty old. How old was it? Just finished out class how was it ladies? Yes, ok so right now. We're going to Phil's because you know I need a little pump up. But it was a good class. Class was so good All I could say is Everyone should quit cheer and  do soulcycle yeah, cuz we all did cheer together at um this place They called California all-stars, and it's very you know she still does it I? wait I feel like this is so weird because like I can't see myself. So I just like I´m  like looking at the ground You'll get used to it I sweat all the way through this shirt But now I have to wear it because like I don't want to be naked in public. It's a really hard. You could put this on if you want. show me. I will literally get my disgusting so yourself. Okay. Good idea its Philz coffee time, baby Yeah, yeah, soul cycle is so expensive. So next time I'm just going to do a little cycling class on these little bikes. Okay? Is it on yep? it's on so we talked to I'm talking about soul cycle again um yeah, so if you're in the can I say the area ,yeah, I I had told them that, okay cool so if you're in the bay area , I´m getting camera shy Hello, oh We're vlogging. I was second row Jillian was front row because she's a savage Yeah, if you've never done the cycling  class I´d say you should do it dude jillian is letting me wear her little Soulcycle thing whoa Ah finished Goodbye. It was good tasty food. It was a good time jillian. Thank you for plugging me with that free soul cycle ride So fun, you're the og. Love you very much, peace out What am I wearing to the store right now this? Slippers and socks and a very large sweatshirt, and it looks like I'm not wearing pants, but I just don't care Basically I have to go to the store right now because my like refrigerator doesn't like Automatically make ice so I have to like buy ice from the store and then put it in this Because I used to use like little ice trays you know, but that's a lot of work If anybody uses ice trays comment down below just kidding But actually ice trays are the most annoying thing in the entire universe We got the ice So I was trying to pour it into my little thing here and it got all over the counter because I´m an idiot I'm very disappointed in myself Just dropped into a store real quick because I needed to get stuff for a video coming up, and that's cool I kind of feel like I like have just been laying in bed all day it's like this is a constant a reoccurring issue in my vlogs is that I'm like having like a Crisis because I'm like shoot now. I need to do something cool So I'm kind of I'm a little bit at a loss here, and normally what I'll do is You know get coffee you guys know the drill but I already had coffees today and honestly it really should not have another one because usually if I like Go over Three caffeinated coffees I like really lose my shit like I like really freak out like I have like a Full-fledged panic attack because that's just way too much caffeine for my little system, but yeah I'm trying to figure out how to get out of this parking lot right now, and it's a little bit confusing But I don't know how to get out. Oh, I know to get out now, okay anyway I really enjoyed my soul cycle class this morning Actually, I already talked about that enough nobody cares, but it's like kind of an awkward time of the day It's like 4:10 right out and so it's like too early to like go to bed but But it's like too late to like try to like go and do something because it's like kind of like four o'clock You know it's kind of late in the day, okay So this long ends up being a little bit shorter than I originally anticipated Which is not at all a problem because I have this idea that to kind of fill up the blank space I would drive around and answer some of the questions that I didn't see when I was filming my last q&a which was a little bit ago I'll leave a link to it in the description if you want to watch the original q&a But I want to answer some of the questions that I didn't get to right now. There was like I don't know a solid 5 of them So I'll answer them now so the first question was would you rather be rich and unhappy or happy and not rich yeah? I think that's what it was 100,000 million bazillion Bazillion percent I would rather be happy and not rich because that is just I mean that's not even that's a no-brainer for me happiness is my number one priority in life and It should be for everybody money as you know as cliche as it is money cannot buy you happiness And it really it really doesn't so that is my opinion on that Okay, next question do you believe in ghosts and stuff like that ,with ghosts I don't really know like I'm kind of mixed like I have mixed emotions about ghosts Well personally I had like one occurrence where I kind of think I saw a ghost but to be completely honest I have no clue what it was because basicly what happened was I was sleeping on the couch on my couch Just like I fell asleep on the couch on accident I don't know why that's that's just not an important detail but whatever then I woke up a few hours later and when I open My eyes I felt like I could see somebody walking past the couch if that makes sense so random I think what happened was I was still partially dreaming when I woke up from the nap   so I think that that's what happened, so like I was partially like kind of hallucinating So that's why I saw a person walk by the couch that´s what I think happened , honestly beats me I have no clue what that was And I've had like weird other occurrences like hearing stuff and stuff like that but I've never really seen a ghost so I don't know how I feel about it because I'm the kind of person like When I see it I'll believe it sort of thing So you know what I'm not closed-minded to it? But I don't know if I necessarily believe in it at the moment because I haven't experienced it myself, okay? I kind of rambled on about that one. next, well there's one question. I'm pretty sure that how old are you I'm 16 Oh one of the questions was what is your favorite dog breed? So I don't really have a favorite dog breed to be exact, but I do like dogs. I tend to like smaller dogs I don't know. I really like terriers in general. I have two terriers right now They're terrier mutt mixes things and also they don't shed their hair doesn't like get anywhere. It's which is really nice I also like Italian Greyhounds mini ones. I think those are really cute I also like toy poodles but when they have a puppy cut so like I don't like when poodles have like a poodle cut because I think It's a little bit. Well. There's nothing wrong with it I just think it kind of looks a little bit funky toy poodles with a puppy cut is like the cutest thing I They're so cute. So the last question in my q&A is do you have any tips for being a new driver? Well? I'm also a new driver. So I mean you know technically I'm not really qualified to give advice, but I would say if I have any advice for anyone I think the most important like the best tip that I could give anybody is just to kind of be a little bit more careful than you think you need to be some people might not agree with me on this but Always go to speed limit even if everybody else around you is speeding I know I do that like you know even when I'm on the freeway if the speed limit is 65 And everybody else is going 80 Maybe 70 if I'm feeling a little bit rebellious But um just follow the rules be smart be wary Don't get distracted like try to keep your head in the game constantly always give people just a little bit more room than you think That they need likes I mean obviously don't like freaking create an issue because you're leaving so much space but when you're driving or whatever like leave a nice little space in between you and the car in front you just in case something crazy happens If there was like an accident in front of you You have a lot of time to stop you have a lot of time to anticipate it And it's a lot less stressful pretty sure that's all I have to say You guys like Q&A´s let me know that was it for today's vlog I hope you had fun hanging out with me today And if you did give this video thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want your guys's comments Honestly make my day every time I just I literally I live to read your guys comments They are the sweetest best things ever and you guys are so funny, and yeah, so that's it I hope you have an amazing day night afternoon brunch lunch, whatever and I'll see you next time  "

In this vlog my friends and I wake up AT THE CRACK OF DAWN to take pictures in San Francisco (the golden gate bridge to be exact), and they turned out amazing!!!!

It's quick Stop at the gas station um you know lily what just happened food everywhere now my hands Some people like the gasoline smell um I don't not like smell gasoline. Can't it make you high a little bit? Here 5:30 6:00 a.m.. School, cambridge All right, cool. We are freakin here filament. Where's your mother look at this, freakin view?

I post has to be a little bit of cleaning or else no being pledged Okay, I'm guessing okay So basically that view was a little bit less dope than the other view we think that the students Gonna be better It's the closer to the bridge. I would say lily just did a perfect parking job It was nice all the way to the left She left a lot of room for a you know options for activities like you can do it You could play a little game of foursquare right in that little area that there's left can't see anything yet, but this view wow Don't like walk a little bit. It's like tight Keep some spot where you can actually take pics and try that my legs are burning But you know what I will do anything for a good instagram anything for the gram. Yeah Yes Put this shit, okay? I don't know if you can see that like no joke looks like the sinking titanic And I'm like very worried for it like I hope that there's not people in that cuz it literally looks like it's sinking Do you don't have a you have to accept its lifestyle? Oh? My God speaking. Oh look at this. What did I do in my life to deserve this view right now? I'm just feeling extremely blessed blessed up We saw this boat like I actually be like it's sinking this boat right here It's like sinking lower and lower it like looks like it's like sinking and like dying. She's like my friend She's like a tear falling on. Why are you crying? Because you just are so excited. It takes me right now. That usually don't even know I'm so sad andy White shoes are dirty luckily these are right luckily luckily Luckily these are leather so I mean you know I'm just like brush them off just brush it off like I do with everything else in my life Staying it. I was trying to be like cute So I took some actual pictures for them which I never do because I love when people take pictures of me But now they're like behind this fence, and then finally get through it I'm not looking good for me. God. This dude. I believe in you come on believe in yourself First oh my God she's doing you for the vlog yeah, so that didn't work But all right we got to get from this location all the drawing Once you show My guy you love people's my whole entire heart lily if the photos aren't in my icloud inbox in literally five minutes You're screwed. You are fired. It's like 7:00 a.m.. I don't even know what to do with the rest of my day I feel like I've already done so much What oh shit I? Forgot my wallet literally. Thank you so much, holy crap two hours later. It is currently 10:30 2:00 in the morning, and I feel like I've done so much like I'm literally ready to like go to bed But I don't want to take a nap I've been watching some youtube videos. Which is always a good time I don't know. I'm doing today. My mom's taking the car for a little bit So I won't have the car until like 2:30, but I can wait that's okay with me So it's still super early in the day, and I just need something to like help me out I mean, I was up at 4 a.m.. This morning for my little Morning sunrise picture extravaganza oh God Extravaganza that is embarrassing, but anyways I need a little coffee to pick me up. Oh my God look how beautiful. This is ready. Oh Wow Much much needed to be completely honest I kind of feel like a zombie It's going to continue drinking my coffee here And just hope with the freaking best that I get a little bit more energy yeah peace out Um okay pizza fidget spinner that's completely out of control this whole fidgets bender thing. Okay. It was funny in the beginning, right? Yeah, sure. It was funny. It's getting out of control It's completely getting out of control like people don't even use fidget spinners anymore, and they're making this kind of pizza Sanjit spinner I mean like they were like a one-week thing and then people just stopped using them now They're making this huge deal about like trying to like you know try to be like creative with it But like fidget spinners are over people don't use those anymore You know what? I mean, it's just through the complete phase And it just annoys me when I see people out there trying to like make fidget spinning happen, but like it already happened You know let me know down below are fidget spinners over are they just beginning I think they're over I think everybody else knows that they're over I haven't seen somebody use a fidget center in months weeks years I mean that's being an old thing that is so 2017 it is still 2017 So a few hours It's now about 250 I'm waiting for my mom to get home so that she can give me the car because I share a car with my mom but Anyway today. I was on Youtube per usual Obviously, whatever so just like looking through my subscriptions And why it's like 50% of the videos in my subscription box right now back to school videos that is True right now. It is july 21st for me. I have a little bit less than a month until I start school Which is the worst thing I've ever heard in my life. I might actually cry It's just too soon and like I'm not I'm like Emotionally like no like it's like it emotionally like upsets me if I see one more back to school video I will lose it I do not accept back to school videos in my subscription box until august and even then it's painful honestly back school videos shouldn't freaking exist It's 4:45 right now. I just took about a 30 minute nap and it didn't do anything for me And I'm just exhausted like I'm dead. I'm like dead inside. I'm dead in all aspects of the word I have no energy whatsoever I think I've had two coffees today both were caffeinated nothing helps oh my God Wow, I really think that I need to get another coffee because I just cannot physically emotionally mentally Function right now at all. I don't know about you guys, but I have less than a month left this summer And I have like barely done any summer reading most people like stopped having summer reading in like Middle school But I still have it and I'm in high school. So maybe my school is just evil. I don't know yes I'm not too thrilled about that I just don't have any motivation or inspirations when it comes to summer friggin reading so yeah, don't want to do that But I'm a little bit stressed about it. Which is not cool. You need to find a parking spot Because it's coffee time and I'm not messing around like I'm excited about this right now. I don't even know what I'm talking about I'm so tired like I just don't even know what my brain is doing and or thing I don't even care anymore people see me blog because you know what like everybody's little freakin vlogs now, so get over it. Yeah So that's it. I'm going to try to find a parking spot, and I'll talk to you later peace out. Yo This is okay. You know when you're like traveling, and you've had like ten flights And you just at that point feel completely numb like you just feel nothing you don't feel tired. You don't feel awake You just feel nothing that's exactly how I feel right now. I don't know how this happened to me I mean, I get it like I woke up early, but like wow I feel like Jet-lagged literally I feel jet-lagged That's so weird because I didn't travel anywhere. I'm still at home. I got a little bit hyped up for my coffee It worked a little bit You know it did its job but I'm still freaking exhausted um and I've basically driven around my block twice because Every time that I drive past my driveway, it's being blocked by someone and it's like it's not like it's the same person Guys, I have good news. I am now driving into my driveway. Third try, best try, we made it in. That was actually probably one of the most annoying things has ever happened to me But I'm also really tired and like when I'm tired I'm grumpy so basically like watch out. I'm not really that bad, I just get a little bit passive-aggressive. I know everybody does that but I just wanted to point it out I don't know why, okay? I was listening to fifties music on the way home And I was just vibing tearing up was just so good. Do you ever just like tear up because music is so good You're just like holy f**k. This is so good. Well yeah that happened. Aaaughhh. What was that noise? I don't think I've ever made a noise like that in my entire life Aauauhgeghhehh. Okay, so you know how earlier I was talking about how I have to do summer reading? Well one of the books I have to read is grapes of wrath. I am officially 52 pages into this four hundred and fifty page book I have to finish reading it in like 25 days, so I mean I don't know if I can do it But, probably not. I'm going to try to read right now everybody pray for me Everybody really send me love right now, but you know what if I believe in myself, I can do anything. No, that was a cute little nice try but like no I'm literally I'm gonna Binge-watch like every single YouTuber in the entire universe Instead because that's a way better use of my time like I'd way rather just watch Youtube right now I'm just constantly watching YouTube instead of doing things that I really need to be doing. Give this video a thumbs up you do the same thing relatable That concludes today's vlog I hope you enjoyed if you did Give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want it's about 9:30 right now And I feel exhausted. I've been up for Not for like 22 hours actually probably discounted that around 20 hours ish, I've been up for like 20 hours okay, and um yeah I'm done. I don't want to be corny I just want to thank you all for just being you and being so dope and amazing and just Wowing me every day you never cease to amaze me"

**THIS VIDEO WAS NOT SPONSORED",2017-07-21T14:45:38Z,122291,3840590,4500,"okay, so i have been seeing this shirt on pinterest. I'll insert some pictures. so you've probaly seen this gucci shirt and i'm not somebody who really wears a lot of high end clothing you know im the kind of girl who goes to Forever 21, get something that looks expensive, and just like hope that i'm tricking everybody, Anyway, that's the kind of girl I am. i saw this shirt on pinterest and I feel like everyone has it. I thought it was kind of cool. I was like, you know what, everyone has it. You know it's a luxury brand, but it can't be more than like 50 bucks, right? I mean you can't just charge that much for a t-shirt. I don't know. i'm gonna look up how much the shirt is and maybe I'll buy it So this shirt umm... for a white t-shirt. This is Gucci on it four hundred and fifty dollars. Oh Okay, yeah, I'm not going to get this shirt, originally I was like you know, if it's 50 bucks sure I'll drop 50 bucks on a white t-shirt that says Gucci on it Just because like just because they want to look cool to you. They want to be Trendy. You know okay? Sure, you know. I'm willing to drop the big bucks to buy a cool sure sure but for 450 bucks No, would you want I'm not going to give up right now because I could just look at this price and be like Ice there's no way I could do this. I can't just buy a $450 shirt I'm not a celebrity and I'm not loaded so you know what I supposed to do just look at this and give up and just edit you know I Know I'm on you. You won't get the Gucci shirt, no I'm gonna Dig matters into my own Frickin hands, and I'm gonna get myself a gucci shirt. How am I gonna do it? I don't know Brb I'm back Let me show you what I got. It's time to do a little gucci haul. So first I got this plain white t-shirt This is Brighter brands, Gildan next I got some paint brushes and last but not least I got Fabric paint in the colors Crimson ganache that is classy metallic pure gold pure gold people I'm not skimping out I want a GucCi shirt And I'm going to get pure gold Frickin paint like what do you think in Shamrocks because I'm like Channeling my Irish roots Firm as you can see I did not go out and purchase an actual Gucci shirt, because well I have maybe 20 dollars in my bank account right now So that just wasn't going to work now that I have these beautiful materials I'm going to attempt to create my own Gucci shirt, and you know what I'm gonna wear this around Every single day of my entire life and people are screaming like oh my God like wow that's like really cool like where'd you get? It and I'll be like I got it from the Gucci store. You just kidding Huh, I don't really know how to do this But I'm just going to do it shout out to Michael's for making this happen make creativity happen Sadly This is not me being creative. This is just me being cheap We're going to see what we can do okay, so you got a nice little white tee going on here going to lay this out out oh Okay, the first step is to write the words Gucci on the front that's easy enough I mean like right Gucci big whoop with a pencil by the way I'm using a pencil because you know if I mess up then I can erase it even though I don't even think you can actually erase on a shirt, but I don't really even care okay I just finished drawing the g looks pretty good I'd show you guys, but you guys don't probably care about the pencil part so far this looks pretty real I say if I walked around right now and people would just be like oh, yeah It's just Gucci's new line like whatever Gucci if you're watching this video Please send me a real one just so that I can like compare you know just for like marketing purposes It doesn't make any sense, okay net okay now I have to draw the Gucci logo, and this is a little bit complicated But I think that we can make it work kind of a g, and then it's like achieve backwards, okay? We can make that work. I can make it work, okay? We're getting somewhere This is just the easy part. This is just sketching it out. You know This is the part anyone can do when it comes to the paint part that's when things are going to get Frickin intense Now that I'd find us Now that I finally finished my sketch I think it's time for me to start painting but this paint is like permanent when you will stain your clothes So I kind of need to protect my outfit because like you know, I'm wearing a very high-end outfit right now a hoodie and leggings, so I need to protect my outfit, so Let's get started I mean, I knew that I was trashed before but I'm really feeling it now I'm going to take my solid gold paint. This is actual gold trying to make an actual Gucci shirt So why would I get something that wasn't gold just paint alone with a hundred bucks? But it's still gonna be cheaper than the actual beauty sure is so like whatever. I'm just kidding This is not gold okay. Think guys that kind of money Are you kidding me? I knew screw the top off. I need this is oh You know when they like put a little plastic thing on top to like keep it all you know safe inside Oh, I forgot to take that off um Threw that out of the thought that was way too much, okay? I probably shouldn't be doing this right on top of the shirt I'm honestly I'm kind of an idiot, but just go with it, okay Okay, I'm gonna take this brush, and I'm just going to dip it in the gold And I'm just going to start painting. This is kind of like too light like I feel like this should be darker It's like the gold is like too light color. So maybe I should add some brown Do you know what? I'm Gonna add some brown oh? My God this trash bag is like. No joke inflating my heat, so I'm like sweating so much wow I am sweating okay Okay, this time. I'm actually taking the little thing off the top ah I hope this is non-toxic some of it on my mouth It doesn't say if it's non-toxic, and I just got some of it in my mouth So if I die, that's why I added a little bit of brown And I think that this might help it look a little bit more gucci You like because you know like there's always that look to like fake gold color it looks too yellow Gucci desires every they're Disrespected and angry at me right now for its even thinking that I could just use that kind of shade as goal So rude of me okay, not even gonna Lie Just like Loki looks really good and I'm like kind of scared because I hope duty doesn't try to like kill me for like stealing their brand because like I am Making their $400 shirt for like 20 bucks. Okay. I kind of messed this up. Okay. The sea is not going so good I just can't wait to wear this in public forever like every single day of my life to school to the store to bed like I just can't wait to wear this constantly and For people to just be like wow she is the most rich person. I've ever seen in my life You know she's the kind of girl that would drop that much money on a t-shirt. I love that girl You know one like on t-Shirts and stuff There's like that little like are in the corner that I don't even know what it means, okay? That didn't really works. We're looking freaking good. Okay. I'm not even kidding like no joke I don't know if they'll probably sue me, but you know I don't even care if they sue me I'm going to take it as flattery They're actually like nervous because I'm so good at this like you know that would be flattering It'd be like I'd be walking into jail, and I'd be like yo like Like I trolled Gucci. This is just my own form of art. You can't sue me. I'm going fun Don't sue a little girl for having freaking fun. I'm living for this bit books bomb next step outlining the Gucci logo Let's get into it, okay So far this isn't going so well because the g is a little bit sick So I'm supposed to be kind of sin And it's kind of a little bit bigger than I think it should be in it if it's a little bit unique to me then I don't like brag to people about how is nobody else has this you know. It's a limited edition. You can't find it online That's why it looks so different because like Gucci made it for me That's the tips if anybody ever tries to say that your clothes are fake to see like no I just got the most limited edition one that you could ever get so like good luck finding it buddy Because it doesn't exist. I mean because Because I was made for me one is they're little mini cheese They're supposed to be the same size But one is a little bit bigger than the other but I don't even care because do you know what everybody makes mistakes And there's no going back now, so there's nothing I can do about it. Yeah this logo is not the cutest. It's definitely struggling I'm not going to lie to you right now It is struggling after seeing that I'm a little bit worried But you know what you just can't give up And you just have to keep going I have to add the lines on the side you get it that's easy enough we go oh ah I keep getting some of it in my mouth, but I forget I doesn't even face in on topic So like I could be dying from this right now now all I have to do is draw a line I think I can do this Okay, I think that I definitely center this properly It's definitely a little bit shifted over to the side But whatever you know what if you are going to notice and stuff like that They're going to notice quality paint job and everything else about it. That's so perfect and flawless last paint color of the day Okay, I'm going to try to take this off without using my mouth this time because I really don't want to get any more paint Into my mouth because you know what like I don't want to die. You know, but it's hard to get it off without your teeth shoot There we go when in doubt stab it with scissors Don't do that actually perfect wait Why does this like an all of that bad like I'm low-key impressed as myself right now Be this kind of looks like it's kind of good like it doesn't look real but like maybe this should be a new thing for people like me who just Can't drop that much money on a gucCi shirt. Just freaking diy it I think that the future diy people at some point people just aren't even going to buy clothes anymore They're just going to freaking diys everything all the times because not only is it freaking fun But it's fricking cheap didn't want I said make my own Gucci shirt I wanted to be able to buy my own busy shirt But now I'm starting to realize that you know what this is actually waste Frickin better and this looks awesome This is like too. Spot-on. I'm actually concerned as to how good this looks, but I'm also excited. So there's that - hey Oh my God. I'm talking to the camera you hear the anatomy I Literally thought you're go get out the last detail just add a little bit of gold at the end Why is why does this look so good? I'm like genuinely weirded out right now. Oh my God what the heck? I don't even know this do with myself right now. Okay. Here's the final shirt. I mean come on Okay, yeah like this side is a little bit shorter than this side the proportions are really done that well But I mean I even have like the little the little are right here. You feel like I did a little rei Wow Yes, yes, when the universe shoots you down And you're just like what the heck you forget to take a deep breath and you go to the craft store? And you just do it You know what a great feeling because this shirt now Very personal meaning to me these you know what I made it not somebody in a factory somewhere I made this so it means so much more to me and if people come in. They're like What is she doing wearing a freaking painted Gucci shirt, and then I would respond What are you doing with your real Gucci shirt like what are you doing with it? It's cute and I'm jealous that would be nice. This is way cooler No one else has a shirt that you may doubt it. Do you think anybody else has a shirt no? It's impossible You can't have a shirt. Sorry buddy. I made it this is limited edition, and I love it So don't hate on me actually you can hate on me you walk Because haters are my motivators and honestly if you're at home, and you want to make this fricking shirt? Do it anybody who hates on you about your Frickin Gucci shirt? They're lost and also I'd rather spend $450 on something like iced coffees. That's a way better use of that money $450, okay? I could get 100 iced almond milk latte a hundred for the amount of that shirt a hundred iced almond milk lattes Do you know how much joy that would bring me in my life a lot that solves all my problems look at it It has frickin personality It's a little bit wonky, but like it has personality and it has a soul, and it was created by yours truly So that just makes it 10 times freaking dope er. You know what I mean wow Thank you so much for watching this video If you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want. I love you I appreciate you, and I will see you next time you"

really this legal blog so I don't have to be a profesh but it's like 5:30 p.m. right now and I'm just like I would just I worked out early in the morning and then I just came home and did nothing so I'm like I really needed freaking do something with myself I don't know I felt like I didn't really do anything today so I had the bright idea I was like well let me just ask my mom what I should do of course she had a bunch of ideas all of which were extremely mom like do you know anything like no only a mom would tell you to do the stuff that she told me to do I don't know if I made any sense basically she told me I should get the car washed she gave me a few other ideas but I didn't really want to do any of those oh thank you thank you anyway my mom had this bright idea she's like oh you're bored with your day you don't you haven't done anything really today okay I have an idea get the car washed and at first I was like I don't really want to do that mom and then she was like oh well now you have two am I excited about it no I don't want to do this at all because the place that I go to to get my car wash is like the kind of place where you actually they clean the inside of the car to let me actually get out of the car and like wait for them to like be done and like I really don't want to do that but now my car is going to be clean so I just parked for a second so that I could actually like move everything in my car into the trunk before I got there anyway but while I was doing that I realized that I had a piece of dust on my nose the whole entire time so that's embarrassing [Music] they did that so fast no joke in and out in like 10 minutes I'll just show you how she looks now she looks great into the poor shiny ass I mean yes these seats are also like they're like kind of like a shut up shut up are you [ __ ] kidding there we go okay so the seeker like so light that they get dirty really easily we have dogs but they did a pretty good job it looks pretty clean the rest of the car looks great let's look at outside if she looks beautiful shiny in New Vegas 2017 car even though she's 2015 yeah so Scott the car clean and now I want to do something else but like I've nothing to do like I just like I don't have anything I need to do so I just don't know maybe I'll go to Target cuz like one in doubt go to Target but I think I recently wants to get into vlog and I just don't need anything from there right now so I don't know what I'm going to do I'm just going to sit here and brainstorm for solid like 20 minutes I would get coffee but it's like 6:00 p.m. so like I don't want to be all jazzed up for the rest of the day and then I did decaf but there's no fun in decaf so I'm really torn but I need to do I expect like hour on my blinker has been on for that whole time okay anyway I'm gonna just sit here like this for the next like 20 minutes and figure out what I want to do with myself and then we'll do something fun together so stay tuned they even start the car okay it's trying to drive the car before I started it that's not going to work pay him to pull the side of the road again so I can fix the freaking camera because vlogging is life okay I literally sat there for 20 minutes and did nothing sat there and just stared just stared out the window and was like what am I going to do because normally I like plan out my day but today I was like I don't need to do anything I've been you know doing stuff all the time like you can just take a day off but I can't like I cannot sit at home like I just I have to do something right now I'm just like driving in the back roads I don't even know where the heck but I don't have to do because it's like not really hungry I mean I'm kind of hungry but like and so I really want to go get food so I'm just like honestly I'm at a loss I've gotten a few requests to do daily vlogging and I just don't know how people do it because sometimes I just don't do anything and like so I don't know how people do dope stuff every single day when they daily vlog I don't know if you daily vlog props to you I can make a video every day maybe but vlogging every day that's just hard like I don't know how that's even I don't know how people freakin do it also I know I was like posting every day this is kind of random and no one cares but I know it was kind of posting every day for a while there but I think I want him to do it for the rest of summer every other day so um my new slogan I just came up with it super duper unique and no one's ever done anything like it my new slogan for my channel is at least for the rest of the summer are you ready for this it's every other day bro because see I want to post every other day why not just say it's every other day bro and be trendy with the time there's nothing wrong with being trendy okay it's not my freakin fault when I figure out where I'm going I'll let you know but for now I'm just going to drive around until I figure it out alright so I've just decided that I'm gonna go get food I don't even feel like I'm really not hungry what else what better do I have to do oh my god [Music] an accident almost just occurs right in front of me but your girls slammed on her foot that was the Sun crazy that's ever happened to me okay oh my okay that was like really scary I'm looking at cried you that was so scary okay so I'm looking back in that entire clip with blurry which freakin sucks but I'll explain what happened the two cars in front of me like basically almost collided and they were like swerving out of the way and stuff I don't even know it was crazy I don't even know what can happen but you can kind of hear the cars skidding in front of me luckily it had nothing to do with me so I was just chilling and thank God that I was on my a-game because I like easily could have jammed into both of them because they were the two cars in front of me and they just freakin went crazy because they like stops abruptly I could easily hit both of them but I slammed on my brakes we're chilling where I'm safe I think I mean they're obviously safe because they nobody knows nothing actually happened but it was pretty intense but yeah now I'm gonna get food and I can't believe that I kind of like got that on camera I didn't get actually what was happening on camera but I was like filming myself pretty unreal I wish that it didn't have to be a blurry clip though because that sucks but yeah whatever as you can see them back in the car and I have some bad news my bad news is that as you can see I went to the pokey place or pokey I don't even know how to say I do the tion to the pokey place and I'm extremely upset in devastated to tell you that well okay so at that place I don't actually get like a pokeball or whatever okay I know I'm not pronouncing that correctly but just don't come at me okay I'm just a little girl I don't know what I'm saying I like to get the hand rolls from that place you know it's like a bigger sushi roll and you eat it with your hands which is just dumb but whatever anyway so I went in there and asked for my hand rolls and they were like of course no problem that is totally cool yes I will get we will give you that and more of course it was like dope thanks dudes like great this is freaking awesome so I'm like excited I'm waiting and time passes and it's been like 15 minutes and I'm like what the hell where the hell is my friggin camera roll and then the guy comes up means that we ran out of the seaweed sheets you know like the seaweed like sheets that they used to like roll it in so I just waited there for like 20 minutes and they forget ran out of sushi sheets and I don't even like they had one job I don't understand how you run out of the sushi sheet like no one even gets that stuff like that I'm like the only one in the entire universe who actually gets that like actually order of andrel everybody else freakin gets like I don't know a bowl so basically I thought that I was cool and I thought I was done but now I'm actually getting hangry normally I wouldn't get angry with only this when I'm hangry now so like I need to figure this out ASAP so I don't know where to go but I need to figure it out because this is getting a little bit intense but we're working with it and just taking deep breaths because you know what everything happens for a reason maybe this is going to lead me to a yummy R food that I never even knew existed I might even get Asian box which if you don't watch my other videos I really love Asian boxes this restaurant and it's freaking really tasty so maybe I'll get that instead and maybe everything will be okay and after that I want to get why is the cart making that noise anyway and then after that I want to get so coffee if they're going to still be freaking open because I've just wasted 20 minutes of my precious precious time trying to forget wait for my hand rolls there weren't even be made sorry I'm a little bit pissed off but I think I'm a good Asian box and I think everything's going to be okay I think I don't know I'll let you know freaking hungry though I'm hangry like I'm extremely hungry and it's kind of getting to me it's kind of making me a little bit it's not me I'm not myself you know I'm not myself when I'm hangry after I get my food all in this world will be well again and I'm excited and I'm thrilled and I'm just I'm ecstatic we'll see what happens really fricken wanted that hand roll I was just it was gay my mouth was watering for it like I was so excited that's fine no big deal it's not even a big deal not even a problem totally cool I am totally okay right now so I got Asian box I'm pretty excited about it to be completely honest I'd talk more about it but I'm so hangry right now that I just need to eat this I'm eating in the car because I'm just weird and then I'm going to see if I can negative fill coffee before it closes and if not then I'm gonna have to find another place and that's going to be really stressful so I hope that I can eat this really fast and honestly if I don't end up making it to Phil I'm blaming it 100% on the pokey place because they just really they just really screwed me up okay update I had to like map it to get to the cafe I wanted to go to originally I wanted to go to Phil's coffee because I just wanted to but they closed at 8:00 and what time is it right now it's eight o'clock so that wasn't going to work I yelped coffee places open late and I found one place that's open till 11:00 and I looked at the reviews and it said that they have homemade almond milk homemade almond milk so I'm pretty excited about that probably gonna get a decaf iced almond milk latte yeah we'll see it took me no joke 20 minutes to find parking more on the story is I am here and I'm gonna go get a coffee now decaf because I need to sleep tonight it's like 8 o'clock but yeah I hope it's good because I really wanted Phil's coffee but you know what sometimes got to do what you have to do because you know it's like maybe this could be a way that I'm discovering a new coffee place I'm going to just cross my fingers that it's good the reviews were very mixed actually one of the reviews that was talking about the homemade almond milk was like I was extremely angry because I wanted soy milk and only things they have is homemade almond milk and I was extremely upset okay like whatever but I like homemade almond milk so we'll see I'll be the judge I bet it'll be good let's go okay so for anybody who's wondering is this coffee it was okay I mean it was super expensive and the homemade almond milk was kind of disappointing because it's super sweet and I don't really like what my almond milk is way too sweet kind of pisses me off I mean what can you do feeling very full but I'm feeling happier now earlier I was a little bit hangry but we're good now we're good now and this was okay I hope it's decaf because like I always worry when I get a coffee at night I'm like what if they forgot to make it decaf I'm screwed like I am screwed but I'm not feeling a kick I still feel tired I think we're good it was a fun experience and the people in there all have Italian accents don't ask me why all of them have Italian accents and it made me feel like I was in Europe so I was like do you know what this is okay yeah I guess I was today's vlog if you enjoyed this video and you enjoy blogs give this video thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want you're just awesome

Check out his channel!!  https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-07-17T15:12:48Z,41030,917288,858,"I'm suhh (emma doesnt make sense here) Gone out okay. Oh wow hello guys. I am so excited for this video right now I can barely contain myself. So let me tell you what I'm doing today. I'm making something great You know on pinterest you see all those people with those little like succulent mini little succulent gardens and stuff like that Okay, succulents are like just I don't know there's a great plant like they're so cute everybody loves them And it's like I have to say his words I don't say this word, but I'm going to have to say this word, but they match my aesthetic aesthetic Yes, I said it, and you know what today. I'm going to make my own diy Trendy Pinterest af goal succulent mini Garden things, okay So today I spent about an hour and a half and home Depot trying to find everything because that place is huge Are you kidding me? This is like something that actually could really up my game It could really make my room cooler more Trendy more pinterest You know just everything I want to be in life the first thing I needed to find with cactus soil and like at Home Depot There's like 15 different kinds no more There's like 40 Different kinds of soil and half of the bags are like bigger than me like you like the bags are like no joke of soil, they're like my size, so I Can carry that and I also don't need that much I finally found this I was extremely excited about this soil because on the front it says *GREAT FOR SUCCULENTS* What am I doing today? making a succulent gardens! This is this just made me happy okay? I was happy because I found it next thing I have to buy was sand thats pretty self explanatory But whatever that also took me like 30 minutes to find and then because I'm really extra like extremely (when get it emma ur extra shut up) Unnecessarily just over the top with everything I do in my life I thought it'd be a good idea to buy some accessories like for my little things like you know, okay? Buy stuff like succulents and dirt in sand that's cute, but like being there needs to be more you know like I need to like decorate it, so I bought some moss. I don't know if that's going to be cool. Oh my God. It's leaking all over (ur a mess emma) Okay, um but I bought moss just so I could like kind of decorate it It look like a real like a real life wild succulent garden That was just created by mother nature herself, but in this case mother nature's me (ya right loser) so I feel like fine mom I don't know it whatever the last little accessory. I have is oh My God, they're so hot because they've been sitting outside. (why did u leave the stones outside??) Okay. I have these stones If this succulent garden isn't perfect after all these things I don't know it I'm hoping that this turned out well this turns out. This is kind of like trial and error I'm not teaching you how to do this because I don't even know what I'm doing So like we're going to do this together, and if it turns out good try it out And if it turns out bad, then im honestly going to be so upset if this doesn't turn out well So I'm gonna do everything in my power to make it turn out PERFECT Let's get started what I have here is this little thing it is extremely overpriced from Target I'm still kind of mad that I paid like eight dollars for this oh God it smells horrible. (why did u smell it dumba$$) Oh, we don't still fill it with sand first that could've been bad I almost filled it up with soil first, and I'm not supposed to do that whoa This is so mesmerizing God this thing forever should I put more I don't know yeah. No, I think that's fine, okay I'm already proud of this like it already looks great I'm just hoping that it things don't go downhill from here next we have to add the dirt, and I'm like inside right now But I like brought the dirt inside. We just like no joke so hot out (ya u live in cali of course its going to be hot) that I literally cannot sit outside. So if I get dirt all over my living room. Sorry mom. Oh, no. It's already getting everywhere It's looking so good okay, okay? I can't mess this up now. I can't mess it up. I'm too far in No, I have dirt all over my leg, okay now (bitch where?) This is when things get fun, but also kind of stressful because I have all these different choices And I just don't know how I want to do it. Let's start out with this little buddy. How the hell do I oh oh? Okay, guess. I'll just place them in there, okay There's I feel lost in the sauce right now. Oh, I keep hitting my knee Think I'm just gonna have to get down and dirty and just put my hands in here That's okay with me could you have to do what you have to do to be freaking aesthetic goals alright? You can't it doesn't come it doesn't come cheap look like I'm making a huge mess. So that's kind of not cool, but whatever Okay, that looks friggin cute so far, and I'm totally digging it So I'm feeling like I have these like two Main statement succulents, but I need to add like a little mini one a little mini one right right here. aww He's just sitting there. I feel like this one I put enough succulents in it And I think what I need to do now is I need to do the decorating if you put too many Succulents in it then it just like it's too clogged up, you know SOOOOO let's start accessorizing now This is the fun part I guess or is it. I don't know. I think this is all pretty fun So taking my sheet moss. I didn't even know that this was a thing but (sheet moss is a thing idiot) Okay, oh My God wow look at that that is so freaking cute I'm not going to put too much though because then it'll look like somebody like vomited in my little thing you're at home right now And you really want to do this go spend like four and a half hours at Home Depot and just do it man (cue shia labeouf) Just through it now. I'm going to add some stones. I Left these outside in the sun on accident, and they're literally so hot that I can't even out They're so hot I can't even hold them this one looks cute I guess I can't tell if the stones are like tacky or not this one's cool. Oh, okay? I'll do one more a little bit, and I don't know how I feel about the stones Maybe I'll just put two because if I put too many Then it will think I'm trying too hard and as I said earlier I want this to look like mother nature herself made this like it's just straight from the wild Nobody no human has ever touched it. It's just completely on its own. You know I want to make it look natural. Oh my God. This is beautiful : ] Don't know if you can see that, but it's done, but like I'm not satisfied with this one I want to make more so Brb while I go look around my house for a little glass things that I could use to make More of these because I feel like one It's just not enough give this a you a thumbs up if you agree one succulent Garden is not enough food I thought I made a mess also if you're doing this at home I would recommend not doing this inside because I have dirt all over the ground yeah I'm gonna do another one now though, because I feel like I should (emma gets hurt) I'm so excited right now because ow (how many ow does emma say in this video, comment below) Because I just found two more things that would be perfect for my frickin succulent Let's just fricking it up, and you know what I'm feeling really #blessed right OW. I have a splinter from something *GASP* Sorry, I said to like get out my splinters. OW Oh my God splinters all over me. What now. I'm gonna. Do these - This is like surprisingly easy like I wanted this to be harder use any of you like more entertaining, but you know I'm just going with a freaking flow right now I don't know which ones to use like the options are so endless, but I do love this one They're so cute like it's cute little bubbly bubbly things (are you a child?) Whoo okay, okay, okay? Okay? I can't mess this up. What's next uh-oh Now things are turning this is oh sue, okay, Emma don't give up this is not It's not over okay, and I don't like that, okay This one's not looking as cute as the last one I'm a little bit mad when one is looking bad you just try again my favorite part is when I add the dirt in not really actually this is the worst part because I feel like I'm Making a huge frickin mess in my living room if this was outside on my deck (go outside idiot) I'd be like oh, that's like so cute You know like I'm just like I'm just like being a little diy kid just like no look what just happened. I broke her I'm a horrible person. OW I almost spilled dirt all over my frickin living room Talk about my mom being mad at me that would not be good I did break the last succulent, but I just added a new one and she looks awesome So I'm just going to try to act like that never happened because that will forever haunt me And I will forever feel like a murderer, but you know what what can you do if one succulent? Dies the next one you just give another one in life you know okay? That's how I'm gonna make myself feel better right now um, but I need to add another one But like none of these other ones look good I kind of want to add just one of these because like you see how there's like a bunch I want to add just one so I don't know if I can break this across I (you probably just killed him :( Guess I can't see I like that okay, wait do I though. I don't know know if she's falling over She's just freaking flopping everywhere like she doesn't know what she's doing get it together. Okay? This is my succulent gardens. I own you (""bitch""-succulents) I'm literally like sweating to freakin death right now. I'm starting to get a little bit stressed out because my work space here It's so messy, but there's nothing I can do this is a life of a diy queen I can't there's nothing I can do about it. I really am scared to my mom to come home She's Gonna Frickin scream at me and be like Emma what the hell your succulent garden is goals its goals But you just frickin made our whole entire living room mess, and I'll say mom the thing you don't understand that I'm trying to Frickin oh regrets oh my God (ur so stupid) There's like dirt inside of the succulent, and I wanted to like blow it out So that there was a dirt in it, but it went straight into my eyeball and that was just cute at all So please do not blow into your section when one adds dirt in it that is not a good idea (ya no shit sherlock) No, don't do that. You know it looks okay? I don't know if it's as good as the first one, but it's doing alright, and that's good enough for me guess What time it is okay? It's moss time this actually looks like real moss. Which is cool. Oh Okay, now it's rock time Okay, so now this rocks because it's like white and kind of marbley, and that's like cute right okay, okay? I don't know how I feel about the rock like you see it cuz like the rock is cute But it's just kind of random. It's just kind of like out of place. I feel like I like it without the rock Sorry rock you are out. No. Thank you (""bitch""-rock) I made frigging two and they both look bomb af but I don't want to stop because I have been so let's continue That's fine. You know what I think is outrageous if you go to Home Depot, you can buy these like pre-made for like $40 and I'm doing it, and I'm making like 20 of them. No, I'm not fit I'm making up crap cut of them for like not not $40. You know I mean succulents L like buying individual succulents are freaking expensive. I thought that I was going to be like you know banging out a budget I was like hell yeah each baby little succulent was like three dollars or something each like each little one You know and I'm just like just cool and all because I know succulents are the Trendy plant and I know that stores are probably Like yeah, let's charge extra for the succulents because everybody's picking off them I get it but at the same time It's not really fair for people like me We're trying to just diy and be like swagging on a budget if you're charging me three dollars per little freaking plant I Don't know just me not trying to be a succulent activists or anything like that, but just speaking my mind, okay This one is actually pretty cool And I'm digging it because like this little narrow thing like very Modern very Like you know like I feel like you'd see this on like a magazine or something This one. I think I want to add a rock to I just I I want to go out on a limb here, I Don't like the rocks (rocks have feelings emma) like I'm actually kind of pissed because I thought I was like so excited because I with I already have rocks At my house like I'm so excited because I can incorporate these rocks into my lifestyle I was just excited about it but I'm really feeling like for this activity the moss is really the best option for decorations like everything else is just Mediocre, but the off it's good ok I'm not even going to lie to you right now not trying to toot my own horn I'm you look freaking swag I'm pretty proud of them not even gonna lie to you right now except for the only hard part about this whole thing was going Shopping for all this stuff. It was it was hard. I'm not even going lie. I'm not going to sugar coat it There's so many freakin options and although people were judging me because they're like why is this 12  year old girl? I'm not 12 (ur literally 12) I'm 16 why is this 12 year old girl in Home Depot by herself like trying to carry a 10-pound bag of like soil, and it's like falling and tripping everywhere um why why is that happening? So I've just completed three and my mom just shot me a text Does anyone even say that shot me a text? (only u) My mom has sent me a text and said that she's at the store, and she found these cute little like Dolman things made out of glass so me. She's going to buy me one You'll see me with it in like five seconds because I'm gonna edit it really quickly And then it'll be like oh my God no time pass. Oh really time actually did pass three two one So now I'm done with all of mine. I actually ended up making five It's actually a lot so I'm going to show you them in depth. Just so you can see Okay, that was my video today I hope you enjoyed it if you did give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my Channel comment down below anything that you want I'd say overall this actually went really well And these are super cute so like if you want to do this you should obviously do it like I'm not even just saying that Like it was fun, and now I feel like my house is going to be like 10 times more Trendy. So that's always good You're awesome, and I'll see you next time bye rock hater :/"

guys..... 1,000 subscribers!!!! AHHHH THANK U THANK U THANK U THANK U IM SO EXCITED AND I LOVE U ALL",2017-07-15T17:08:46Z,22438,544767,892,ah QA number one hello guys it's Emma today I'm doing something I'm very excited about doing a QA I've always wanted to do QA like literally ever since I've been watching YouTube since like the Dark Ages ever since I started watching YouTube I've been like I want to do a QA like I don't know it just seems so fun today my wildest dreams are coming true and I am doing a QA first thing they put on chapstick though honestly I hate when people do a Q&A and answer like two questions and then they're like yes that was my Q&A like no I want to give you guys that fully loaded Q&A I'm gonna like do these every once in a while but every time I do it I'm gonna make it good if you left me a question thank you so friggin much I'm just gonna go let's just let's just do it let's do it first question of the day what do you use to edit I actually get to question a lot surprisingly I just use iMovie for like everything I just use iMovie I always use iMovie but to make like my little text like so sometimes all I do text like where's just text on the screen like if I ever need to do like graphics or anything like that I'll use the website canva so I use canva for my graphics and I use iMovie for all my editing 100% of my editing is done on iMovie what are your favorite songs at the moment so I need to go look at my Spotify right now because I don't know there's so many I can just add look two L's they do I like songs kinder blumen by real estate that's a really great one okay I like the whole entire Mac DeMarco album like he just came out with an album the album called this old dog basically every single song on that entire album is just so good so I'd say that OH another good one is quite some time by Nick Lang that's a good one definitely chant out those songs in the car gym after those songs in my room j-mac the songs constantly just constantly popping those should I like so many different songs that I likes it's like really hard for me to pinpoint one but I think that'll do for now who is your favorite artist um I'd say my dad is my favorite artist because he's my dad and he's also an artist he has a YouTube and an Instagram so if you want to check it out I'll leave his info in the description of this video and you can go check him out he's very talented so do that if you want you believe in horoscopes and natural signs bye wait love you chickie love you too so actually okay I never just got a story time okay I'm a Gemini by the way I think I'm very much my sign I'm actually I do genuinely match the traits very well before I used to think like horoscope but you know it's just like a basic like generic statement that could like match with anybody like I kind of thought it was a scam I kind of thought it would say guys I don't know a lot it I don't know enough about it to like say if I really believe in it but like I have to say I'm very much like a Gemini yeah I say I kind of believe in it I mean I don't know I I don't exactly understand it but all I know is that I'm Gemini ass and yeah who's your favorite youtuber okay right now I have three are no four I'll say that for right now one caffeine eyes that to co-teach oh he's hilarious three Tana mojo in four Dawn's wind I'll explain all them caves you guys that it's just a freaking genius okay he's just a genius Cody tell hilarious he's so freakin funny if you haven't seen his videos I would definitely recommend I like remember him from vine all of a sudden he like just like showed up again on on YouTube and I was like dude yes to love his videos Chinna Mojo's he's freaking hilarious and I don't know I just like like her she's just cool like I'd love like hang out her she was like a cool girl and then the Dolans winds are just beautiful anyway okay moving on what's your favorite movie flushed show um so my favorite show we probably ought to be the office I love that show it's just it's so relatable like I said oh I'm serious like it just in it clump they always makes me laugh like if I'm to something like kind of a rough day and I'm having like anxiety and I'm just like feeling all wound up and stressed i watch the office and I just like relax Dwight it's just like Mike I just don't know the characters are so well done like I just love that show and then favorite movie I have three I've mentioned this in another video I feel like before but whatever excite again number one Napoleon Dynamite your mom goes to college all-time favorite movie number two Coraline another all-time favorite movie literally love that movie like I saw so good but um in the number three moonrise kingdom super well done movie just like my aesthetic like it just aesthetic aesthetic aesthetic mmm Oh every time I say that word out loud I'm like embarrassed for myself because I'm like why are you it's just like it's such a what inspired you to start a YouTube channel this is definitely something that could have a long answer but I'll give a simple answer basically I've been watching YouTube for so long I've always been the kind of girl who liked liked YouTube over Netflix like I literally I used to watch friends if you know who Friday's like that wasn't like literally 2006 wait wasn't 2008 maybe I'm not anyway definitely long time ago I was watching YouTube since no joke like four years like almost 10 years probably and I just always loved it and I kind of like I want to do it like I made YouTube videos when I was like 10 then I deleted them all because like I think I got like one hate comment I was like oh this is too scary and deleting everything and I was also really young so I was like just didn't know what I was doing the quality was horrible I need to find those videos again if I can't use those would be hilarious to watch oh my god I don't even want to know so basically I've always loved YouTube and then I was just like and I tried to start like for the past year I just like wanted to do it and I said never dance and then one day I was just like it is this is one things we complicated but I won't get into it basically it was just like a bunch of things happen in my life I was like I just wanted to do something different so I looked you know I'm just freaking do it I'm going to try to make my dreams come true and I started my channel and ever since then it's been amazing and it's been probably one of the best decisions I've ever made and I'm like so happy about it like I love this like this is great okay that's kind of a long answer what do you used to film so if I'm filming vlogs I either use my iPhone or I use a Canon ELPH 360 we have another 360 Canon ELPH 190 but I don't really use that anymore I mostly just use my phone because this is the easiest and then as I'm filming like a regular video like this one right now I use my Canon EOS Rebel t2i I'm not I'm not very techy I think they have like this t7 eye or t8 I own now but the t2 I it's doing the job gets the job done what else can I ask for how's life going Sam that's a really nice question I say let's going freaking awesome it's summer for me right now I never want summer to end like no joke I'm having so much fun oh I just don't want a day like I can't go back to school like I'm going to be a junior next year and I'm just not pumped so trying to just like soak up every moment of this freaking summer so that's it life's going fan how do you come up with videos to make honestly this is like the most this final hard question for me to answer because it's so great I don't like I no joke I'm just like I'll get this idea or like I'll see somebody else do a video and I'm like oh I like how they did it I want to do my own way you know I mean so yeah it's like random but sometimes I'm just like who I want to vlog today or if I'm like no I'm gonna be doing something cool that day I'll be aquila I'll just log it it's honestly so random like there's no like I don't plan things very far in advance I'm just like yes this is what I'll do today any tips for being an upcoming youtuber well I have to say I wouldn't say them necessarily qualified to give you advice considering I'm also enough coming youtuber I'm a small youtuber like I've been doing this for like a month and a half ish so I don't have that much experience but I would say the only advice that I can tell you is just literally be yourself don't feel that you need to copy anybody to be successful on YouTube and anything it's the opposite people love to see new kind of fresh face like you know something new something different because if everything was the same people start getting bored about they want to see like change they want to see something different so I think my biggest advice would be just to try to find something that like you feel like you can really be creative with and just like go for it and just like be yourself and just have fun with it don't do it just being like I'm in care what happens I just want to have fun do it for you do because you think it's fun freakin do your best honestly just have fun with it I didn't even know if I answered the question but whatever what goals do you have for your YouTube channel I don't have goals for my channel but I'd say goals for me just like do my best like constantly be putting out stuff that I think is cool and like causally be like growing like I don't want to like stay in one spot like I want to grow like a big youtuber like no I'm not saying like numbers-wise I'm saying like I want to grow and become like a better youtuber terrific that's like just like be better overall and just have fun with it okay that's about answer okay next question is who is your favorite madcon member oh my God thank God you asked this question here's the deal so just cut this kind of complicated because it depends if you ask with 2013 wait one was this 2015 one Maxon was like really hot you know like the og man con my favorite was 100% nash grier 100% I liked him over Cameron dalas I lied Nash was my favorite but as time progressed I kind of I don't know is I switched over because then I started like hayes grier and i like hey is more than Nash but I still like Nash I like them now as I'm getting older I think I kind of forgot about Nash and haze and now I like Camryn I watched the show chasing Cameron on Netflix and that's a good show like I'm not even lying like I actually enjoyed it it was so entertaining just it's like matt khan but like now and like now i'm like kind of I'm not too old for Matt Khan but like that's not really my thing anymore because I definitely was in love with it when it first was a thing you know targeted girls my age so I was just all into it I loved it so continuing on how old are you I know such a basic questions that's gonna be the question people bro you're wondering I am 16 years old and my birthday is May 22nd 2001 okay next do you have any tips on how to maintain an Instagram feed so I should make a video about their sleep in the beginning of my channel and it was like kind of I don't know I didn't like it like it was good but it wasn't great so like I ended up making it private if you guys want to see it I guess I can make it not private anymore if you want to see it but I'll give you the basic lowdown right now basically my biggest advice is to use the same filter for all of your photos that's important and also just like trying to like vary your content overall like don't post all the same like don't only post selfies you know if you want like a really aesthetically pleasing feed be posting like you know like put a picture of like a plant and then post a picture of you and as let's picture those in and then both picture of a copy and then post picture like kind of vary it just like have fun with it and like make it like unique and kind of like you know colorful and balanced and I don't know kind of like one of those things use it to play with it and just like if you think it looks good it looks good like trust your gut and just like that's what I have to say so awesome couple to do PDA so I'm assuming that's public display of affection or whatever I think right well that's like cute and all you know when people are just kissing on each other and public whatever I'm like walking down the street and I'm just like okay honestly like I guess it's silence free country do whatever you want to do but at the same time I mean like I can't relate to them like what I'm watching them like oh that's cute so I can't relate so like I'm just like kind of salty but like whatever you know I would say I doesn't like bother me he doesn't like make me uncomfortable but it pisses me off because I'm so single okay on my last question of the qat can you do a makeup video so I suck at makeup like I'm not wearing makeup now I literally I wear makeup only to like take pictures and that's like it but I mean you guys want to make a video like on like my everyday makeup routine it's not like very advanced like it's pretty um it's pretty like basic so it's not like you know I'm doing all this technical stuff but honestly if you guys want to see it I'll totally do it every time I go to makeup I do it exactly the same so if you guys want to see it um I mean this girl wants it so honestly I'll do it for you girl I'll do it so I'll probably end up doing that at some point in the near future that was my QA my first one definitely not my last I love Q aids I don't know why they're so fun for me I hope you enjoyed if you did give this video a big thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want give me video requests if you want I mean I always like to hear what you guys want to

THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR 800 SUBS!! ITS SO UNREAL AND I AM ETERNALLY GRATEFUL",2017-07-14T15:56:12Z,35317,1152703,628,all right welcome to vlog number 14 I think 13 14 14 whatever okay so right now I'm driving to my grandparents house because I got my first job job basically my grandpa's paying me to go through his garage and like organize all of okay I need to give a little backstory so basically my grandpa's an electrician and he was explaining to me that basically what happens is after he finishes a job like at a house or whatever or whatever he's doing whenever he's finished with a job he has a bunch of spare parts left over from the job that like was partially used or kind of used or they just have leftovers or whatever so they just throw all that stuff into a box and then he throws that box into his garage and then now he just has a bunch of boxes that has spare parts in it like in his garage and he wants somebody to sort them so that they can be used again because some of them are me aren't even used so my job is to go through all those and sort everything into little piles like I have to like separate everything and there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of it what we do I go I go this way there's hundreds of different types of parts I have to go through all of them and I have to like figure out what's the same and like group it all the other and it it's take it's gonna take a long time Oh God like I already did this for one day earlier in the week and it was freaking exhausting so I'm not too pumped but you know what you gotta do what you gotta do to make that money it's alright I'm always so afraid of these things cuz I feel like they're not gonna like stay and it's just gonna fall down and chop off my head we'll see so if you want to know I have to organize all of this this these this and last but not least this huge bin filled to the top with freaking random stuff like what even is this I have no clue what is this I don't know what is this I don't freaking know but yeah I have to organize all of that so that's cute right so freaking cute and I'm so excited yeah I guess let's get started honestly I'm probably gonna work until about it's like 10:00 now so I'll probably work until about 2:00 but luckily cuz I'm working for my grandparents so they make me food so that's kind of nice but besides that wow I just hit my tailbone okay anyway like it started with that right now um but on the bright side there's this cat and then he keeps me company a little bit is he trying to bite me I don't even know these are all my favorite toys haha okay let's get started it's for this one kind of thing there's like ten different sizes and I have to like figure it all out and just socks but you know what that's okay and my hands are really dirty but you know what we're having fun we're having fun my brain is like going to explode but you know what it's okay because you have to do should go to do for that money just kidding that's joke that's not let's get back to work so my grandma just made me some lunch which was really good and just so cute of her to make me lunch it was great so yeah I ate that was really good she made me a nice little veggie sandwich it was good ten out of ten would recommend and now I'm just I'm freaking done like I I can't do this anymore I'm done for the day I'm taking a spinning basically I did like all this stuff and then I also did like all of this so I'm honestly I'm gonna call it a day right now and I'm not freaking leave oh my god no there's like a thing right under the door I have to get it before I'm out of here freakin I don't know what I'm gonna do but I'm gonna get out of here honestly so just one more thing I want to mention why do I keep doing this I want to do uh I want to do a QA coming up soon so if you're down for that if you want to see that I'll probably end up filming it tomorrow so leave comments down below with any kind of questions you want for this QA I also mentioned that in my last video too but I'm just like honestly the more questions the merrier make them fun crazy unique whatever I don't care don't do the basic kind of questions do like crazy stuff down below comments let's do QA it's gonna be a good time it's gonna be fun okay so yeah now I'm gonna go to the gym as I've like explained before no one cares about the gym so like I'm not gonna show it in depth I guess I'll see you guys after the gym I don't know I don't show the gym in my vlogs cuz I'm not a freakin tool okay sorry two hours later so we're gonna see if there's anything good on the radio I'm only gonna play like one second of each songs I don't wanna get copyrighted but we'll see so let's see what's up hopping right now [Music] control you okay the radio sucks that's why I want to use the Ox but I can't because I need to charge my phone so that's lame and I'm paste but whatever okay peace out you you I'm gonna do a little shoot OOTD for what I'm wearing for my little thingymajig I have going with my friend Lily so first made these pink glasses I freaking love these they're from urban next and these chokers commute the stars going on here and then I have the little diamond D thing going on there both of those are from Brandi um bralette from Free People this is from Brandi these shorts are a Levi's I have little fishnets socks as you can see they're like fishnet socks I don't know I just felt like it and then the converse ah that's my outfit for this little God my outfit for this excursion this is like the first time you'd probably ever seen me with makeup and probably the last time so we're gonna go take some pics at the beach and it's gonna be a good time so let's go are you saying give me my book are you nervous yes she has a freaking iced coffee this is how you know we're friends we're friends she gets me look at this yes brat the beachy look seems pretty good but we're like way too early awake foggy though so I thought you but you want no but over okay tell me if I'm wrong this is a photographer she can like be the judge also I'm gonna leave her link down below if you want to like and subscribe if you want to follow her Instagram she's talented as dude I'm telling you anyway okay Oh overcast light is really good for portrait see cuz you just like there's no harsh shadows and your skin looks so much better so I should go freakin cliff let's go photo shoot time baby let's get some pics Instagram is live she forgot her coffee that's such that's actually a huge issue like I'm so sorry but I mean y'all are too busy taking pics of me so you won't be able to do that anyways that's fine climbed up this thing that's like low-key like you're not supposed to climb of it but our view dog she's a genius that's like hella cool for you [ __ ] I would do like a montage with their wage okay right here yeah I'm a big stereotype for people who live in California is like oh you probably serve well I don't I don't surf and I've never surfed in my life but I really wish I have and I really want to one day so one day I will look I'm freaking pretty busy though taking pictures of not me rude surviving a good all the time out here taking pics to the gram you want to see these in real life go to Mabus go go to my gram I'll probably post a few on the gram why don't you saying it like that it's Instagram but I'll definitely post all of them on my disco or at least all the ones they don't look like a freaking turtle in do you know what the thing is you can't talk you can't spill any teeth when you're blogging it's live stream so if you don't know that people see the difference between vlogging and live-streaming it's like you can edit out the place I'm talking Laurel stories you can't edit a live stream so don't say anything you don't want to be hurt okay danger we did that we did that it's a stay back haha told honestly I'm taking that part out cuz that's just embarrassing no she just did it for the vlog talky ass shoes girl girl bunny bunny is eating paper that's so bad why do people trash the beach god [ __ ] damn do you know what everybody we just saw that bunny eating paper public service announcement don't ever litter on the beach because that cute little bunny could be eating your [ __ ] trash and that makes you a look at it it's eating the trash the bunny is eating the trash no joke look at all the trash and I freaking bunny is eating it littering is no joke kids we're out on the beach it's pretty whatever just took some pics over there by this cool staircase wet but I thought a man was a drone and our plan is I always cut out my burps but everyone so I'll leave them in basically the plan is I'm gonna ask him if he can use airdrop me his drone footage so that I can steal it for my vlog I'll keep in my email and I'll say dude number one hit me up but number two send me your drone footage because like I don't have a drone but like I want my vlogs to be cacey nice that Ash just soak up doesn't man it is wrong [Music] it's just like a man's best friend you know look at a life's pictures of you so you have to get your own to do it timer again serious announcement lettering is a big issue specially on the beach the beach animals are dying I did alarming rate environmental science it changed me you're taking environmental science yeah see she nature she is the freaking future guys like eight out of 30 on my test

THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR 700 SUBS I LOVE U ALL AND APPRECIATE YOU",2017-07-13T16:11:01Z,84078,3266026,10898,"ow, ow! Okay,  just hit my knee (slurps coffe) Hey guys Actually, I'll do the little hand thing i do. hey guys, it's emma. There's a truck driving by let's just wait Today I'm back with another video and  today's video is going to be trendy as f*** So prepare yourself because we gotta get trendy up in here before I start I also want to say that in a video soon I want to do a Q and A you know you ask questions, and I answer them in a video so if you have any questions for me at all, leave them in the Comments below and I will answer most of them. you can make them as weird crazy as you want Whatever you want to know! I'm down. So do that. Thanks, now Let's get into the video. now like you know, this video like I like. I'm not even a bit Okay, I don't even know where to start so basically like everybody talks about slime. There's an Instagram slime videos where people basically like you know just like Mix their fingers around and slime, and then like get kind of famous from it and then like sell their slime I don't even understand how people can sell their slime and make money from that It beats me because it looks like making slime isn't even that hard, so like today in this video I'm going to be making slime, because I want to figure out what it's all about Like I know I'm always late to the game like with these internet trends just cuz I'm like a grandma when it comes to this Stuff but like, it just doesn't come naturally to me you know, but I'm just confused and I want to understand so today I'm going to make my own slime, so that  I can try to really figure out What the deal is, cuz I just don't get it and I want to get it, cuz I feel like you know I'm like I'm a teen in this time, and I need to figure it out. Let's do it Alright ow, so let's get started I guess I have the ingredients on my Computer for like all the stuff that I need to make slime um so supposedly there's like different kinds of slime I guess there's like fluffy slime, but to make fluffy slime you have to use like Lotion, and hand soap, freakin cornstarch and a bunch of other stuff, but like that's way too much work, and I'll care of my slime Fluffy I just want to make slime. That's all I care about I'm just going to make the basic slime and for that I guess you need one bottle of Elmer's glue Which I have like two bottles And I have them in this cup upside down so that like all the glue will like go to the top Does that make sense any borax powder? which I have you need water which I have in the other room and then You need two resealable container so I have this but I don't think it's a container, but a Plastic bag so hopefully that will do now I guess the first step is to dissolve one teaspoon of Borax Powder into a half cup, oh Brb Okay, we're back then we have 1 cup of water. So that's good So I don't really I think it's one of the main reasons Why I'm doing this video is because this seems, so easy So I just don't understand why people sell this when you could literally just make it yourself ummm I Don't know I guess this generation is just lazy which makes sense I mean, I knew that before so I need to get a tea spoon Tea spoon.(congrats) Some tutorials say to use hot water But like I chose the tutorial that says regular room-temperature water because that's easier, and I'm sOo lazy oh (focuses immensely on pouring powder from unreasonable height) Oh My God, just get ready for this *misses bowl * step one completed. One step closer to being a frickin slime god. slime god ok this really isn't dissolving because like obviously you need warm water for stuff to dissolve Well, you can dissolve it in room temperature, but it just takes longer so I want to warm this up Ok i think I'm going to warm this up for like 30 seconds so that it will dissolve easier Brb ok I think they should probably put my hair up because I have this like Internal feeling that things are about to get kind of messy so yeah while my water is warming up I'm just getting prepared for this craft journey Don't know if you can hear that, but my water is done warming up also before I continue I wanted to tell you that I have all of this glitter that I'm going to use to make this the best freakin slime you've Ever seen in your entire life and as you can see I still have my glue here Just chilling upside down because I'm a genius And I want all of it to be sunk to the top learn from me people learn from me, Brb Okay, I am a science ow Every time I sit down and hit my knee on the table. I'm basically a science Master because now that I warmed it up everything is dissolved I Should be paid for this or something. I don't even understand how people can sell their slime and make money from that beats me Okay, so I'm mixing it up still but I'm pretty sure it's basically all dissolved because I'm a science genius and warming it up makes the You know doesn't matter I'm not going to get scientific here to measure out about 1/2 cup of clear glue and mix it with 1/2 cup of water into a well mixed Okay, does that mean it does that mean okay? I don't know okay. Whatever. I'll do that, ding oh No, okay. I think I'm gonna have to do it this way can't get the top off There we go. yes, this is going awesome, okay? Honestly glue itself could just be slime like I'm not even kidding one half of clear Glue well I don't have to clear glue. So sorry buddy one half cup of water until well mixed your wish is my command next Just kidding. I'm not that gross okay? See that I'm kind of concerned because they don't have exactly a half cup and also I just used all the glue. I have at my house for this So this better be worth it it just doesn't turn out good I'm going to be frickin pissed because I just wasted all my glue for this, so I'm gonna be right back I have to go get a half cup of water this tutorial so far is asking for a lot of me I have to get up a lot. I'm not that I'm not a fan but whatever one half cup of water and we have 1/2 cup of glue well not really we have like a little bit less than a 1/2 cup like you can still see it's not like filled up to the Top which is what I wish that I could do But honestly I'm too lazy to sit here like this and wait for all the glue to drain out and not worth my time oh my god so fun. I loved it. This is like I don't understand why people would buy slime when you can enjoy this kind of experience like waste your precious money on Buying slime when you could literally have a diy at home Oh my God diy the internet loves diy. So why wouldn't you just? Diy it freaking do it yourself? God don't understand people these days if everybody loves diy's so much Why don't we all just diy slime and stop wasting your money online? honestly though if you have bought slime before like from one of the instagram accounts or anything like that if you bought like some slime from an Instagram site let me know why let me know your reasoning because I respect it like if you have like if you like a Valid reason like that's totally cool, but just like you explain it to me cuz I like don't really get it ew I splattered it all over me, borax water solution ok so far nothing. I'm just saying I'm just mixing I'm mixing as I pour because I'm afraid oh my God. It's happening. It's happening. God, okay, probably ah it's happening I'm right back on. It's forming. It's like a human creature. It's like whoa I don't know if I'm supposed to add food coloring and stuff right now about even care. I need to do this oh My God okay? Oh my God okay? I need to add food coloring now um. What color am I going to do? I don't know. It's still really liquidy. Oh sit says to get your hands oh My God, this is so freaking fun. Haha. Oh my God. It's so soft Oh, okay, okay, okay? This is some last minute decision, but I need to get another Bowl, and I'm gonna separate this big slime It's not really big but like I'm just separate it into two Separate slimes so that I can  like make two different slimes because I want to make a more traditional slime And then I'm going to make a slime that's like really personalized to me. You know I'm just going to use this bowl for one and I'm going to use, I'm just a mess. I'm a literal mess right now I'm going to use this humongous bowl for one slime, and then this other one for another slime so so far I think this is going good, okay but I feel like everybody's slime that They have online is like so much. Less liquidy than this like I don't know how to make this less liquid it kind of reminds me of snot like I'm not even gonna Lie. This is like Boogers its alright with me though. Oh my God gross Maybe if I add a little bit more borax because I think that's the stuff that makes it hard So I think if I add a little bit more borax  to this it might be a little bit less wet You know because I feel like it's so wet like that's just not what I'm going for I want the kind of slime that you can just like you know put your finger around in you know instead of making it so Liquidy because it's cool, but it's just not what I'm looking for so I'm gonna wash my hands real quick. actually who am I kidding? I'm not going to wash my hands. That's such a waste of my time I Don't know if anything's changing. I need to add more when in doubt add more That's kind of a lot Wait, am I making it more liquidy? It's more liquidy now does this mean I need to add more glue this is like a chemical reaction that I just don't understand it kind of messed this one up because I just like Added too much borax to it which confuses me because I thought that when the more borax you add The more like solid it gets I'm kind of disappointed with myself cause I kind of ruined it, and that's like all the glue I have I might have more glue though, so I may go look, but if not that I just screw this up But you know what at least I still have this I am the the new upcoming slime Bae okay, so all I found was this glitter glue So I'm just gonna like squirt this in here and see what freaking happens cuz I feel like this could be really cool It's like you know you mix glitter glue in it cuz then It's like automatic like glitter glue, and that's just like really cool right wait what it's like. It's like Just like breaking and it looks like cereal like it's just breaking into little pieces like it doesn't it's not actually working I guess you need to use elmer's glue all right, okay, honestly. I'm giving up on this this one I'm just going to only use this other one. Which is right here. I'm obviously going to add green. Why? Because what color is snot? whoo Oh my God. It's dripping all over my leg okay, okay, so I'm mixing up this slime right now And I'm not even going to lie to you guys it hella looks good I'm proud of this and very extremely proud so now that is like a little live slime bae. I'm going to take him out look at him Oh my God, why doesn't everyone do this okay? Okay? Okay? Okay, emma don't freak out. It's okay. I'm like I'm kinda freaking out cuz I'm so excited. I'm going to let him come out on the table. Come on little guy, okay? He's sliding everywhere I regret this decision. I regret it. Okay. Maybe being a slime guru isn't as easy as I thought awww look It's like a little path down to my slime dude Look at him like leaking into my table, but whatever now that I have him over here I'm going to add some glitter into him Because that's like what all the other slime people do so I think I'm going to add in the color Red because I like Christmas, and I think that it would be a little bit fun. So I'm just sprinkling it Whatever, my slime is a little bit more like what even like the instagram people But I'm still going to try to do the thing that they all do where they go like this. They're like This is so fun Look at this Christmas slime. Ha that's a thumbnail right there I kind of get why people buy it because like you know this is kind of messy I mean look this mess I just made like was this really worth it for this much slime actually yes, it was completely worth it I don't even know what I'm talking about No, I just got it onto my ugg boots or not my Ugg boots but my Ugg slipper and my moms Okay, hold on. This is turning. This is this slime is turning bad things are things are happening right now I don't know if you can see that, but these Slippers are my actual child and I need to clean this off before it ruins my slipper, Brb I'm kind of panicking, but you know what I haven't gotten any on my computer yet And that's actually the most important thing as you can see this is what we have going here It's kind of a mess honestly doesn't look great, but it doesn't look horrible? Oh? God no no no? This might ruin my slipper, but you know what if nothing can ruin these slippers because they are my bae for life I don't even care we've been through everything together if this stays on here It'll be a memory of today the day that I finally figured out that slime is not something I'm good at making but it's something that I enjoy to make and this marks the first day that I've ever made slime so like If you think about it, it's not really a big deal that this this might ruined my Ugg slipper, and Ugg slippers are extremely overpriced So that's cool. Just makes it ten times more painful to my heart, but anyway yeah, that's like about fine Now it's looks horrible, whatever okay, when it dries You'll barely be able to freakin see it this slime is all over Everything like it's all over everything mom if you're watching this I'm sorry okay back to Okay, I'm going to move my laptop before this gets like too messy because like you know That's the kind of thing that you really don't want to get slime on especially cuz it's so sticky just sticks to everything But it's like the only problem is though that it's like this slime like this is like the only part that I can salvage this Is like all I have left the rest is just stuck to the table. So that kind of sucks I don't really know how people like I think the main problem here is is that I used like this simple slime recipe I didn't use like the famous instagram slime recipe, but I mean okay. I actually have some left right here He's just like my little friend. You know he's fun. He's cute, but the problem is he's so sticky You just can't even do anything with him You know what I mean? like he's just like he's just sticky like he doesn't do anything for me like he's not helping me Why would somebody buy this I don't know overall this slime recipe sucks I'd say if you're going to make slime on your own don't make this kind because I'm not getting anything out of this like this Is just like dumb like this is it's fun. I guess but it's not like the kind of slime That's like the instagram slime where you like can like move your finger around in it and stuff It's just like sucky slime So I say don't make this unless I mean if you want to like do something fun if you're like babysitting a kid actually your babysitting a kid do not do this with them because they'll make a mess throughout their house and then The parents will come home, and they'll be like really mad at you And you will never be invited back because this is like the most messy thing I've ever Experienced in my life, and not only is it messy, but it's like hard to clean off so like don't yeah Don't do this with kids because they'll get way too excited and your house will be destroyed now the glitter is everywhere I mean glitter is already bad like glitter already sticks to everything but now that it's like in slime this glitter is everywhere like it's all over my Ugg slipper my Ugg slipper is like Destroyed and it has glitter all over it that I just can't even get off overall this video was completely pointless It was a fail You couldn't even see what I was doing because I was doing it in this big blue Bowl of this big yellow or not yellow I'm an idiot White Bowl, so you couldn't even see what I was doing. So this is basically the most pointless video I've ever done and now I have to clean up this mess. What was the point of this? I have no clue but if you liked it give it a thumbs up check out my other videos that are a little bit less dumb than this it's Probably the dumbest things that are done thats all I have for you today Subscribe my channel if you want, I mean honestly after watching this video I don't know why you'd want to subscribe to me But like check out my other videos first because they may be better than this one I don't know comment down below anything you want if you want to comment down below Explaining slime because I still don't really get it.

So in today's video I'm going to do probably one of the most self-explanatory things That you could ever do and that's making peanut butter cups if you also watched my vlog yesterday, you heard me talk about how Instructional videos were not my path, and I wasn't going to do that anymore because well, I mean That's just not my path and no, it's not a recipe video So don't get excited to get like directions from me because to be completely honest. I'm probably never going to do that again I'm not kind of like a you know advice Youtuber even though I kind of tried to be in the beginning Just didn't work out for me wasn't wasn't my path, you know Um Well this video could be considered instructional, but considering that I don't know s*** about what I'm doing right now I don't really think it's an instructional video and instead I guess we're just going to kind of hang out and you can like watch Me try to make these and then if you want to make them you can. Basically it's just like cooking with me like I'm not Showing you how to do this, but like you're just going to hang out with me while I do it And It's probably going to be a fail because, or it's not going to be a fail because you can't really fail at making this But like it's not going to be like cute. You know it's nothing like *diy music plays* ""okay like here's how you make it okay like"" ""Tweet me pictures if you make it please like I love you"" :D You know no, it's not me like that doesn't how I roll but yeah, we're gonna make peanut butter cups And It's gonna be f*****g fun, so like stick around if you're down if you're not it's fine Come back tomorrow because I have like a better video But like I mean, I think this will be fun to like let's do it Lets fricken do it. Lets do it. Lets make peanut butter cups. Peanut butter cups. Homemade. DIY. Ooh. DIY. DIY peanut butter cups do-it-yourself reecees. f*** you reecees just kidding don't if you want to sponsor me that's fine But we're gonna diy it right now, okay, whatever You know you can click off if you want, but like please stay though. Cuz I feel like we could have fun so like you know There's like a potential there. They're just potential okay. Well here we are basically what I have is I have dark chocolate 85% because you know what, I like dark chocolate, and I like it real dark, okay really dark next we have Santa Cruz creamy light roasted peanut butter. This is the best peanut butter actually in Loris gutter brands pretty good, too But this is definitely good natural peanut butter is just better. I'm sorry I'm not trying to be like some sort of like you know healthy peanut butter activist But it just tastes better so don't be dumb and buy the other one okay um if you are allergic to peanuts like probably half The population I feel like everybody's freaking allergic to peanuts No offense to you if you're allergic to peanuts that must kind of suck And I'm sorry because peanut butter is fricking good. *one like = on prayer for people allergic to peanuts* You could use almond butter. You could use cashew butter You could use sunflower butter :D don't feel left out if you can't have peanuts because options for you are endless so get over it. So yeah So let's actually get started I'm not going to like add a bunch of other shit to it because I don't really care enough, so yeah I need to like figure out I think you're supposed to use like a cupcake liner to like give it the little lines on the side *prettiness* You know so like I need to find that somewhere. Oh easy found it AhHH This videos going really well so far. So I have these oh my God. They're perfect size too - holy crap It's like this video was made for me to make guys Guys, I'm telling you if one door closes like you know what the video I was supposed to post today Yeah, it sucked. It really sucked But do you know what don't ever give up follow your dreams because now I'm making this video and so far It's going freaking awesome. I am just this video is the best thing I'm ever going to put on the internet This is wow this is called quality content. So like get excited these are perfect these are freaking Parchment mini baking cup goals okay, so I think oh God okay? So I think what I need to do next is I need to like melt is this even on me because I am the most Important part of this. I need to melt this I don't know I mean like melting really dark chocolate is hard because like Basically just cocoa powder like there's not like anything in it that would melt like it's not very soft. You know But we're going to make it happen right now Just gonna break it, probably should've taken the foil off fir- This is a mess, I thought this video was going well, and it's not But you know what,  we're going to turn this sh** around right? I'm gonna break it up a little bit more because I feel like it Why? Don't put- don't mix the foil in it if you're making this at home with me right now Which nobody is like everybody's always like oh, yeah? I'm making a cooking video like come on like let's do it together like no No one ever does it with you at the same time who are we kidding? Okay, that's annoying it's all over my hands looks like I took a sh** on my hands, but whatever throwing this away Alright, I give you a little tutorial on how to use my microwave like you know put it in turn it on but like why? would I like Ruin this camera angle that is just so quality the best camera angle you've ever seen why would I ruin this? Just so that you could see me use my microwave See, that's the thing I wouldn't do that So I'm just going to microwave this and then I'll come back when it's microwaved if you want to know a little inside scoop I'm probably going to do it in 30 second intervals Wild!  I bet you didn't already guess that because like if you warm up your chocolate like a lot then it'll it's bad Then you like burn it or something. I don't care you don't care either. I'm just going to warm this up right now I'm going to snap okay. This is Gonna be cool. It's gonna be really cool I'm a snap and then it's going to like be melted. Okay you ready three two one. I hope that worked Okay umm, so I'm filming right now, but just a quick interjection right now I don't know if it's still going on but my fu*****g dog is humping my cat Oh My God, I don't I don't know. I don't know okay. I don't know okay So basically the chocolates now melted and while that was warming up as you can see my dog was humping my cat But besides that yeah, i just had to like  you know interject because I was like trying to just like cook in peace But then also and I hear some rustle and  bustle going on in the other room room, and I was like well Let me check it out and sadly I had to catch my two pets just really you know if you are under 13. I'm so sorry What you saw is not what you think that was actually just them fighting. They were just fighting That was it that was that was all okay? That's it. Don't tell your parents don't tell anybody that you saw that okay? Okay, so basically we have this chocolate melted, and I have these little things going on here well While I was warming up the chocolate basically I had a little bit of time to lay these out because I'm a chef so what can I say? So maybe it's gonna like pour it in you know, I don't really know what there is to say about it honestly I'm not following any directions. I'm just winging in it, but like and I'm kind of proud of myself not gonna l- okay should I like put something under this, okay I should probably put something something under it under this That's what I like to call problem solving Back to business okay, so I'm kind of like thinking about this right now. And I'm like okay. Oh wait I never actually put anything under it. Okay. That's something I don't Okay, we're back. We're back. I was thinking and I'm like well if I just put the peanut butter in right now That would be bad because then it would probably just sink to the bottom and then it wouldn't be like you know a peanut butter Cup where the peanut butter is in the center because that's like kind of important you know oh, God oh, God It's filling okay This is bad. You know and that would be kind of like Defeating the purpose and like I have basically one job right now, and that's just to make this not suck really bad. Oh s***t I probably should've sprayed this with coconut oil or something F*** it whatever To late now.  So I think what I have to do is I think I have to put this in the freezer for a little bit so that gets hard, and then I can like put The peanut butter on it, and it won't sink to the bottom, you know what I mean? I'm going to do that So far, this isn't going to bad I mean, I made a little bit of a mess in thats you know expected so so far everythings going okay? so I'm gonna freeze these and then I'll see you in like 15 minutes or something oh God Did my hair just get in it? No.  And I'll see you in 15 minutes when these are all frozen up And I can do my little layer of peanut butter Okay peace out. I'm putting all these pieces of trash away because these peanut butter to superior butter form or no oh Ow! I hit my elbow it's probably Karma for talking bad about all these nut butters I'm putting them all away because peanut butter is obviously superior. Almond  butter is pretty good too, but the rest I don't even give a shit about the rest honestly Okay we're back, and it's kind of dark out now, so I need to hurry this video freaking up because it's like 7:51 and I need to go so let's do this How am I going to do that? I suppose would melt this but like do you really think I'm going to do that, no. I think earlier I was supposed to like shake out the air bubbles or something, but like I didn't do that So this whole thing might be a complete fail. But we'll see. We will see later. I think also I heard that like most people who do like youTube like cooking videos or something, They make the recipe like the night before and then like the next day They like show everybody them cooking it And then they'll have like an already finished version of it It already finished Version of the food like in the fridge already done So that like they show you them making it and then show it already done But see that's the thing about like professional people and me is that like I'm not gonna freakin do that So now I have all this chunky ass peanut butter in here and It just does not look very good But we're going to cover it with chocolate and see what happens because that's kind of like my life's motto Cover it with chocolate and see what happens Duh, don't take that the wrong way. We're almost there I put so mu- if you want to know anything about me know that I love Peanut butter and like I will put it a lot of it on everything like I'll eat so much of it in one sitting like It's probably unhealthy So I decided what better thing to do then put a crap ton of peanut butter on here and the thing too is that peanut Butter kinda gives me a stomachache like I don't know if that happens to any of you guys But if I eat too much peanut butter it will easily give me a stomachache and so right now I'm basically just like setting myself up for failure, but like you know since when have I cared like since when has a stomachache ever stopped me from eating everything that I want actually it has before, but that's beside the point I'm like Overflowing this little parchment thing with freaking ingredients But you know I don't even care because I don't know I don't care you know what like I'm just all I'm trying to do is make some peanut butter cups right now like that is my only light priority Nothing else to me matters more in my life than this that's just so not true. But okay am I even filming right now? Thank oh my, actually thank God like actually thank God There was like a good chance that this just wasn't filming and like it is so I just wanna like Thank not only God with Jesus anyway now that I have this all completed I'm gonna put this in the freezer for a little bit more and then I'm gonna freakin eat it and we're all going to just Like watch me eat. It. It's going to be gross, but like the problem is though Is that like it's no joke eight o'clock at  night and dark chocolate has caffeine in it so like I'm not going to sleep tonight at all but then at the same time i have to edit this video. So it's like you know give and take Like, I was going to be up anyway, but *sigh * Let's put it in the freezer, uhh. Okay, tha-, okay, okay. Hmm. Oh Do you know what if you're learning anything from this video. You have to do what you have to do. Okay? I think i just got it on my necklace. This is a mess this video is a mess I don't even know who I am anymore, Okay I'm done I- this is bad. This is really bad. This is not cute This is not cute. Okay? Okay, Finally it's time to reveal I went outside because um the lighting is better whatever um because I decided to film this late at night because I'm dumb Well it's not late at night, but like it's like eight o'clock okay? That's late for me basically. Let's just unbox Okay Looks like the peanut butter isn't really melted or is it okay? Okay, not gonna Lie like the sides I'm kind of proud of that reese's peanut butter cup whoo No, joke reese's is like concerned like I am coming for them like they're worried. Okay. Let's try it. Ow Mm-Hmm Oh my God, I feel like I'm choking on peanut butter. Uh I need to go clean off my face This was the most spare of the moment video I think I've ever done in my life um But do you know what? What did I get out of it some Frickin Dark chocolate peanut butter cups honestly? They tasted freakin good I mean like you can't mess it up like I mean you could but like I Be pretty hard to mess it up.  If you want to try it at home, try it at home. Tweet me a picture No I'm just kidding please don't do that. I mean you can- actually no You wouldn't do that anyway, so it's fine. Okay. Not gonna lie the little ridges on the side You know like the like reese's peanut butter cup ridges not going to lie I kind of nailed that okay not trying to toot my own horn, but kinda nailed it So that was cool um you know that was today's video. What even was it. I don't know you tell me um Yes, that was it for today tomorrow I promise I'll have a more, no- You know what today's video is great. Okay?

Just like lunged out and like tried to go down my throat Thank God that didn't happen look at freaking this see my mom asked me to do the dishes and originally I was like frick No, actually I did do them so I'm like a good kid, but whatever okay this soap Just needs to do something. So I made a fricking snowman a freaking snowman, how fricking cool is that? Ah man. Goodbye no, I can't um but anyway The moral of the story is I'm a really good daughter. I made a snowman and I also did the dishes I don't know what more you could ask for before I start the vlog I think I'm going to do a little OOTD. You know summertime ootd first We have this case um shout out to Wildflower cases. this is a dope case. I really dig it next we have these sunglasses Probably some of my faves pacsun next we have a shell necklace can you even see that shell necklace pretty wet? I dig it um this thing. I don't even know what the hell it is, but I love it Oh my God, it's so I don't know something about it. Good good Just like surfer vibes ok. This is from urban um I dig it also these little weird short Fabrics shorts are from Brandi you know the usu.  this is definitely a fricking weird outfit, but I dont even care then I'm wearing rainbows I have a nice little sock tan going And then I have a little anklet thing from the brand me to we so that is my outfit today today I am vlogging I wasn't really planning on it, but I was like you know what why not give the people what they want you know yeah? So yeah, Im gonna vlog today. Take you through my day. I have a few little things. I have to do am I leaving now? I think Im leaving now Yeah, I'm leaving right now. I'm gonna go drive places. Uh do I have everything I need? Bye Make sure you let me know what you're going to get Okay, all right. That was like a really-. I thought you were like mad at me or something okay? Anyway going now, okay? Starting out today's vlog in the car. What what else? Do we know how to do better than that? Extremely pissed off right now. But we're just going to set this up again and do the entire clip again Okay, um actually who am I kidding try not to lose my freaking shit right now? I just filmed the whole entire clip and the entire thing was friggin Blurry and now person's going to walk by so I need to Stop filming because because I'm afraid of judgement back to business now. So yeah I just filmed the whole entire clip about a bunch of freaking random stuff And it was all blurry the whole thing was blurry. I actually am going to cry It was like five minutes long. Just me talking Blurry Let's try that again. Is it even filming it did even like I don't even know. I hope it's not blurry this time okay? Well, we can just hope so the first thing I was talking about was how Basically you know how the iphone there's only one hole and it's basically the charging hole on the new iPhone 7 great Sick dope awesome okay, so basically you have to use this adapter to plug into the Aux But then while you're using the aux on the iPhone 7 you can't charge your phone at the same time see that's a problem for Me because I use my phone so much that it needs to be charging almost constantly and yeah So that's that so that pisses me off So what I decided to do was take my old iphone and just use this to play music And then I can use my phone for nothing I can just charge it so like apple That's cool and all and I love you like. I love you, but like that's a little bit annoying So that's a little life hack for the day. Just use your old phone for your music and then use your new phone for nothing Awesome now that I've basically cooled down after the fact that the entire clip that I filmed it was blurry I'm kinda going to talk about what I'm doing today me right now. I'm going to a surf shop that. I never knew existed I'm actually going to go there now I never knew the surf shop existed at all honestly And it's surprising because it's literally in my town um so I'm kind of an idiot for not knowing For not knowing that it exists, but yeah, so I'm going there now And I've been interesting lately because it's basically like getting clothes for so cheap Like why would you not like that? I don't know this old lady thinks. I'm psycho. She literally thinks I'm insane I am we've been over that and then after that going to whole foods because I had to pick up some stuff for a video That I'm filming because as you know I've been posting more people I don't know, but maybe you do now so I don't know let me know wait. That was me I said no too many times I've been trying to post every day so like That's why I need to do this and no it's not a recipe video So don't get excited to get like directions from me because to be completely honest I'm probably never going to do that again like I'm not kind of like a you know Advice YouTuber even though I kind of tried to be in the beginning didn't work out for me was it wasn't my path? You know so right now I'm going to throw shop, and I'm going to go to Whole foods pick up what I need for my video Think it'll be a good video. We'll see then after that I'm going to come home for a little bit and then I'm going to the gym because you know what grind time, baby You know what I mean at all That's today um thank you. Oh my God. You said that out loud, and they can't hear me They don't know who I am they don't hear me talking so that embarrassing just Freaking ran into the curb like it's freaking savage I do abuse the word savage I'm sorry, but anyway, so that's today taking you along with me enjoy. See you at the first shop See this is why I believe that the iPhone 6 was Actually genius because looks I can just have this Play freaking Spotify for me like a savage like like it You know just doing its frickin job, and then this phone all I can do is frickin charge with it not good It's not great. Why are we downgrading? Why is that happening Apple? Why? Why why why did you? Why did you get rid of this beautiful thing you had going here this beautiful thing you had gone here Why did you ruin it? Why did you ruin it? Sorry those kind of violent? I swear I'm not violent. I swear isil We're okay, let's go to the surf shop now basically I just like Accidentally drove like an idiot for a solid like one minute like just like I just made like 14 different mistakes It wasn't a big deal like at all um but I was driving like a kind of like an idiot, but yeah So some lady got hella mad at me and was like trying to be like oh my God I'm sorry like I was accidentally in a turn lane And then I like had to switch out of it really fast, and it was just like a lot Okay, um none of it was like illegal like it's all legal is just like last-minute decisions You know because I kind of got confused for a sec anyway, well um I? Last-minute pulled into a parking spot like really fast cuz like I was about to miss it you know and then like one day drove By me like because I got pulled into the parking spot And they were like behind me When they like drove by they were both freaking looking at me so angry because I like pulled into the spot so fast But I'm like and I've even put my blinker on like I'm not like it I'm not the freakin devil, but they were looking at me like I was literally like Satan um so that kind of happened And I'm a little bit freaked out because I feel like they're going to come back and try to kill me for them We'll see what happens. I'll let you know if anybody finds this clip, and I'm dead That's why so let's go to thrift shop now Let's go shopping, and I was going to make a macklemore reference, but I just decided you know what Emma You already suck enough like don't make it worse. You know Okay, update. We're back in the car. It was freakin hot af in there. Oh my God. I was like dying It was literally the temperature was just not not okay, and they did not have air-conditioning So I was dying but I got some really freaking cool stuff And this is literally like a thrift shop in my town like in it always kind of like scared me away But like I decided to go out on the land today and freaking go in and gosh, dang it I am glad I did because I got some really cool stuff So I'm actually going to go home right now Before I continue my day and just film a little stripped all while I'm still excited about this stuff Pedestrians have the Right-of-way, haha I'm gay anyway, so yeah I'm gonna go home and film a little sort all right now Because I would show you guys everything I got but it's honestly enough to do a haul So like why not right make a whole video out of it because the more videos the better, so I was definitely impressed Definitely happy with how it all turned out Oh my God my streets blocked off what the am I supposed to do they blocked off my street for a farmers market, okay? How am I supposed to get to my house? How am I supposed to get my house, okay? I need to figure something out I literally think right But how can I be mad after I just picked up some dope stuff and like I can't turn on the Ac while I'm filming Because I don't want to like am I even filming right now. I better be fricking filming. Okay. Good well It's like 104 just getting started with the day, so filming a thrift Haul. Here's all the stuff just kidding You saw I will not Showing you what I got right now That would freaking spoil it and then nobody would watch the video and I'd be horrible so right now I'm about to go to Whole foods and pick up stuff for another video All right last time we talked um I Don't know when it was but it was probably about an hour ago So I was originally saying I was about to get my keys and we're about to go to Whole foods whatever, okay? Well, I sat down because like I couldn't find my mom and I wanted to like tell her I was leaving and I like texted her and she just Like wasn't responding She's like walking the dogs or whatever so they are I want to like say goodbye to her face-to-face before I leave okay So I was waiting and then I got in bed, and then I was like editing I started editing my thrift haul, and I was just like once I started like could not stop I just needed to finish editing before I left. I think it turned out. Well, I'm excited I'm probably going to post that actually before this vlog goes up because I already finished editing it and everything so yes That's a cool video. Get pumped for that even though It's already up So I don't know what's the point of this is and now I'm going to Whole foods to Pick up some stuff for another video that I'm filming within the next Few days Back from the Whole foods excursion. I am so excited right now because I just picked up some stuff for a video It's a surprise. I can't say anything, but I'm literally so excited about this video It's gonna be freaking hilarious because you'll see oh my god. I'm so excited um. I'm pumped. I'm riding in a why Do you right now? I'm pumped. How'd my coffee right here? Ladies staring at me. What's freaking new like no job? What's new so forgetting that ah okay? Anyway? That's the point so right now I'm gonna go home, and then I'm making my gym stuff and then in the mood of a gin Which is so boring like nobody's freaking cares, but I'll take you with me anyway I was genuinely considering wearing these socks these are a little bit inappropriate Considering there's like a there's like a little daycare at the gym that I go to so like little kids would be walking by And then they'd read my socks, and they'd be like Mommy What is scoffs mean? And then the parents would be like where did you see that and then they'd be like that girl over there? And then I would be like oh, so probably better if I don't So this is like. I have my workout clothes under this But I'm just going to wear this in public for a little bit like no jokes. This is what I'm wearing This is this is bad This is really bad like it doesn't even look like I'm wearing pants if you want to see this jacket and more details on it Check out my thrift haul. It's going to be up at some point Don't know when I'm going to go pee real quick, and then I'm Gonna go to the gym Okay, a few things occurred on this little ride here number one this light is frickin Just gold in our ass not really but you know so basically the first thing that happened was I was playing a song By noah cyrus right okay miley cyrus is a little sister because um it's like low-key a slap like I don't admit it But it's like kind of good okay, whatever so it's like listening to it. You know. It's getting my pop music fix I'm not normally one for pop music, but I mean it was it's a pretty good song anyway Well if anybody knows the movie Ponyo like the movie Pawnee, okay? Whatever Noah Cyrus was in it in like it was like there was like some songs that she sang in it as well so basically right after spotify played the song by Noah cyrus it like recommend Or it just like automatically started playing a for him song from Ponyo the movie Because like that was like apparently another song that noah cyrus did on and it was like on spotify so it just like Automatically went from the song I was listening to you To a frickin ponyo song and I couldn't like do anything about it because I was like driving And it was like kind of an intense time like there was like. I was like Maneuvering through traffic so I don't listen to the whole entire ponyo song which if you don't know what the movie is I guess it's like some sort of like anime like Children's Disney movie pixel I don't know, but it was at Disney or not Disney through the children's movie song so you can just imagine how Painful that was for me okay. Anyway, continuing then I freaking drive into The driveway of my gym, and some just freaking savage dude is on his BMX bike He's like Thirty. I swear. He's like thirty and he's freaking pedaling on that thing I wish I could have filmed him But I couldn't cuz I was obviously driving and also just would have been kind of rude to him if I like filmed him you Know because he probably doesn't want that himself on the internet. He was bmXing. So hard. He was just pedaling Oh my God I'ts one of things you know had to be there But whatever kinda wanted to share that with somebody because it was so freakin funny like I was I Wish I would have filmed it but and he just like thought. He was the coolest thing ever I'm like dude You're like 30, but like bro 100% BMX life. I respect it so yeah, so I'm at the gym now I don't really want to go in ever I kind of want to stay in the car forever But I mean you have to do what you have to do So I guess I'm going to go work out if you want to see my workout routine. I have a video on my channel Go check it out. Whatever. I'm not going to like show my workout because it's like the same as my workout routine That's already on my channel. So why would I do that? Anyway, I'll see you after the gym peace Thank God that's over that was freaking horrible um who's surprised. I'm not okay? Um yes, I was the gym on clean nothing more to say about that. Yeah I think if I head home, I don't know what else I'm going to do today, but I'll keep you posted I guess I'm freaking hungry. I had to go to the grocery store freaking again this I Cannot show you because it's going to be in a video coming up, but I Also, got broccoli. Ooh fun I got ok you can barely see cuz I got limes and then I got some sparkling water They didn't have the La Croix brand Pretty pissed about it. Not going to lie all my vibes crushed just Demolished you know I had to get like the basic like Crystal Crystal geyser Freakin boring, it's not going to taste the same It's not the same as La Croix, La Croix is like actually cool and like everybody drinks those and like nobody drinks Crystal geyser Nobody's a loser I'm just kidding this literally takes taste the same so Lacroix one just has a cooler can and it's like two dollars more expensive Because I'm just looking in a wing like that. Okay. Bye as you can see here. We have a nice little pretty sunset Going on alrighty. Well, I need to leave I've been sitting in this spot and jamming out. Wait is my break off Okay, anyway, basically. I've just been kind of driving around Cuz the sunset was pretty freaking bomb tonight. I mean wow. Yeah, it's really dope I'm not even gonna lie to you right now. So yeah, that was today's vlog. I hope you enjoyed it Definitely spare the moment honestly at this point All my videos are just kind of spare at the moment so like I don't even feel like anybody gets shocked anymore When I have just like a super random freaking video. I think vlogging makes me more productive Don't ask me why but yeah, so just kind of driving around Listening to music well obviously I'm not right now because I don't want to get copyrighted Okay, I have like a phobia of being copyrighted I don't know why it scares the crap out of me But I feel like I'm just going to like go to jail or something and it just scares me Yeah, so that was today's vlog I hope you enjoyed it if you did give this video a big thumbs up subscribe to my channel if you like my videos Check out my other videos because I have quite a few I think I've been on youtube for at least a month by now, so I have a few things you can check out ya comment down below anything you want anything your heart desires I believe in you you can do it.

If you're new to my channel- wait...too soon, too soon- and today, I'm back with another video Today, I'm going to be doing a thrift haul. I'm pretty excited about it This is my second thrift haul on my channel. My first one, I did a while ago if you want to check that out. I'll leave a link in the description and you can check it out. Yes so This is my second thrift Haul. I wasn't really planning on doing this video honestly I didn't think I was going to pick up this much stuff, but I really scored today so I'm going to show you what I got okay, so I'll just start out by saying that I start out by saying that I Bought all this for 25 dollars, and I bought a crap ton of stuff So let's get into it alright, to start out this haul. This is also a try on haul, because you're welcome Okay, starting out this Haul. I have this humongo Yellow which is my new favorite color well one of them anyways Just like Crewneck hoodie, and this is by the brand the brand of this is Izod And I actually really frickin like the brand Izod if you check out my last thrift haul I also hauled something by this brand And I don't know this is just like a freaking awesome. Hoodie like it's still soft inside Which is like the best thing ever and it's like a size large so like I can just sleep in this Kind of smells like a thrift store, but besides that I love it really excited about finding this because I love hoodies I'm like a hoodie Junkie So like, well not hoodie, but like sweatshirt kind of thing you know so that was a cool find, okay? Next thing is a little bit weird, but just like try to I think during the Try on portion you'll get it more. It's just this Like weird brown mock neck t-shirt. Just look at the Tryon. It'll make more sense It's cute. It's like a really like stretchy material, so it would be good for like tying It's like genuinely vintage like it's like actually an old shirt like this is not like a new shirt You know I can tell by the tag this is not new but yeah so pretty excited about this I have a few ideas on how I can style it and Yeah, next I have this shirt. Which is just weird so just like follow me here. I know it's weird It's like a tennis shirt or something way what brand is it? It's gap. I don't know okay Just like put up with me for a second. I'll show you in the trial I'm going to try to cut this like turn into kind of a crop top and See what happens so after I turn it into the crop top then you can determine what you think about it? I don't know It's like you'd be cool so like we'll see if it turns out like a fail like I'll you know you'll be able to tell Ya if I crop this I feel like I could do in urban outfitters Look with this so we'll see you can be the judge of that Okay, little interjection here this talk turned out way cooler than I thought But also keep in mind it kind of flares out right now, but after I wash it it will go down straight So just like keep that mind don't judge hash like no hate I'm just going oh, but yeah So just like wait, and I might even like take it in on the sides so picture it kind of more like You know fitting a little bit less awkward, but I think you get the basic idea of what I'm trying to go for here I think it turned out kind of cool soft sounds like a belt in Sports Bra, so That's fun, right Okay, next I got this was probably the best thing I got it was like eight dollars for this and just prepare yourself This is not really a summer item, but just like just get over it alright. It'll be fine. So I got this frickin huge corduroy lowline dickies jacket And I am telling you I have never been more excited about a Frickin thrift purchase in my life watching the next day I'm to show you I'm pretty excited about - I'm not gonna Lie But this is so freaking nice and like I don't know I just feel like Jackets like this are just so like timeless like you just never like go wrong with something like this And I have no joke been looking for something like this for so long and they have one on Brandy for a while But it was just so expensive this one was eight dollars, and it's like genuinely like lined 100% with like this bulk is the inside the sleeves is like a different material, but you know what I mean It's like line with this super nice ah I'm so excited about this. I'm not gonna lie to you right now I'm so excited about it So yeah, so it's a medium so it's going to be a perfect immense medium so it's going to be like this perfect oversized Fun time and I'm excited about it. So my last clothing item is Okay, I don't know if you've been seeing all of the freaking like every like just Trendy instagram girl I don't even know how to like describe her But you know what I mean having to wear these kinds of pants And I was originally kind of like Like that's a little weird like I don't know if I can pull that off To be quite honest the reason why I didn't want to get them is because I didn't think I could pull them off to like I just kind of went out on a limb and I'm like Frickin honestly like Let's just do it. So I found these pants, okay They're camo, and they're like the cargo pants like they're like this full-on like Cargo pants but these aren't just like You know like how most people will just buy like the fake just like pants from like zoomies like I'm pretty sure you can literally buy them from zoomies like that kind of like camo pants that everybody wears well these are like actual camo pants like the label I don't know if you can like tell I'm not even going to play put ever into this these are like Actual like army pants like neither actually ones it like people in the army where like they'll I have all these likes they're not like they look at even having a number in it would you plug an see but it literally had like a Stamped number in it like these are like kind of intense pants intense pants But like I thought they were so dope and I think I know how I would style them and it would be so cool So like I'm just going to like when I do the Tryon section maybe you'll understand more With your kind of pants like hit or miss like you either Love it, or you hate it like there's really no in-between But I'm so excited because I know how I would style these and I know I could just make it Really freaking cool, so I'm pretty pumped about that okay to finish off this haul It kind of turned out to be a little bit shorter than I thought but a video is a video right I got two belts Tends to be my trend although thrift shopping and then I'll buy belts just because I think Belts are like really expensive if you want to buy them from like a normal place so like if you want to go thrifting you Can get cheap belts and that's really good, so I'll show you the ones I got so the first one I got is just this like tan Belt with like a silver little buckle and honestly I kind of could see this with white jeans So I thought to be really cute It isn't definitely act like this was more of like a preppy belt like with a more preppy outfit But I still think it's cool this next belt. I think is really just like overall and just like You know it's just like wow okay anyway It's just like a nice belt, and it is faux leather of course all my vegans out there calm down. I'm also Vegetarian so don't come at me. I'm not vegan, but I'm vegetarian okay anyway I'm kind of being I won't get into it But I just tell everybody I'm a vegetarian so that nobody gets mad if I won't have honey or something like that, you know Okay, continuing on the spell. I don't know what I'm doing with it, but basically I think this is a cool belt I don't have anything with like a gold buckle actually I probably do no I think I do I think I got whatever but I think this is a cool belt I think this would be I don't know something just like Also, kind of preppy ice-like belt or kind of prep you go whatever I think that that could be a really just a great addition to my closet, and I'm not mad at it So that's about it. That's everything I have for you today all the things I picked up at the thrift store If you like served hauls give this a some if you like thrift hauls or hauled in general I mean who doesn't right give this a thumbs up subscribe to my channel if you're new and you like me and what I'm doing Please yeah, thank you so much for watching What else is there to say thank you guys so much for coming and subscribing to my channel?

THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR 330 SUBS AH ILY ALL IM SO SO GRATEFUL",2017-07-09T15:56:29Z,93401,3035056,4136,"hello guys, it's Emma... today I'm back with another video...you know the drill. Today's video probably already saw the title okay, whatever um today's video, I'm going to be reacting to some of my extremely embarrassing pictures from when I was a younger child. Human. basically, I have this like nice little ugly phase from like eight to like now um no I mean well yes, but like especially just not you know a really yeah, we'll just say like 8 to 12 like that span of age actually honestly who am I kidding like I've just been embarrassing my whole life so we're going to be looking at the photos from the awkward stages of my life, which is My whole entire life, but whatever. I'm just gonna be reacting to them talking about them I don't know We'll see what happens...I think this will be entertaining considering these photos are actually horrible like they are so Oh my God like I don't think I've ever cringed harder in my entire life so maybe this video can double as like a try not to cringe challenge or something but You can play that with yourself. Okay let's begin by the way all these photos are from my mom's Facebook page so like these are no joke like Accessible which just makes this 10 times worse like that anybody can see these who's friends with my mom on Facebook Like my mom has like a sh-crap ton of freaking Facebook friends and all of them can see these pictures I'm actually going to start you out with as little a little cute photo of me from when I was a baby *yaaaay* just sitting in a box Well now that I warmed you up um It's going to get a lot worse from here so buckle your seatbelt buddy cuz yeah, so like yeah I was kind of cute when I was little but then I also had things that things that happen like this oOF I'm looking at my computer my ~compooter~ Looking at my kid-pooter Over here. I'm at the picture of me so as you can see I have these sexy glasses on just man I'm pretty sure they were my grandma's. see i have his book on my head because obviously I was reading umm a romance novel What's new right? I mean, you know...it's where I get all of my romance tricks um as you see if you zoom in on the book on my head There's some people just casually making love on the book and I had no clue when I was like eight years old What was going on in the book um if I would have known I probably would have been scarred for the rest of my life But... but um yeah just sitting there with my ariel velour sweatshirt You know living my best life it was great. I don't even know what else to say about that one ummm I was just a savage basically okayy next oH GoD There's like not one thing about this photo that is like not actually horrible like every aspect of this photo is horrible. double oof.... ohhkay... I don't know where to start. I don't even know where to start I guess we can start with my shirt I mean, it's a lafitte in the room. I'm wearing a fRED shirt Where did I buy it from? I bought it from Justice. Can this get any worse? I don't know okay my hat and scarf just don't match any element of that outfit whatsoever was it cold out? Probably not. I'm just And you can just like see the little outline of my like Justice cami underneath, and that's just horrible And then I'm sticking my tongue out like ""oh my God. I'm wearing the dopest outfit right now like fff*** with me like"" it'sss not good. I mean at least No, there's nothing good about this like... and ESPECIALLY this fred shirt. If you liked fred that was okay if that doesn't proves to you guys that I am an og like YouTube user like Fred was like so like long ago that like that was when it all began. Oh my God. I miss those days I loved fred I was in love with him, okay Whatever anyway, fred if you're watching this-no I'm just kidding that's a joke But yeah, he's like the og YouTuber like he was the og like comedy like funny guy i dont know....whatever Moving on I don't want to look at that photo ever again to be honest. Next I'm just hitting you guys left and right with these cringy photos so I mean it's Halloween. I'm like what?? s--- five I don't know. I mean. I'm a witch okay from the movie Bewitched or whatever I don't even know what that movie is Is that even what it is? Bewitched? Yeah. I guess as you can see by that just huge Grin on my face I am revving up to get some mad candy up in here like Kit Kats galore kiss cats-  kits kats- God I can't talk. Kit Kats Galore, Reese's, Hershey's, I don't freaking know crunch bars like Jolly Ranchers like hook me up like I was ready I was about to like... go out there You know when like people leave out a bowl of candy, and they just say like take one Well with that kind of face. You know I wasn't just going to take one I was going to take like ten because I'm a freaking rebel My dress is just I mean the cheapest form of velvet I mean or not even velvet Whatever that is That's just like the cheapest material you could buy the costume barely fit me it was like way too big I don't know It's a mess, okay But just when you think this photo can get worse like my face is cringing enough like just the outfit in general Just doesn't look great like I'm basically a mess, but like just when you think it couldn't get worse look at my shoes What are those????? What are those? okay I'm sorry at the time I did swim like I was doing like swimming at like a little Place and apparently I had swim practice before this because I was wearing my Speedo slides, I Mean I guess I was like before the trend because now like those Fenty who must slides or you know what I'm talking about the fluffy ones, whatever those are Super Trendy so I guess I was just I guess that's just a little bit early, but this one is horrible and Literally, I cannot believe that. I wore those shoes with that. How was that I had no like idea How like bad my fashion sense was it was absolute trash so anyway. That's that we need to move on I literally can't look at this photo anymore. It's horrible alright now Obviously that was one of the halloween costumes that I didn't really you know wasn't my best my best But from there it gets better um this next one. I'm a little bit younger I don't know. I'm but I'm dressed up as a cat And the thing is about this is that you might think oh that's from Halloween. No that's not from Halloween I love that cat suit so much that I wore it all the time Halloween I don't even think I wore it on Halloween. I would just wear it around the house because I thought it was so cool It's so freaking loud, Jesusí a slack Hat Suit was this was not a halloween costume like I do just kind of one of my son outfits You know for just like a casual day out anyway Because I was having the best time like just I'm gonna look at my face I am having the time of my fricking life like this is literally I've never been happier than I was in that friggin cat suit so I mean I'm not complaining I think it was overall great time but okay. This is embarrassing. I mean not really embarrassing. It's more. Just like okay She would be better if I didn't wear that cat suit like outside of like appropriate time to wear a cat suit Continuing on okay this next one honestly I don't even know there's two of these from the same time or from the same like day Or same like I don't even know the first one I'm just I'm just hitting you with that Frickin look at Kylie Jenner like lip pop out like just like a puffing my lips out look like I'm a freaking like selfie queen or something. I don't know um little did. I know that like one day That would be like a selfie pose that like celebrities do oh my God so before my time Yeah, this is really horrible as you can see by my giants jacket funny story behind the Giants jacket I actually didn't know anything about baseball sports. I just don't know anything about that kind of stuff I just bought that jacket cuz them it was like sports day at my school And so I was like oh like I really need a giant jacket can all the other kids at my school Like they know everything about sports not know anything like please like help me out here, so yeah So I got that I wasn't even like a real fan. So that's embarrassing I guess it was crazy hair day at school That's what I'm in assume I mean like what kind of face am I making like I just don't understand like I can't even recreate that like there's no way That I could even like I don't even know I don't name in them I have nothing else to say just when you think it couldn't any worse. There's another one Like you know your parents like oh, hey, like hey I'm not posed for a picture And then this is what I do like what we're doing like revving up to like fight someone I don't understand any element of this photo. I don't get it. Just disappointed in myself. I'm just disappointed. I'm I'm angry I'm I thought I was better than that you know I thought it was better than that, but apparently I wasn't and I think we need to move on we've explored this Whatever, this is enough Let's move on so the next few photos are from a trip that I went on when I went to Ireland with my mom So first picture, okay? I'm pretty sure this was what I was in Dublin Ireland I am irish by the way I basically was just really connecting with my roots as you can see I'm in some Sort of church chapel thing which is cool. You know um yeah, I'm just really finding myself You know yeah, I'm sitting on a chair just being a tourist you know what I am posing Just writing in a little notebook with my quill I don't know if you can tell but actually if you zoom in a little bit closer. I'm not actually writing on anything I'm actually fake writing on my hand That is so cool. Talk about freaking ImprOV modeling Just like kind of like winging it But just like really turning it into my own thing like just kind of like making it my own just kind of like ooh How should you post for this photo? well You're holding a quill so what better thing to do then fake write on your hand that is so cool my thoughts exactly So yeah, I'm just fake writing on my hand really focused just really like just really writing down my feelings in my diary I mean, I can just imagine myself being like Yeah, that's about it. So anyway. That was that was that Who's surprised my outfit is actually horrible like my outfit Just sucks like there's no way to like sugarcoat. It like my outfit is horrible, and there's no good part about it Okay moving on to next Ireland photo as You can see the giants jacket has resurfaced and my legs are no joke one inch long one inch One inch long my legs are non-existent. They are no joke this big okay? I? Don't even know what to say about the photo. I'm like trying to smile I'm like trying to pose, but like the wind is just overtaking me, and I'm just like giving up I'm just looking out like this is it. I'm just going to stand here in my Huge Giants jacket with my really like not my size jeans But you know and I slept like a stubby little stick like I was like a little like wine cork like I don't even know what I was I just like it anybody who doubted that I had like a really bad face like my whole life has been like a She's not looking so good face But like this was like the worst day like I don't think it's gotten worse And then how it is in this exact photo like this was my absolute Low point like I have never looked worse in my life But I mean you know what I was living my best life I had no clue how ugly I was and so who cares right? I think that's all there is to explore about this photo I mean like if you zoom in closer. I'm like trying to smile, but I'm just dying inside I'm like oh, God like I'm so done with this tortoise life like I've been in Ireland for like a solid three days And I'm just over in it for this. I'm like Frickin 10. I just want to go and play my DX anyway next Ireland photo Just when you thought my fashion sense couldn't get worse. Oh my God it gets worse it gets much much much worse Oh my God, it like my face in my smile I look like a bunny rabbit like an obese bunny like that's literally all I can describe. I'm wearing a nice little Justice peace sign Hoodie, okay, fair enough. I mean, whatever I was like ten, so I guess I'll like cut myself some flack for that But the chains okay, I'm wearing them again. I've worn these in like multiple photos They were obviously my favorite jeans design but Don't really know why they are my favorite because they just didn't fit me like they just want to not my size like simply not My size obviously this outfit sucks. My pose is just corny I look like a bunny, and you can't even see my face like I don't even know what my emotion was in this photo I basically looked like Just not good. Which is when you think this outfit can get worse. I'm wearing black ballet flats with this outfit Now I think if I was at this age It would have been logical for me to wear something like vans or converse or I don't know anything, but ballet flats What were they thinking? What was italy? What was I thinking on? I barely liked ballet flats at the time as it was I was being a tourist I was walking around like Castles and stuff as you can see in the photo I'm like buy a castle or something and I chose to wear ballet flats on a day that I would be walking around Multiple miles, and I chose to wear ballet flats. I like they just don't mess outfit whatsoever They are so ugly and I I don't understand what my what I was doing I did I I know like I don't get it I don't understand what meant through my mind like I can't even Express to you like how lost I am just trying to understand and put myself in my own shoes literally I don't even know where to start I can't I can't even start all I can do is end I just can't even talk about this anymore I hope you I hope you're ok after seeing that like I I'm not I got okay like I'm not at all okay But I think you will be hopefully just be thankful that that wasn't you okay? That's all the advice. I have this next one I'm trying to be cute in front of this like Little church thing you know just Me slaying in Ireland the usUal, okay? This is a completely different day when I'm wearing an outfit that I probably already worn like four times over the course of the trip, but if you zoom into my face, I Look like somebody who's like skydiving. They're like falling through the sky at like an alarming rate in their faces Just like completely distorted and my strained and just like uncomfortable that's exactly what I look like in this photo I look horrible per usual, but I mean you know. I'm not going to be so hard to make up I'm being too hard on myself. You know. It's just I was ten right, so that's my excuse is that I was ten But the thing that makes me cringe the worst is that I haven't been to europe since this like This trip to Ireland and like uh now Knowing like how cool the time talking alright But it's now that I'm older like I know how cool Ireland would be to go to now and I just like in like Cringing at every one of these photos because I'm like oh my God like I would be able to take the dopest photos Now that I'm like older in this location You know like but but at the time I was just my style was horrible everything about me was just so rough um just really rough and so Basically that shows in these photos But it makes me cringe because I'm like okay if I could redo this now. It would be so cool Whatever continuing on there was no what to say about that one. I think this pretty self-explanatory To finish off this video strong this picture really isn't embarrassing. I thought it was funny, and I wanted to include it This last photo is a photo of me sitting on the toilet at night um just taking a big old Just what I'm doing. I don't know how else to explain it I must have been having tummy troubles because my mom is sitting there with me I guess my dad must been taking the photo it Just must have been quite an ordeal because it's like obviously late at night and like everybody's just sitting around me while I'm taking this message And I just like I don't know um so that's interesting I used to suck my thumb when I was little as you can tell And I have my favorite blanket with me I will not say its name because I named the blanket, but I will not be saying its name in this video because um Why would I do that to myself you know that's just torture basically you know the reason why I put this in this video Was not because it's embarrassing because honestly this was not embarrassing I think it's more just funny and amusing more than anything But the American part of that about this is actually what my mom's Facebook caption was with this photo for caption for her Facebook post for this photo was After midnight, Poopoo. Oh yeah after midnight, poopoo That's all That's it fallout. So I have for you today. That's it all you get I hope you enjoyed this video I hope that you just like learn from my mistakes like for example Don't ever wear ballet flats with jeans and well I mean, I guess you could but just don't do it the way I did it try to buy clothes that fit you you know that's another thing um I don't know just try not to do what I did because as you can see looking at these photos as a older person I'm now 16 half these photos were like five Seven years ago some of them were even like 10 years ago some of them were even like total home were even like 12 years Ago who knows they were just okay looking back I am so just I'm not embarrassed because I'm proud of how far. I've come I think that I've definitely Evolved as a human and I don't think I'm as that cringey anymore Honestly, I probably am but I don't know I'm just I can hope and pray to the universe that I am not like that anymore But overall the story is um embrace your past and make a youtube video about it I don't know. I don't know how to even conclude this video.

couldn't read because I decided to use blue ink which is like kinda hard to see but it says hey guys so then we're all this story is hey guys I'm back another video today I'm gonna be doing a really weird video I'm gonna be doing the yoga challenge I guess but it's a little bit different because number one I'm alone now you be like well how does that work because you don't have like somebody to do the acro tricks with no like well I'm not doing a crowd tricks I'm doing like yoga that like one person can do okay that's embarrassing as you can see by the intro of this I know how to do some yoga like I can do that like headstand thing you know I was like pretty flexible back in the day to competitive cheer and so I could do the splits and I was pretty I was pretty flexible actually I'll instruct some pictures right here I was pretty flexible those days are over I got like a back injury at one time basically I just do not bend like that anymore so trying to do these yoga poses is going to be extremely difficult and hopefully entertaining because I'm going to fail like really really badly I've stretched before this video ow ow I'm done with that I shirts before this video and um so basically ready so I chose a few yoga poses from Pinterest I just searched advanced advanced yoga poses then I could try and I wanted to make them a little bit difficult but maybe they're doable so I don't know maybe I'll be the newest yoga master so we'll find out let's get started the first yoga pose I'll insert a picture so you know what it looks like looks like she has her leg like this and the other one is fine her like this oh god this is already going back like this and she's grabbing her leg oh no oh god no I stretched out okay this is just oh no okay this is as good as it's gonna get wait where what a rough start I'm moving on moving on it'll be better at the next one all right anything I can do this one so I don't really know how she got into this position but we're just gonna see what we can do she's kind of like I will take her ladylike balancing on her shoulders so maybe if I start like that oh okay I'm just gonna I think um I think it's gonna scratch that one yeah it's a little bit too easy for me and don't really want to waste my time with easy ones like that so I'm just gonna move on okay this next one yeah I think this one will be probably the easiest ones of her looks like she has her leg arm like this and then oh god actually aim to do this way okay this dragon dragon I'm suturing it I can't keep giving up you know give me ups for losers all right I'm not I'm not a loser I'm a winner okay I'm winner I think oh all right I definitely nailed that one that one man I nailed it right on the head zero flaws perfect yoga master okay moving on next one this one seems kind of fun like this one doesn't seem too hard she's kind of in a crisscross the applesauce sort of thing going and she's like this I've got oh I'm gonna just hit my knuckles on the floor okay trying against wat me why is this so hard woman okay this one's like really hard for some reason and Wow okay Oh God I think that one went all right I think I don't think I nailed it but I think I like did all right I think any good enough good enough next one I don't even know to say about this one I'm just gonna frickin try it alright so she's like this oh one more try I'm just gonna freakin go up with all power Ave oh god the yoga life is no joke just not for me okay next it's just not gonna happen but we can try okay well actually to redeem myself because um so brother's video has been quite a fail I'll show you one of my cool yoga tricks so that you don't think I'm too much of a loser oh wow I am a yoga master okay this one out I'm supposed to like grab my foot oh my god no ah no how did she get her foot back there okay this is as good as it's gonna get ha you see my toes on the wood why did I keep having me well that one was a fail but at least you got to see me do a handstand oh wow and that's kind of cool right I'm not that bad right Wow next this one doesn't seem too hard like I feel like I can do this she cut her arms last try last try um nailed it now last but not least Miley Cyrus is doing this pose and like I don't know like I feel like I don't think of her as like a yoga master so I feel like if she can do it I can do it right right okay I'm gonna try oh I almost have it this is really hard yoga's hard anybody who ever hates on yoga don't bash it till you try it buddy oh I think I'm gonna get it OH oh I got it I don't even need to do it again you saw it you just witness that I'm a yoga master that was the best thing I've ever done in my entire life in my entire yoga career besides my hand headstand thing that I know how to do that's pretty cool too but like this is better anyway that was today's video hope it's still filming it's still filming yes thank God okay no sales video I'm just sweating a little bit I hope you enjoyed if you did give this video a thumbs up for my horrible yoga skills honestly yoga's way harder than I thought like I didn't even think it was gonna be that hard I was like oh yeah he'll get at least one I did not get any but I guess that's what happens when you search advanced yoga I mean I'm very much not an advanced so anyway that's all for today if you enjoyed this video as I said earlier give it a

PFLcXwSzZh0,OBSESSED AF,"thanks for stoppin by, hope you enjoyed:) i plan on uploading 1+ times per week, so subscribe to be notified when I post a new video!! 

In this video I show all of the products, drinks/foods, beauty products, technology items, AND MORE that I am obsessed with at the moment.  Basically a bunch of random stuff that I love…

THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR 200 SUBSCRIBERS!!!! IT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME AND ITS SO DOPE!!!! I APPRECIATE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF U",2017-07-06T16:34:04Z,25441,639674,833,"Hello guys, today I'm back with another video and today. I'm going to be showing you my current obsessions, so Basically this video is just going to be showing you everything that I'm obsessed with basically anything like there's not really one Specific like genre of things that I'm like obsessed with right now. It's basically just everything and it's pretty random I don't know. I don't really know this video is really random, but we're just going to go with it Let's get into what I'm obsessed with to begin of course. I'm gonna start with food/ Drinks, so if you've been watching my videos for a while Well, I mean, I've only been doing YouTube videos for like a month If you've watched some my videos then you might have heard me talking about my legendary strawberry Lemon smoothie So that's my first obsession right now. I have one right here It's so good basically what's in it is Strawberries frozen they have to be frozen a little bit of lemon juice and water And then you blend it up in terms into a slushie. I'm so nasally right now. Oh my gosh I sound like a basic Youtuber or like every single Youtuber starts out their video by saying how they're sick And how like they're sorry that they sound nasally or whatever because they're sick, okay? Whatever what I'm not going to be like that alright. You deal with my nasalyness, or else Just kidding. I'm sorry. So that's my first obsession It's great and very refreshing for the summer time okay, whatever next literally is like everybody in La drinks these but like I don't live in La so I Maybe I'm not supposed to drink these But my next favorite is the La Croix But I'm not just talking about like any La Croix because I know there's like a bunch different flavors And I've actually had those before too But my favorite kind of La Croix is just the pure one I guess any sparkling water would do But this one's like just cool because like the bottle looks cool and because everybody in La drinks La Croix So I just felt like it would be cooler if I got the you know sparkling water That was La Croix brand because I'm just trying to be cool cool you- Public service announcement if you want to be cool don't ever do that with your fingers, okay ever? -tuber you know anyway, but yeah, so just but I like to like one with no flavor, and then I add I squeeze lime into it Good stuff any kind of club soda sparkling water with lime But I'm just being extra those are my only like food favorites or drink favorites I guess those were both drinks. Those are not food next. I'm going to kind of like accessories I guess that I was really digging first was like colored sunglasses Like these basically sun glasses that are like have colored lenses these are just a few these ow Wow, these I just picked these up, and they're super cool and These I have a few more those aren't my only ones, but those are some of my faves Yeah, basically just like colored lens glasses. I think they're really cool. I think they're really fun I think they're kind of will spice up an outfit. I've been obsessed with those lately. They especially look good in pics Which is of course important next next fashion style accessory favorite was this this Shell choker um thumbs this video up if you think  this shark tooth necklace is extra. I Think it's extra too, but I don't know something about it Just summer vibes so I mean I'm digging it a little bit, but I also like this Shell necklace, I think it's really cute I think it's kind of like it really just brings in the right vibe like I just think it's the best kind of vibe So yeah, the shell necklace has been something I've definitely been obsessed with next is this because I just got my license And so I'm not going to show it because I look Frickin horrible in it, but I keep my license in here I would literally show it, but I just oh God I look horrible in it, so yes And actually care of my license all the time Yeah, this has been coming in handy a lot. I also can put my car keys in it It's great, but this leads me into my next thing because in this little pouch I also like to hold this which is my first technology obsession. Okay, if you don't know what to say as well This isn't even an obsession. This is just a necessity. This is what connects me to the Holy aux Cord because I've got I phone 7 and if you know anything about the new apple products you need adapters for Everything because they only have like one hole in it, and so there's like you'll just get a bunch of different adapters so that it can all connect. I don't know it's really frustrating I love how they're trying to simplify stuff, but like this is getting a little bit annoying Yeah, this is just one of the adapters for the iphone anyways, basically Shove this into the power Cord thing and then this is where you can connect the aux headphones Whatever it is So crucial definitely one of my have sessions, and if I want to like you know I don't know. I always put this in here, so They're like bfFs. I guess next has been Driving because I got my license whatever okay driving is so fun. These are my keys ok cool, oh wait well, not my keys, but whatever I'm driving is so fun You feel so free you feel so wild yeah Basically like the best form of freedom and I've been driving around a lot if you watch my vlogs You know I've been driving a lot and yeah, so fun I love to just like I'll do just random stuff like if I'm bored I'll to go out and drive somewhere because why not right next has been this Out why do that? I just don't mind at that um it's basically. It's called a gorillapod I think as I was well, I don't know anyway But I got this actually kind of a while ago um And I used it a little bit then but now that I actually make youtube videos I've been using this a lot So basically it's like kind of like this little thing where you can just shove your phone I don't know my phone is right now anyway You're going to shove your phone in here And then like bend these things around so you can basically prop your phone up anywhere And it's just like a little mini tripod You could also put a camera on the end of this too if you wanted But I haven't done that but you can so this is perfect for vlogs and especially car vlogs This is great is you can just set up your phone and just talk to yourself? To your phone yourself you know yeah, so that's been really handy Especially now that on me and all I got hardcore Youtuber just like youtubing left and right no big deal you know Okay next ponds now. Oh my God. I've got this kind of recently because all my friends are raving about it And they're like Emma ponds like it's so awesome I would basically just late to the bandwagon like everybody else have this and I just like I don't know it's never got it because I'm kind of lazy when it comes to skin stuff as you can probably tell by my pimple of everywhere But um yeah my skin kind of sucks, but because I'm just so lazy and there's so many products And I don't know argh and ok whatever it's not into that stuff, but pause is great It makes my face feel so much more Smooth and like when I wake up in the morning my face doesn't like look as dry, and I think you can like oh It's saying it even on the back says it like won't clog pores which is something that's Important because like a lot of moisturizers and stuff will kind of like make your skin more oily and stuff like that But this one doesn't do that. So this is great. I really like it. It's great I've never met someone who does not like ponds um next products Lovington because if anybody knows anything about me I love to be tan recently I went on a vacation to the Dominican Republic if you also watch my vlogs you would know that and it was great It was great time but before I left I wasn't very tan I was pretty pale And I was like stressing out because I was like for the first few days before I get a tan on the B pale So I need to do something about it. So I used loving pan I also I have other tanning products that I also enjoy But this is just the one that I've been using recently. It's kind of expensive. I also like the jergens mousse Journey I also like the jergens mousse so both are good But this holds really this one is really good really good quality. It actually expired in like April, but I'm still using it. Haha savage Anyway, if I get like a weird rash or something that's probably why although fun fact about me I like to keep a chapstick by my bed at all times because I don't know whenever I'm in bed I just feel like wow my lips are really dry right now And I could really go from some my lips are really dry right now And I could really go for some Oh my God my lips are really dry And I could really go for some Chapstick right now there it is the one that's been by my bed lately is The Nivea lip butter a raspberry rose a kiss okay. Let me just tell you I'm kind of a chapstick conducer I love Chapstick. I don't know just makes me happy this one smells Actually, so good like oh my I literally can't The only thing about this is that it kind of makes your lips turn like a little bit light like white like it's not like a well you know almost chapstick like Transparent like you can't tell it like somebody's wearing it and so I'm kind of like makes your lips look really  white does that make sense Besides that I love it it makes my lips super soft, and you smell so good So I'm really I'm really obsessed with that my next obsession is not a tangible thing But it's kind of something that I'm obsessed with I've really been liking waking up early I feel like I don't know during the summer I really like I a lot of people will just like sleep a lot and stuff like that And I like want to do that But like I feel like I just wasted my whole day if I wake up at like 11:00 So lately I've been waking up at like 6:15 sometimes 7:30 Sometimes 8:15 like whatever basically what I'm trying to say is I just have been waking up early lately And I dig it, so I think my last obsession that I'm currently having what does that mean? basically my last obsession for today and YouTube now that might seem a little bit weird, but uh yeah I basically recently started YouTube probably I think is about a little bit a little bit like maybe two days um Like I think I started youtube about a month ago, and um I love it. I'm kind of obsessed with it I'm not going to Lie. It's pretty addictive I posted almost every day since I started which is weird because most people don't really do that But I don't know I just I love it. I think it's so fun I'm kind of trying to figure out What I want to do with my channel, and what my channel even is I think this whole process is so fun? I really like it so far. I think that starting YouTube has been a great decision and I like it I'm definitely obsessed with it. So if you've subscribed in this past month I Appreciate you. I love you. Well that's kind of weird. Now is it weird I don't know What kind of intimate but anyway, I appreciate the crap out of you and it means a lot to me But I'm not going to get sappy in here these crying is for weenies. Just kidding I cry all the time anyway, but yeah, I hope you enjoyed this video That's everything I'm obsessed with but obviously my favorite obsession is Youtube but like whatever the to do was really random, but I mean Maybe is interesting if it was give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel if you like me and yeah Comment down below anything you want say hi, say bye I don't care actually I always say don't care, but I do care like if you I want you to comment But I mean like I don't care about like what you say, but like you know I do care I want you to comment because I love you. Why do I keep saying? I love you like is that weird like I don't know I feel like other youtubers say that they love their subscribers But I feel like that weird I Don't know I'll figure that out. I'll see that's like so acceptable whatever anyway. I'll see you next time peace"

I'm going to be doing a little bit of a different kind of video something I normally don't do and It's because it regards makeup now. I wear makeup, but I did but I just don't wear it my videos. Why you may ask Honestly because I'm lazy and I want to be able to film on the fly like if I'm like if I get an idea I wanted to be able to Film and if I actually do all my makeup and like do my hair all nice and all that stuff Honestly that just kind of like messes up my creative process. I'm not somebody who's I'm a simple Gal You know I'll wear makeup. If it's necessary. I can do my makeup like I know how I'm not great at it I'm not like a pro I do that. I do the very necessities like you know, and I'll do highlight. I'll have a little bit of fun You know but yeah, I'm not a huge girl on makeup I'm more about kind of fashion clothes that kind of girl, but despite all of this today. I'm going to be Trying to do my eyebrows for the first time now my eyebrows They're pretty much a mess um they're not like on fleek. You know. I mean I do get my eyebrows on sometimes, but honestly I just like don't care about them enough to like get them done like as often as they probably should honestly I'm really lazy And I never like fill them in or anything because I just like that's just kind of a part of makeup that I just neglect like I just never Got onto that trend which I mean some people would argue is like absolutely horrible And I should probably get on that right now, or outside. You know dye Probably what better thing to do then try to do my eyebrows for the first time on camera and if you're here for a tutorial um I Can tell you that this video will not help you if you want to learn how to do your eyebrows because I have no clue What I'm doing to start out this video I'm going to actually go online and google how to do your eyebrows and find like a little diagram on Pinterest or something that I could follow along with so that I could you know Do my eyebrows not completely blindly because I actually have no clue what to do like I don't even know how to start searched how to do your eyebrows and I found this Little diagram that will help me in this process got on here the first step you I'm breaking out by the way so like my skin looks a little bit nasty But you know gotta do what you got to do first. It says to take a spoolie, so I got one this little thing And you're watching Disney channel Anyway, first. It's just to brush out your eyebrows, so I'm gonna brush them out I don't really know I mean I guess I've done this before like I've actually brushed out like okay I'm just doing the close. I've actually brushed them out both in my past before because They were just looking a little bit wild so this step is actually not something I can't do I actually think I can do this step This is probably the easiest step and after this things are going to get a little bit out of hand also Like my eyebrows are not Done right now like like the bottom like i don't know if you can see but I like a bunch of like Eyebrow hairs that are just down here like my eyebrows are not plucked or waxed. They're not threaded They're just like wild right now, and I'm just like I haven't done anything to fix it So that is going to kind of make this whole entire situation a little bit more difficult But we're going to work with what we got okay, so the first step was to brush out your eyebrows So I think I did that all right? Okay, wait. Nope. I didn't Okay, they're brushed now or at least good enough second step Draw a clean line under your brow Okay, so it looks like in this tutorial They're using like an angled brush like this like a little angled oh my God Brb Beauty guru angled Brush Okay, anyway, so I have an angled brush, so I should have multiple, and I don't know this one would be the best i have like this one and this one This one seems a little bit thicker, so I'm not going to use this one and then this one That comes with the spoolie thing on the end, so I don't know which one's the best one to use I'm thinking this one So i'm gonna use this one okay, so how do we figure that out draw a clean line under your brow, so I have this Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit Light to medium okay. Whatever. This is like. This is definitely my favorite contour kit, but I don't know it about makeup So what does that mean to anybody nothing um but I guess it says to find like a shade of Brown That's like kind of close to your eyebrow and like I don't even know what color my eyebrow is so like I have these like three brown colors on the bottom and I Think you're supposed to use like eyebrow like actual eyebrow like stuff, but like I don't have that so I'm just using this um So like I'm gonna use one of these I don't know which one. I'm going to use yet though I'm just going to kind of wing it. I don't know Let me like I'm literally going to hold this up to my eyebrow and see which one looks this looks the most similar um Okay, literally none of them look similar at all Okay, well I'm still going to figure this out okay, so I think I'm just going to use this middle one honestly I think it might be way too light But like I don't really care um let's get started so first it says to draw a line under your brow a clean line Okay, well that's a lot to ask. I'm just drawing a line under my eyebrow Oh My God, that's a lot of oh wait That's just not at all the right color oh my god I don't know if you can see this I don't know if you can see this right here But that is not at all the right color so I need to try this again with a different color Okay, update. I don't feel that the Anastasia Anasazi Anasazi Anastasia Anastasia okay. I don't feel like that Palette was really doing its job It didn't have the right color so I just brought out my coastal scents Warm Palette that I got in like a no-joke fifth grade and I thought it was the coolest thing ever because Everybody wanted coastal scents because it was like what all of the cool beauty gurus had back in the time anyways That's when I thought that I was going to be good at makeup Newsflash a Few years later, and I still suck so okay So I'm just going to try to find a color that would match my eyebrow. I have like no clue What color would match like I don't know if I should do a darker one or okay? I think I found one I'm just honestly at this point. I'm just going to wing it. I chose this one right here. I even know clue okay That's probably like a really bad decision It's probably too dark, but like dark brows are like totally in right now, so I'm just going to go with it Maybe you should use this one okay I'm gonna use this one. Okay? Which one did I even choose I don't know anymore. So let's try this again so draw a line under your brow Okay, this color is definitely better, but it's still bad It said a clean line and so far things aren't going so well, but oh this is like. Maybe a little bit too brown Okay That looks about oh my God, that's horrible It's honestly It's ten times worse because my eyebrows like aren't done right now like I literally do need to get my brows done Every time I get my brows done I break out and like I get like a bunch of so I don't like want to get them done right now I'm just going to continue and see if this works Maybe this will fix all my problems, okay next next is just repeat on the top of brow, so we've had to do that I don't know which color I used but whatever I'm just going to use a random one I'm actually going to darken up the one on the bottom because I feel like it wasn't good enough. Oh, God That's really bad, okay. Well, you know what Don't feel like anything's coming off with okay continuing um Okay, if you're looking like drawing too far out from my brow like I'm not like okay So now I have this line around my entire eyebrow And it basically just looks like I have a big fat eyebrow like it has no shape Because it just has no shape like I don't know if you can tell okay bad very bad very bad Okay, so now just to fill in brow lightly so I don't know I'm filling up my little brush thing again with like every color in that Basic area of the color that I originally show because I can't remember which one I originally chose but now's it's a fill-in brow in Sparse areas I Okay, this little area looks kind of Sparse I guess, huh do you like fill? This in like okay? Wait? Oh? I see oh my God this looks so bad. It looks like a Okay, I'm kind of figuring it out, but it still looks horrible I look like a drag queen like I look like an actual drag queen Okay That looks act actually freaking really bad, okay um Why does over here have a no-joke like an actually? What even it does this look like what it even is that? Like what even does that look like I can't I like have no words I don't even know this doesn't look remotely like an eyebrow like it looks something like this looks like a freaking like a Capsized boat like it just looks like an upSide-down boat Or like a really like really overweight squirrel But like that's all I have like Horrible, but I'm not going to give up yet. I'm going to continue with the tutorial and see if I can maybe Fix it. I don't know. I think it's too far gone. I think it's too far gone, but I'm gonna keep trying Now it is to brush out brow lightly to get rid of excess product Yeah, I don't think that's the problem. I think I need to brush this so that I can get rid of excess Freaking brow hairs because that it's so ungroomed that actually No, it doesn't look good for a second i thought it looked good, and it it didn't and I look kind of like Lindsay Lohan or something. I don't it's No offense to you Lindsay you probably Know how to do your eyebrows better than me at least your makeup artist does I don't know hey it continuing so I just brushed out all the Excess my eyebrows are freaking sick af right now use a light concealer to sharpen and give clean finish, okay? I didn't even know this wasn't set But I'm down um Because I think this really needs help Honestly, I might have to put concealer over my hair which I think is just not allowed But I don't even care because it's when I'm really desperate okay, so I'm going to take out a concealer I'm going to be using okay this concealer. Which is the Covergirl ready set gorgeous, okay? I'd like a hundred different Concealers, and I just use different ones every time because I don't know which one I like um Because I do my makeup like once a year so okay, It says to put it on a brush, okay. I'll do that fine Okay, so I have this other angled brush, and I'm just going to put some concealer on it Is that even allowed I don't know alright It's like basically filled up wait Okay, um now. I have to like draw a line under my brow okay um, okay update I'm like putting it over my hair because I Just think that that needs to okay. Why is that turning that color that just does not look right at all Okay, this is really going turning bad turning bad, but we're about to fix this Okay, update. I put a lot more concealer on my brush this time So I think this might be able to help salvage salvage the issue Okay, I'm continuing on now. Oh that's a lot more okay. Okay. Sorry if that wasn't in focus whole time honestly I just it's probably better that it wasn't even in focus because this is like actually a mess so update I do have some on my hair eyebrow hair. Oh my God. You can like tell, okay that's really bad and then after it says repeat on your upper brow on the upper part of your brow, okay that Does it looks better? It's still horrible, but it's better. I'm gonna do the upper brow now This is looking better now that I've covered like the excess parts of my hair down below But like it's still bad so like I don't I don't know I'm kind of having mixed emotions I think the online tutorial had good intentions, but so far it hasn't really helped me But I think we're going to figure this out. So now it says to repeat on your upper brow oh God now sick in my hair, okay Okay, this is actually kind of fun. I feel like I'm just doing like an art project on my face my God Okay, I'm just going to do a little bit on this side - why fricking not why not just I outline the whole entire brow You know like oh This could be like a halloween costume. I don't know what I'd be dressed up as but it would be fun, okay? So here's where we are now basically just like an outlined eyebrow Mm. Okay, it kinda doesn't look that bad Who am I kidding it looks freaking horrible? Now just to blend it out with your finger So this is when things are going to get bad did I wash my hands before this video. No oh my God Why is this exactly like finger paint when I was in preschool like why is there no difference? kind of disturbing, but whatever we not have just this whole entire cloud of like white around my brow like it's just I think I used too much concealer to be honest but eww oh my god my skin like looks discolored. okay actually. This doesn't look that bad no, okay? I keep trying to tell myself that it doesn't look that bad And it really does it really looks bad and like I don't know if you can like see this right here But like yours like it's just like a my hair. They're just covered in like Concealer and it looks horrible, because I'm an idiot and I don't get my eyebrows done Which I need to do because now I'm getting self-conscious, and I feel like I'm not on trend and excuse my disgusting skin, okay? I know, it's bad. Don't roast me in the comments, please I beg Of you anyway, but yes, this is really bad um I tried though I really did I tried I give myself an a-plus for effort You know I do okay, so that's the end of this video. I don't know how I really look right now I think after I've rubbed out the concealer doesn't look as bad, but it doesn't look great. You know let me look Yeah, it just looks horrible What doesn't even look like anything happened really actually and now I can just tell more how like Unruly my eyebrows are I'd say overall this was a fail I'd say if I got my eyebrows done it might be better, but the current state that my eyebrows are at right now Just was uh setting me up for failure when it came to Trying to do my eyebrows I hope you enjoyed this video if you did give it a big thumbs up subscribe to my channel comment down below anything you want Anything that your heart desires.

I'm from California the bay area to be exact. what do I do for a living? nothing ev- nothing what is your favorite color? okay. this is like a loaded question I really- i like a bunch of different colors for a bunch of different reasons, so i don't have an answer, but i like all colors um yea as long as they match to my aesthetic, you know.. just kidding um what is your star sign? my star sign is a gemini it actually, literally, I am such my sign like every aspect of a Gemini is me: like talking too much, That's basically it favorite music genre. I don't really know I know which ones. I don't like I don't really like Pop music I'm not the biggest country music fans, but I like you know alternative kind of Indie stuff You know get the like hipsters well um who is your favorite musician? So I like a bunch of different musicians like if you're talking about like I like 50s music I like 70s and 80s music so like with 50s I like Doris Day and Bobby Vinton when it comes to 70s and 80s music I like Elton John the beatles like I don't even know like like a bunch of different stuff But like recent artists like new or artists I like real-estate beach house Matt Demarco Love Matt Marco, Taemin Paula The strokes let me go to my spotify right now two L's later sweet foxes two door cinema club vampire weekend I like Beach fossils okay. I like a lot of artists, but those are just a few of them favorite food Honestly it kind of changes all the time. I do really love sushi, but I'm vegetarian so like veggie sushi. Yeah I'm like a fake sushi fans, but whatever I like to smoothies favorite drink, okay? three number one My strawberry Smoothie that I make that's just strawberries lemon juice and water and then blend it up And it turns into a slushie really good another thing I like It's sparkling water with lime squeezed into it really good Then last not least my favorite drink of all time iced almond milk latte It's not decaf tea cap is for weenies. No skidding subject, okay favorite Snack I? Feel like I eat a bunch of small Snacks throughout the day like I never eat like a big meal I just eat snacks honestly. I like to drink like my favorite snack is those strawberry smoothies that I drink where's just strawberries? Lemon in water really good favorite holiday. I like Christmas Because I'm basic I mean like I don't know every other holiday just seems to be like not as awesome as Christmas the best vibes The most like I don't know I slept that time of the year Christmas favorite Pastime I Like I mean you know exercising taking that editing videos filming videos taking more naps So yeah, my main form of pastime is like doing videos right now and go to the gym Favorite sport probably to my favorites I did competitive cheer which I think is a sport some people You know don't come at me, but like I think cheers the sport when it's competitive And so probably that or track because I did track This year at school, and I really liked it. What is something? You are talented at personally I don't like this question because like I don't know like I don't really know if I'm talented at anything because like you're your own Worst Critic so like I kind of think I suck at everything But like that's kind of human nature so I don't know when I'm talented at honestly. I don't have an answer for that What is something you wish you were talented at I mean I wish I was talented everything I wish I was a good saying. I wish I was like a good dancer I wish that I was I don't know I wish I was good at a lot of things I wish I was like a really fast runner. I don't know I wish I was talented that everything honestly are you competitive Ii It like depends like I can be super competitive in certain situations where I just like need to win, but then other times I'm like it. I don't really mind moving so it's like it's kind of in between describe yourself in a single sentence Oh my God. This is getting really hard um. I don't I don't know how to like put it new sens I think I'm like pretty hard working and like you know like if I get my head, okay just mechanism it if I like get set on something like I will not stop till I like get that thing and That's a sense about me. What is the best compliment you ever received? I think whatever people say like I'm a really like nice person or my kind person or people say that to me That's like probably the nicest compliment I could get because it's something I like strive to do is like be a kind person and be nice or whatever So when people say that I? Succeed at that it really makes me super happy so probably that what are some of your bad habits Probably like overthinking a lot. I definitely think about things like way too much I overanalyze every single situation ever that's probably probably um favourite things about yourself I would say is like what I said earlier how I like don't stop until I like succeed at whatever I wanted to see that and Obviously sometimes I don't succeed But if I like reach the end or like I push myself to like the highest Point that was like successful point. I can get to probably that what is on the top of your bucket list honestly I don't really have like specific things on my bucket list But I know for sure I want to I definitely want to travel more I mean, that's like a really like cliche answer But like go outside of the country or maybe go to like I don't know bali looks really cool kind of Wanna Go there like just like really like unique places. Just like explore more you know three long-term goals honestly I would just say like overall I'm not even going to say three because I only have one just like Wherever I'm at in my life at any point be like really Happy and like just genuinely happy whether that means like whatever that means in the other Aspects of my life like I don't care about that I don't care what I end up doing is that except just overall being happy and also really cliche, but like The truth three short-term global we're not that short-term that would probably mean today And that would mean try to not take it off and then try to not drink more than three coffees within one hour It's hard, and I don't know if I'm gonna succeed But I think that I might be able to so I'll let you know What are you doing today to accomplish those goals well? I haven't done anything for either of those today taking a nap wise it is currently 12 p.m. And I have not taken a nap yet. So we are going strong in that aspect the coffee thing. I already had two today, so I'm not doing so well on that one, but I think I think if I really control myself And I can wait another like 20 minutes. I might be able to only have one more coffee today. So we'll see What is your biggest accomplishment? becoming more confident and happy and summing that sexuality a big accomplishment although starting a YouTube channel because I always wanted to and It was kind of an interesting story about how it happened, so one day I will do a story time and tell you why I started youtube because it's actually really interesting But I had a channel a long time ago like in like fourth grade, and I did like outfits on there And it was like horrible, and I can't find those videos anymore Luckily like literally, thank God. They were so embarrassing But I'm probably also like starting a youtube again because I always wanted to and now I'm doing it. So that's cool What didn't I feel first date for you? Okay? Well? I don't go on dates very often Sadly This is also kind of cliche. I don't like things like going to the movies. I don't like things like a dinner Because I just like really boring to me like just so like awkward well with a movie It's just awkward because you can't talk and it's just weird and then do you like went to dinner? You're like Force like look at the other person in the face, and then they have to watch you eat I don't know do something about that's just too boring um something like really fun like in adventure like Driving somewhere kind of far away like driving to the beach or something like swimming in the ocean at like 2:00 a.m. Or something okay? That's actually good. Not really fun something like that It would be like really memorable and like special so what is something you look for in a partner I'm 16 and I have basically no experience in this topic But I would say just like somebody who is like willing to put in people effort into the relationship But also like somebody who you can trust in like the trust is mutual so like you're not worried about like where they are all the time or who they're talking to or whatever like Somebody like trust me enough that like I could like hang out with another guy friend and like the guy wouldn't care you know also Just somebody who's like genuinely kind and like thoughtful of me and my feelings because I'm like emo I'm kidding um but like yes, so he's like really like considers your feelings. I'm bad at this stuff. Who is your role model? I would say like definitely my parents. I mean for sure like that's an obvious one I was something like a really inspirational person is like Casey nice - a youtuber. He's a great person I don't know. He's really inspirational to me which one of your parents Are you more like depends like really similar to my dad because we like the same music We like doing the same things he has a Youtube channel, too We both like to like go Like explore in the City and like you know I get coffee and stuff except I think we have a lot of like I also think I'm aligned with my mom because you know we both like enjoy it sort Of women parts of like life like shopping and like stuff like that So it kind of depends which one of your parents are you closest to this is also kind of like I don't have one or the other I'm close with both equally in like different ways because I'm an only child Only children get really close with their parents so both honestly What is the last book you read um I don't read like I genuinely do not read ever because I hate it I don't know why I just don't like reading unless I find like a really really good book that I like really love I Just don't read so I don't have an answer for that. What is your favorite fairy tale? pfft I don't freaking know like I ever like what what even is a fairy tale like I mean I know but like I know I don't Have an answer What is your favorite quote I hate reading quotes out loud like something about that is so corny to me But let me look at my pinterest on my quote board And I'll just read one that I find how the keep it simple good things are coming That's a good one remember that kids keep doing that good mindset. You know favorite subject in school probably science It's the most interesting to me It's also one of the hardest classes in school for me, but I do enjoy science so probably that I like biology more than chemistry definitely subject you were best at Honestly like depends because like I don't think I'm very like it depends on like if you mean like which I personally think I strive at or like which one has a better grade like that's just different, but like I think I'm Okay, at like history and stuff like that, but I absolutely hate it So it's like I dunno like I'm probably better at history and English, than I am at like math and science But like I enjoy math and science more Don't ask me why favorite teacher honestly? I don't have an answer I liked all of my teachers in Elementary school and the second I got to high school the relationships Weren't as good in high school, and I'm still in high school Yeah, it's just a lot more on the line a lot more tension. So that's that. Who has left the biggest impact on your life? probably my parents because They've always been there my whole entire life So there's really nobody else in this entire universe who could have more of an impact on me than my parents because I've been around Them my whole life, and I'm an only child and they're like the biggest influence on me What app do you use most? Probably Instagram or Visco. What piece of technology could you not live without? Honestly, I don't just have one. Phone, laptop very important, and camera also very important But if for some reason I couldn't have a camera the phone as the camera so probably phoned and laptop. What countries Have you visited well I've been out of the country twice. I went to Ireland and then I went to the Dominican Republic What countries would you LIKE to visit? If it was up to me, I would visit every country in the entire universe... so... Most embarrassing memory? Oh my God, okay This is really good. So basically like I did cello in fifth grade um which is weird considering I literally four foot six inches and probably weighed 50 pounds and was basically the size of a cello But anyway it was the end of the school year and we had like our last recital thing, parents were there Grandparents were there uncles, aunts, everybody you can think of was there. The crowd was going Wild when we finally finished our fifth grade orchestra performance and all of us sucked. We probably sounded like actual crap considering we were literally fifth graders and Barely had brains developed yet, just kidding that's not true But you know what I mean um anyway, so obviously it at the end of the year they gave out awards for people who are really outstanding So I was sitting there in my chair. You know I wasn't expecting to get an award because well I just didn't play like I literally move my fingers and just like lightly put my bow the bow I'll insert a Bow across like the thing I wouldn't even make any noise with my actual cello I would just kind of like fake it the whole time, so I wasn't really expecting An award because I really didn't deserve it basically I heard our conductor guy say like ""all Of the people who play cello stand up."" That's why I heard in my brain, okay? I don't know why I've heard this because that is not what he said he said ""blank name stand up"" I thought he said ""all the people who play cello stand up,"" but it turned out. He said like This cello player stand up, and it said her name, and then she stood up well, I stood up with her But I didn't win the award tho [Emma displays an uncomfortable amount of awkward silence as she remembers her sense of embarrasment that day] Okay, moving on. How many relationships have you been in? haha ONE in Fifth grade so but I mean I guess in you're 16 you don't need to be in a relationship, so I guess it's fine, but I'm No, I'm just kidding. I'm good. Single life is the best life, ya know? If you could give your younger self any advice, what would it be? You will never regret being kind one thing that you know now that you wish you would have known as a kid that's like the same question and I'll say it again. You will never regret being kind ever Okay Like I just remember how me and everybody was in Middle school to each other and it was just the norm you know Second grade self girl would steal your sticker and talk about a freaking fight and like at this point in my life I've learned you know just be the bigger person always be kind no matter what anybody says or does to you being kind you will Never regret it okay. Tea, or coffee? Okay coffee. I'm sorry That's just like not even a question. I don't even Like that we don't even need to discuss it okay coffee How tall are you I am five three and a half but I think I'm 5'4 now soooo I don't know. Cats or dogs? um Dogs, I mean, I don't know I just like dogs better. Sorry. All you cat people, no hate I have cats and dogs so like yeah, but dogs are just better. I feel like everybody who doesn't like dogs doesn't have one So like that's the answer to that. Funniest moment throughout school? Honestly I feel like all moments in school are absolute hell Rather than anything funny. I usually am not laughing during school, I'm usually crying Hysterically constantly because of how much I actually despise being there if I think of one later, I'll let you know But like for right now all my memories are just absolute terror Are you in slash have you gone to college? I am going to be a junior next year stone, no What was your worst subject in high school um while I'm in high school now and worse subject honestly I think my least favorite would have to be English I just think it's so boring But I think the one that I was like the worst outlet had the worst grade was probably like chemistry But like I actually really liked chemistry so it's kind of like a love-hate favorite animal, okay? I really I really like all animals I think it's easier to say the ones that I don't like I have a actual phobia like no joke dead-ass phobia of Caterpillars I hate them, but I don't even like I don't care about snakes I spiders or if you like if they're near me, I freaked out, but is there like 10 feet away from me I don't care um like I'm cool. Doll that Caterpillars just Really make me lose it like I just I can't if they're near me if I see a picture of one like I will Initiate I don't know I don't know it's mental. What sports do you play? So have you played well earlier? I mentioned that I did cheer and track, but I also did okay. This is going to take a while. I did karate Taekwondo when I was like six so that happened, so I did ice skating I did gymnastics I did I never did any like ball sports. I can ever do softball or soccer. I never did any of that, and then I did cheerleading Competitively, then I also did in high school two year for like a half of a year And then I did cross-country for one year, and then I did track for one year And I did both of those track and cross-Country slash your favorites book Oh, I don't really have one, but I did really like okay I don't know if anybody remembers these books, but it was like I need to look up the title you'll have em like literally myself so that I can find it, okay I finally found it, so I'll insert a picture here, but it was this series And it's like if you're reading this it's too late and no not talking about the drake album cover I'm talking about these books, and I was like younger when I read them, but like no joke if I read them today I would still enjoy them because they were so good like I don't know why they're like teen books But they're so good like I I need to read them again because I haven't read them since like seventh grade but
They were like my favorite books read like no joke it would be like a 500 page book and I would go through it in Like no joke three days and like it's I like reading if I find a book I like it's that I don't like that many books.

https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-06-28T00:06:44Z,18942,620569,294,"Breakfast Yayyyy So as you can see I just blew up this thingy. Hopefully, it's not like ruined or has like a hole in it because that took me literally Forever and it took all of my freaking lung power to fricking fill that thing, but I think it'll be worth it I'm gonna float around in the ocean and around you know of... pool. I am so tired like literally I just took a 15 minute nap and I keep having like vivid dreams every time I nap, it's like really weird I have my outfit all picked out so and then I'm gonna go take some pictures, of course. So we're here. We're all dressed. We got I got my freaking Tube. That's actually the most annoying thing to carry around It hits everything um, but yeah So I'm ready I'm about to go take some pictures right now um just took pics by the Beach honestly Check my instagram like I've been posting so much on this trip. I post so much when I'm on vacation It's honestly bad like people get really annoyed with me, but I love it. I love posting. I get to wear my outfits. it's just fun. So  yeah check out my instagram. So currently I'm air dropping pictures. My mom's own onto my phone Because I have no storage on my phone, so I have my so I have to take them on my mom's phone and then airdrop the ones I like to me and so anyway, but yeah So that's that people are staring at me. They don't understand what I'm doing honestly I don't even understand what I'm doing so I don't blame them But yeah, and then I'm gonna float around in the little Tube and I'm excited about it Oh you got it! I like did a backflip off it Post... bodysurfing. I just randomly went into body surf, and then I got tumbled by a wave and like almost died just kidding not even close But I mean, it scared the shit out of me. Okay. Let's go over here But now I'm gonna rinse off in the shower because I literally have after being tumbled like that I have sand in every crevice of my body. I need to shower off in this little shower okay, so Currently walking back to the room, naked, because I have this bright little idea that I would take the floaty out all the way to like the really deep end of the water with goggles and a GoPro and see what I could find because yesterday I tried to snorkel over there But the water it was so rough that it was just too hard so what I'm thinking is What if I just like go out there with a freaking floaties in goggles? and then just like dip my head in the in the ground like And then just dip my head into the water and see what I can find so that's I'm going to do I have to go all the way back to the room right now alone. I've no clue where the frick it is To get goggles because I don't have any because I'm a idiot so yeah, so that's my plan pretty excited about it I think because earlier. I saw some fish and They were just in the shallow end, so I'm like if I go into the deep end like there's no way. I won't find something I have to walk on the grass because my feet are burning like literally burning Thank you, so much Well okay, so as you can probably see my little idea didn't work out, but instead now. We're going to go on a Kayak I Look bald, but I'm not um yeah, we're going to want to Kayak. So we're signing it for that now I went in the pool for a little bit to sit decompress after lunch and also because I was pretty POed Because I couldn't see any fish, but that's a okay it happens Its kinda windy so Yeah, we're gonna go in a kayak pretty pumped about it. We'll see how it goes The kayaking worked out pretty well, but my mom got seasick and we had to stop but it was still kind of fun So yeah all the times I've tried to snorkel on this trip It hasn't worked out so we just planned a snorkel excursion on a boat for tomorrow that'll be cool. I got like my 1900 drink of the day, and I'm just going to tan for a little bit And yeah, that's about it. My face is so Sunburned none of you can tell I don't know What's happening, but my face is so burnt because I forgot to put sunscreen on it, or I forgot to reapply and so I'm an idiot"

We woke up a little bit later today, on accident. Because... I guess the time change made it so that if we woke up at um 7:00 which is what we wanted to do we'd be waking up at like 4:00 a.m. our time So that just didn't work out, but yeah, so we're walking to breakfast right now. Okay, I think this is getting fogged up It's really humid. Yeah, so I guess there was a storm last night. Didn't affect us though! Did me! Why? It woke me up! Cause you're a weenie hut jr Yeah, it didn't affect me though cause I was sleeping. But yeah, so breakfast time! I'm pretty pumped. The breakfast here is good It's a buffet. Which is like who can complain about that. We got some fruit some dates Veggies, and then a little hash brown because do you know what? You gotta frickin' treat yo self. And also because it looked too good, I just had to get it Slight change of plans, which I hate. I hate changing my plans, but because we woke up a little bit later day We didn't make it to the gym on time before a spin class started, so instead And I was like whatever I'll just workout in the room um so I just did a little workout in the room Which was hard because then I have to do it on this hard floor? And my back is a little bit hurting, but it is a-okay because you know gotta do whatcha gotta do. Basically almost done with that Then I have my outfits all laid out. My bathing suit all laid out. You know we ready Okay, so just got our drinks. Right now we're going to the beach. We're bout to sit under a little thingy. Think it's called a pulapa. But I don't like to call that cause it just doesn't feel right to me So I call it like a little beach bungalow. Even though it's nothing like a bungalow at all Um, we just took pictures. Oh my god My outfit is like so out there people just like don't understand who I am Um, the think that there's something like they are like confused They're like who is she and why is she dressed like that? Anyway So yeah, we're going to the beach right now And then I'm going to tan and then I'm gonna boogie board And I'm freakin' pumped, cause I love boogie boarding and then after that later, we're getting our nails done And I'm pretty pumped for that too. I don't know what color I'm gonna get. But definitely something tropical, you know? Gotta like feel the vibes. So yeah, just drinking our drinks Wearing our outfits. I love this outfit It's great, so yeah, it's a good time currently doing my 10 minutes of um designated tanning time. Where I just tan with no sunscreen. Then after that, I'm boutta. I wanna go scuba. No, not scuba. I'm an idiot. Snorkeling! Cause I have my snorkeling gear right here, and I'm gonna snorkel for a little bit So it's gonna be a great time and I cannot frickin' wait Post Snorkel sesh, didn't really...  thank you! Didn't really see anything... that was good, and then it was like super duper wavy So I was like, you know what? I'm just gonna boogie board instead. Cause I frickin' love boogie boarding. So I'm about to go do that right now It's too painful to walk on the sidewalk. I have to walk on the grass, but that's okay. Whoo! Look what we got! We got ourselves a little board thing. It's time to party. Hell yeah Returned the boogie board. A sad time, just kidding not really Um, I was done. I'm like a little bit beat up. Just kidding, not really. But anyways um So I'm gonna lay out for another few minutes, and then we're gonna get lunch We're gonna get lunch because I'm really hungry. Lunch today is some fruit, some rice, some lentil stuff. We'll see it kind of looks gross, but we'll see. And then some vegetables. Yay. Just finished with lunch and um It was pretty good It was definitely really good. Probably one of the best lunches we've had so far. Something kind of weird happened Somebody was like speaking a different language. Came up to me and was like yelling at me about my bag And I was like, what? So I don't really know what that was all about But it kind of freaked me out because they're yelling at me in like some European language I had no clue what they were saying. But um that's over Nobody still to this day No one can figure out what they were trying to say and the staff were trying to figure it out too - nobody can figure it out Anyway, um yeah, that's it My legs are absolutely killing me. Today was leg day. Cause you know, gains or whatever Okay, I'm gonna go swim in the pool now Literally had to get out of the pool because I have to pee so bad I've literally just been drinking so many different drinks. A.K.A. club soda with lime and coffee I've been drinking so much liquid, because it's like free, like you can just get it as much as you want so I'm like peeing every five minutes. It's so bad Walking back to our room to freshen up before we get our mani pedis. Oh my God I'm really stressing out like I don't know what color I should get. I know I don't even know what they have to offer, so it's kind of like Well that's true. What if they only have like one color and it's like periwinkle. Actually I like periwinkle So that would be fine, well we'll see. I picture them only offering like pinks and reds True, but like that's fine too. Okay well, we'll see Got our nails did. They look good. I got some minty on my fingers and on my toes, I got little red. Wow, this music... Vibin'. We're so hungry, we 'bout to go get a snack. From the buffet thing. Love the buffet. Favorite place of my entire life. And they have a bunch of fresh fruit all the time. It's great! I don't know if you can tell, but it's raining. So, basically we just went to the restaurant We were supposed to eat at a Mediterranean restaurant or like... Was that what it was? Mediterranean? All of the food had meat in it. And I'm a vegetarian... um... And so that's not going to work. So we're going to the buffet now It's the end of the day. I'm about to take a shower, and I have to brush out all of this. I don't know you can tell; I don't know if this is working at all. But it's... It's a mess um yeah, so that concludes today's vlog.

https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-06-25T05:06:30Z,23775,772971,709,"Good morning so I am out on my deck right now we have like a little deck connected to our hotel I guess. Due to my lack of vlogging so far today. I'll give you a little update We went and we got breakfast and then I went to the gym about 10 o'clock We have like a little fridge that comes in the hotel and a beer fell out of it when I opened it because I Was going to get the snacks that came in the hotel room because it's like all-inclusive They give you a bunch of snacks and stuff so I'm going to be trying some of the Dominican Republic snacks. To make up for the fact that I didn't vlog earlier today. Okay, so the first snack, oh my god I'm like sweating so much right now So the first snack I'm going to be trying are these Hatuey I'm not gonna pronounce any of this right. Soda? So I don't know what that means, I guess these are just soda crackers... whatever that means. So let's try it. Oh, shoot, okay, so they're big, I guess you, oh! Oh my god, they're so dry, but they're actually pretty good. They're a little bit dry oh my god I'm like coughing and dying. Okay. They're pretty good They're a little dry. But basically they're just like an American saltine. I give these a thumbs up. Next we have Lays except for that, They're not the same as American ones, so we'll see what the difference is. I don't normally eat stuff like this, so I don't even know, like I don't even eat Lays, so we'll see how they taste I don't even know what regular Lays taste like but, tastes like a damn good potato chip to me. That's all. So these are like ruffles, but they're also look different like, oh my god. Oh, it says that they're $15, okay? Well, that's interesting. Okay, these like look different. Way smaller I feel like. Uh-huh, maybe I just don't like ruffles, but these taste a little bit different? Eh. They're fine, but I don't really like Ruffles anyway. Okay, now to the more like cultural stuff. I guess these are plantain chips. We'll see how it goes. Ooh, they're super thin. Ooh, these are really good. These are good. I think these are my favorite thing so far. Ooh! Fuente de fibra. So maybe there's a lot of fiber in them. Those are good. Last but not least I'm gonna be trying a Dominican Republic orange juice. I bet it's really different from the kind at home. Cause you know, that would like, make sense, right? I'm just not realizing that all this is like basically American stuff, but just like with Spanish, um, writing on it, and I just like assumed that it was like different, but it's like basically the same. But I mean, hey I hope you enjoyed anyways.   Ooh, this is actually really good orange juice. Oh my God. Does this have like...? Oh, this has like added stuff. I was gonna say, I was like that tastes like an orange creamsicle, but it makes sense because its actually like has like a bunch of added sugar and stuff. So it is kind of different! I just realized that that was kind of pointless and dumb because like literally the Dominican Republic food and snacks is kind of like the same as it is in America But I mean hey, it looked a little bit different. So I was like why not, but um, hope you enjoyed this segment of the vlog anyways, to make up for the lack of the vlogging of the breakfast and the gym. Tomorrow I will include that, do not stress. Let's go to the beach. So we bouta go get ourselves some coconuts right now, because supposedly they have fresh coconuts at this time of the day And I want one so bad. I actually like coconut milk. I'm not a po- or not coconut milk. I actually like coconut water, I'm not a poser.   Perfect. Thank you, so much. We got our freaking coconuts, the beach. Ok, so my plan is, update We moved to one of these little bungalow things. This little bungalowey thing is, there's my coconut right there just chillin frickin being beautiful, I mean like look at that, so beautiful! And the good thing about this hotel is, these coconuts, these coconuts are frickin included so you can just get as many as you want all day long which is really great. My plan is to tan for the first 10 minutes with no sunscreen. Yes everybody, you heard it here first I'm not gonna use sunscreen for 10 minutes then I'm gonna put sunscreen on, because I want to get a little tan, like you know, cause I'm putting on a sh- crap ton of sunscreen and It'll just be boring So I'm moving this chair into the sun I'm about to die right now. It's frickin hot, so like, I'm just gonna try not to die So that's my view right now, not complaining. Coconut is still on its way, I cannot finish that son of a, anyway, so I changed into my bathing suit and Then I'm still wearing my shorts I just put them back on because I had to film a little clip of me wearing my outfit for a like little travel outfits idea video that I'm making, um, yeah, which basically an outfit of the week, like all the outfits I'm wearing on this trip, um, but yeah So I just finished filming that. I tanned for like ten minutes and it actually felt really good Hope I didn't get a burn or anything I tried to like tan for a very short amount of time just so that I'd get some Vitamin D before I put a shit ton of sunscreen all over myself. Um, I'm living for this bandana. It's so comfortable like ten out of ten, would recommend. Bandanas, just to like tie around your head. It's just like so comfortable, and it like kind of like, I don't know, it's just great. Okay, so bun is up now because I'm frickin lazy. We're going to the pool now because... I don't know we haven't been there yet, there's like a swim-up bar you can like swim up and get drinks and to me that sounds pretty frickin dope, so I'm gonna do that and yeah! Ow! Okay, so of course we had to feed our iced coffee addiction They gave us iced coffee in one of these which is really funny cause it's just like not meant for iced coffee but they did, so that was weird, but now we have them in this cup But it's just black and we don't have straws so I don't think they do iced coffee around here very often But I mean I'm not really mad, coffee is coffee. Back on the beach, got my coffee. I actually think I'm getting tan It's happening! If anybody watches The Office, you know what I'm talking about. My God! Okay! It's happening! I am feeling bronzed, and happy. Just got our third or fourth coffee of the day, honestly no regrets, um and then setup Mani-Pedi for tomorrow because you know, gotta treat yourse- yoself, also my nails are in horrible condition, um, but yeah, so Mani-Pedis tomorrow, pretty pumped about it. We thought, we have like resort credit But I guess like they like tell you what you can spend it on and that, I don't want to spend it on the things they gave it to me, to spend on. Like we have like Casino credit, like I'm 16 I don't want to go to the casino. I don't even think I'm allowed to go to the casino, can I? I don't want to anyway. I would lose money. Hold on I'm filming. Basically how this hotel works is that you get to like choose a few restaurants that you like and then they'll like tell you when you can go to them, if that makes sense, it's super confusing. Anyway, not really important. So right now I'm opening up the paper to find out where we're going to dinner tonight. Tonight we're going to Fuego, but that's where we're going to dinner, and it's, I think it's like, wait is this one I think this we have to wear like nice clothes, so I have to dress up. Alright, so we have dinner in like a few hours, but I was like you know what? I'm hungry, so we just came to the buffet for a little bit, got some fruit. She got some weird random, little weird, weird things that are weird, no I'm just kidding, um but yeah, so we're about to eat this right now and um, I'm excited for dinner. What happened in between this was we went to the beach and sat on the beach for like a solid... hour, just chill, literally did nothing, but now we're at dinner and it's like a, like Latin fusion place But I literally got potatoes, veggies, and like some like, I don't know, like wrap things, so I mean we'll see how it is, we're probably gonna have to go to the buffet later to get more food But yeah, we're here. It's pretty classy, they give us a nice bread, and there's like a nice candle and it's like all these vibes going on here. Vibes. Okay. Okay, so we finished dinner. It was extremely classy, um I forgot to show it though, but it wasn't really interesting Um, yeah, very classy, but now we're kind of still hungry. So we're going to, back to the buffet now So my mom just got some dessert But then I was like I want another club soda because I'm weird, so I got another club soda, my like 18th one today, and it's at this cool like light-up bar thing and like the beach, that's, I don't know if you can tell but that's like the beach out there There's like a bunch of light up chairs and stuff, it's pretty cool So I think I'm gonna end the vlog here. That's basically all I did today, about to go to bed after I finish this and yeah, I'll see you tomorrow."

https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-06-23T00:16:54Z,44201,1498194,1111,"  Today's day that we leave for our trip, yes. Good morning. It is- about 8:20. Today I have to finish up packing, go to the gym and then get on a plane. If anybody saw my vlog like, from a while ago. I mentioned that I don't have Spotify Premium, but today, I realized I need it because number one, there's like a 99- It's like 99 cents for three months or something, which is like really good. Well, that's like the deal that they're having or whatever. And then after that you have to pay the normal amount, but then also well number one I'm just late to the game, like I'm so late to the game. Like everybody has Spotify Premium. Not having it sucks like, is like the worst thing So I was like ""okay, I just need to get it."" The main reason why I wanted to get it was because there's like an Element in it where it's like you can download all your playlists or whatever you guys already know this because I'm just late in not Like Tech Savvy, but like even like download all your playlists So that you can listen to them like without any phone or computer connection so like importantly downloading all of my playlists To my computer so that I can listen to them on the plane so yeah, so just doing this chillin I'll just post my video or my Packing with me video. Which is kind of a random video, but yeah, and then I need to finish up packing basically everything's packed We got clothes accessories Pajamas workout clothes undergarments, you know all that stuff shoes hats Sunscreen Shampoo conditioner toiletries food items Makeup outer clothing then under that I have on my bathing suits and then I have set up The clothes that I'm wearing on the plane for a more, in-depth view of how I pack And packing in General check out the video. I just posted a pack with me video where I basically go in-depth on what I pack and kind of how I pack. Alright I'm Gonna go to the gym. Yeah I'm gonna. I'll go to Target because they have to get frozen strawberries ""all right"" for my smoothie alright peace out, okay? So I just spent the past Umm three and a half hours watching The Office because that's the best show ever. Now I'm going to the gym and then after that I'm going to target because I have to get some last-minute stuff aka Frozen strawberries because, that's been in my favorite smoothie lately, and I just ran out ,and there's no way that I can like leave my house today and not have one more of those before I leave for my trip because they're best goddamn smoothie in the entire universe okay, so     Oh God, I think that, okay that's my mom's music not mine. Then after I get my strawberries I'll show you guys the recipe to my strawberry smoothie. It's very simple and weird, but it's the back thing ever it's so good It's so good. This is my first time driving with spotify premium. I am so freaking pumped right now I don't know what song I'm going to play, but it's going to be a good time I am a mess, but we're here. That was quite a jam sesh, if I've ever had one. It was pretty lit ,you know just me myself and I having the time of our life um but what can I say, it was a good time and Now I'm here, so I'll see you guys after my workout But if you want my workout routine or something comment down below I guess, ew self promo I guess, see you after my workout Okay Post-workout Feeling freaking sweaty so um I'm going to turn on the AC. Um but yes, I'm going to target right now to get some last-minute stuff Alright, so quick a lil update. We just made it to Target which is on the opposite side of town than my gym So that's convenient I know I've already said this like four times, but why not say it again just in case I didn't say it enough times I'm getting frozen Strawberries and Snorkeling gear, and if I leave with anything else, that will be bad, but honestly who will be surprised I don't know which ones to get. Target run completed You guys have no joke been down there for like probably like a bazillion minutes, and I feel horrible, but I'm here now. Okay, um I'm not naked I'm wearing a towel so calm down um but little warning if you don't like blood don't watch this it's not that big of a deal but some people might be disturbed by it. I cut the freaking crap out of my foot while shaving my legs. It doesn't really hurt, but it's bleeding a lot. It's a little bit intense, I'm going to clean that up and then after I clean that up I'm going to be applying some of this loving tan to our express. My method for vacation is to tan Or, is to put on fake tan before I go ,and Then basically replace my fake tan with a real tan as my fake tan fades if that makes any sense. So I'm gonna show you guys my smoothie recipe pull, fill up the cup It's super like slushy and ugh, so good So we are on our way to the airport now Going to Sfo flight is delayed by how many. Our flights delayed by two hours, but our layover is nice and squishy So we're not too stressed. Update we are at Sfo But yeah, we're checking our bags right now, and that's about it. I'm pretty pumped yeah, I mean like I would go shopping in there, but like I'm just kind of lazy right now like I'm just lazy. You know Just got to the security and we are chilling time to spare Almost really four hours we've literally four hours, so yeah Going to the bathroom right now the you know, the funnest the funnest part of the airport the bathroom, hehe no. We've been in the airport for about, probably have been here for about an hour. Honestly time is going by pretty quickly, I feel like. I'm not only like impatient We have three hours until we board, and I'm feeling good It's almost like the warriors won or something Um are you guys still doing coffee right now? So no like Espresso drinks. No worries um Okay Right over there they had ritual coffee they had a ritual coffee, but they just closed the espresso machine five minutes before I'm going to ******* die. I have this like whenever, I'm in the airport I just have this need to eat constantly like I just I don't know why I just Want to eat everything and I'm not even hungry And then I just like it's just like empty calories like I'm just going to go sit there, but I want to eat Is it bored eating? It's like a whole new level of bored eating. A few hours have gone by it's now It's only 10:24, and I'm so tired I've been just watching Youtube I just got a request on my YouTube channel to do a um Q&A so if you guys want a Q&A (questions and answers) leave some questions down in the comments down below. It is 11:00 So basically, Oh my God its so freaking rude. So basically the deal is, Oh my God, I literally can't talk without an announcement going off Okay, here's the deal. I'm gonna try to talk in between the announcements because they're so loud, and it's like unbelievable so basically it's 11:36, we're boarding in about 15 to 20 minutes. After that I'm getting on the plane and I'm gonna end this vlog And I'm going to start the vlog again, or start a new vlog which will be a new day, technically This is probably the last time. I'll talk to you today. So thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this stay tuned for tomorrow's vlog subscribe if you enjoyed peace out"

https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-06-17T18:40:03Z,44178,1801957,925,"Good morning, everyone. No I did not cut my hair it is just tucked into my sweatshirt it is around 8:45 I'm making myself some breakfast and If you didn't see yesterday's vlog Basically what's going on is I had to drive an hour and a half away to take my driver's test I passed, but then they could not print out my like Temporary driver's license so that you can like drive alone or whatever they couldn't print it out for me So now I have to go to the DMV this morning to pick it up from a different DMV. It's so complicated so that's what I'm doing today, but then after that I'm actually going to drive alone and I'm going to take you guys with me on my first adventure as an independent woman just kidding, I'm still a child but you know what I mean, so let's get into the day Oh, and I also have a hair appointment, and I'm getting my hair done And I'm really excited today's a wild day a lot gonna happen, and I'm taking you along with me great So here we are again day two of spending the Day at the DMV I hope That today is a little bit shorter Supposedly, I only have to pick up my driver's license today. Don't have to take any tests. Don't have to do anything else We'll see I hope that they stay true to their word Anyone knows anything about the DMV you know that it takes like a solid, I don't know two hours to do anything so wish us luck. I hope that today is a little bit shorter Where am I? One eternity later. Okay update we just waited at the DMV for About 50 minutes and they never called my number, but I have a hair appointment so I have to go and um never accomplished anything basically just wasted the last 50 minutes at the DMV for nothing But I have to go get my hair done now and then after that we're going back to the DMV Getting my hair done took three and a half hours So now I have to go back to the DMV to try to get my license for the second time I'm Not very happy about this my mom's not very happy about this and then after that I can finally drive alone and my first Destination is going to be the gym So i'll let you know if any of that works out. We are back Normally, I'd say, we're back, and we're better, but I think it'd be more appropriate to say we're back and we're madder *airhorn noises* I'm just waited in the line for like an hour, and I just want to get my fricking thing Already, but you know patience is key okay, so bye and we got it I can drive alone now, but I have to drop my mom off first and then I'm off to Okay, and then I'm off to my first destination alone, and I'm going to bring you with me and it's going to be a great time. Guess who just drove themselves all the way to the gym safely soundly all by themselves. This girl. I didn't want to film while I was driving because I didn't want to be unsafe you know anyway Yeah, one of the many things a little more interesting But I decided it was the best option to just play it safe and just drive safely um and not be an idiot So yeah right now I'm going to the gym. I have a concert tonight at hold on, I have a concert in Don't know a few hours. So I have only a little bit of time to work out But I want to make the most out of it, and I'm just excited because I drove myself here alone And it was totally fun. I got to listen to my music and it's just great and I like knew my way here Which is really good. I was like nervous about that, but yeah, so we're here. I'm at the gym I drove here alone, and I'm super freakin pumped. A few moments later Okay, so just finished at the gym Good workout, but I had to rush it a little bit because I have to be home by 5:00 4:29 right now, so I'm leaving right on time because I am driving home in Major traffic, so that's fun but Can you just turn the Ac back on some freaking sweating up a storm, but I'm driving home now, and yeah I have a concert. Concerts at 7:00, but I take the train going to be a quite a quite a journey So I'm not too pumped, but I'm pumped I guess whatever okay. Yeah, I don't know if I'll see you tomorrow or to continue the vlog or if this is the end of the vlog so if this the end of the vlog then peace out if Not then I'll see you in the next clip. I don't know so yeah"

https://www.youtube.com/user/JoakimKarud/",2017-06-16T00:30:40Z,37407,1265782,908,"Good morning. It's currently 6 a.m. I woke up at 5 today and I'm not very tired because I think my sleep schedule is adjusting to waking up early which I love. Yes, so it's 6 am I have sunglasses on to cover up my puffy eyes and today Me and my mom are going on a little road trip. Not really, but we're driving about an hour. Now you may be wondering For what a event/occasion are we driving like an hour away for And the answer is I have my driver's license test today No days were available for my location near where I live so I have to drive like an hour To get to my testing location First stop of the day: the freaking gas station Fun. I'm just kidding. I hate getting gas. It's my least favorite thing ever and also if you're wondering why I'm not driving today It's because it's actually a really long way to get there and my mom just was like well ""You should rest your brain"" you know what that's okay with me because whatever okay, so We are driving through San Francisco right now, and I just had to include it because it just looks too damn pretty right now Kinda wish I was going here instead but Okay, so um, just like a quick little shower thought even though not in the shower and um yeah But there's these like things okay, you can kinda see what they look like. To me they look kind of like dinosaurs And I was thinking and I was like okay, but Imagine like a few million years ago or something Those were like real dinosaurs, but now they're freaking dead (miss keisha? miss keisha? oh my fucking god she fucking dead) My driver's license appointment is at 11:40. Yes 11:40, but my mom wanted to skip the traffic and get here a little bit early, so I'm actually totally cool with that um, She's just quite the planner. So you know gotta do what you gotta do Lemme get out of the car Okay, okay Oh yeah, so we're here. Three and half hours early, but we're gonna get coffee right now. Which is totally cool with me Yeah, I have like three hours to kill so I don't know what I'm going to do But we'll make it work. I'm also vlogging in public This is new for me, but it's kind of fun. And no one's judging me so far. So we'll see how it goes We're finding a freaking bathroom because we both have to pee then I'm going to take pictures because Instagram is [redacted] life and don't ever say that I'm wrong because Pics or it didn't happen right okay right? Let's freakin go. Mom: You have to look at this watch. She's trying to like understand Snapchat.  She just doesn't get it what ha- Mom: So if you don't tap the right thing you can't replay the snap? You have to like hold it down You'll figure it out buddy. You'll figure it out Mom: You order first Oh, I'll have an iced almond milk latte Looks good to me. I already drank it. It's been about five minutes. We just finished our coffee it was really delish. My mom spilled some on herself so she had to button her denim jacket so that nobody could see. You know what accidents happen, and she's persevering through it. So that's good, right? Mom: That's right :) So we're at this store and they have just like a bunch of healthy snacks So are you loading up a little bit? Mom: Yes So she's loading up I'm not because I'm not really hungry right now Kind of want another coffee Should I do it? I don't know. Update: didn't get more coffee. I know it's a disappointment It is to me as well, but we're going to go drive around . now So that I can practice driving in this area because I have no clue I mean, it's probably the same as anywhere else But I've never driven here before but so I need to like kind of figure it out. I guess um, But I do want more coffee So we might have to find another place because I need to feed my addiction. You know? right now, we are Driving around the DMV and I'm pretty nervous for my frickin test because I'm not from this area So I'm just hoping and praying to the driving lords that I do well. So post driving around the DMV We were driving around this town, and I found a freaking thrift shop, and I'm really pumped right now so we'll see. Hopefully I find something good in the 30 minutes before my test thingy starts We'll see So I found these but sadly They are too small. I was planning thing on cutting them, but they're too small, but all of these work Thrift hall coming soon. Pretty excited about the stuff I just picked up. Spent under $20 and bought like ten things So, I'd say it was a pretty successful shopping trip Okay, so I'm on my way to the DMV right now We just had a nice little leisurely time, but I'm really nervous. I have my test in like 30 minutes, and I'm freaking scared because I have no clue how it's going to go. I don't live in this area. I'm really scared I'm not driving right now. My mom's driving because I'm just too nervous to drive but We'll see how it goes I'll let you know after because I feel like the DMV is kind of like busy and like sketchy and you're not really supposed to film in there, so I Guess I'll see you after. So you'll know in like one second if I passed or not And I really hope I did so we'll see what happens. So fast forward I just took my test. I went into the DMV it was extreme- Oh my God my phone just vibrated. It was extremely intense- oh my God I'm getting a text. Okay anyways um I was very nervous. It was very scary, but I passed I'm now-  I can now drive alone except for that I can't because I have to wait till tomorrow to get my like What is it called? like my like paper license because they couldn't give it to me today which is kind of frustrating so I can't technically drive alone yet today, but tomorrow So now I have to go to another DMV tomorrow morning To get my actual driver's license paper printed out thing. So that kind of sucks because I can't actually drive alone yet, and I don't technically even have my license Right now, but I technically passed so it's a little bit complicated, but after tomorrow everything will make sense So I guess today is kind of over. I'll see you tomorrow For not don't worry. Okay anyways"
JNYEgrZT-2s,TRY-ON THRIFT HAUL,"thanks for stoppin by, hope you enjoyed:) i plan on uploading 1+ times per week, so subscribe to be notified when I post a new video!! 

In this video I show a haul of all of the thrifted clothing items I picked up! Some stuff is vintage, and others are just random haha. Hope you enjoy!",2017-06-15T02:53:45Z,35901,1255763,596,"Hey guys, it's Emma. Today I'm going to be doing a thrift haul. So I went thrift shopping today, there was so much good stuff and the prices were so good. Nothing was more than four dollars and I literally spent only 20 bucks on everything, so yeah, I hope you enjoyed and... *door slams shut* [to mom] Was that you? That was like really scary- oh my- it looked like a human opened and closed it, but I guess it was just the wind- okay anyways- oh, I also forgot to mention: This is a Try-On Haul, because Try-On Hauls are way better than regular hauls. I hope you enjoy and... let's get into it. Okay, I hope that this is in focus. Okay, so, the first thing I got is like a weird vintage kind of wind breaker and the brand is ""izod"", And I don't really know what that is. Just by looking at the tag and kind of how worn it is, it's definitely, like, old. Like I know sometimes at thrift shops, you can get, like, new stuff, but, like, this is not new this definitely looks, like, old or kind of vintage. It's cool, it actually fits really well, and it just kind of like a unique... ...kind of, like, item, like, I just I've never seen anything like it, and I just kind of had to have it. Next item is, um, a little bit, mmm, interesting, but I love, like, love, love, love. I love turtlenecks. So, I just got this like... S- mm, I don't even know I just got this blue and white striped turtleneck, and it just kind of like the fold over kind, and this is the brand ""Crazy Horse"" I don't really know what that is. But, um, it's really comfortable, super soft, the material is, like, great, I just thought that it was are really kind of, you know, good basic, and it was like that one I think was only one dollar so I was like yeah, I'm definitely... DEFINITELY gonna do that. Okay, so the next thing i got, was this blue shirt, and this reminded me of something that they had Brandy [Melville] for awhile Just this blue top that's collared. I think this is really cool. It's kind of unique, um, but it also kinda reminds me of Brandy and I literally got this for less than three dollars, so definitely a good deal. I was pretty pumped about that. This next thing is just this Banana Republic... um, kinda like Button-Down shirt and this is like a nice shirt, like, definitely a nice shirt. Really well made and, like, super new and clean, like, literally this is in such great condition I basically got this because I felt like it could look really... like, clean and, like, preppy with, like, white jeans or even white shorts during the summer. I just thought that it could be like styled really well, it could also be a nice bathing suit cover-up, in a way, anyway. I thought this was cool I thought that I could figure out a way to style this that would be kind of preppy Okay so, This next thing is, like, super random but I just like had- I don't know why it just, like, it called me, like, it called to me, like, I needed it. It's just this Trader Joe's shirt But it's like olive green, which is like literally the best color and it's just so cute, like, I don't know I just like really wanted it. It's so random, but I just wanted it so bad I don't like I mean it's a little bit old. It's not very soft, but it's great. I think it's freaking awesome I'm totally pumped about it like I don't know why but yeah trader Joe's shirt great color fits pretty good Probably will wear it to bed The last sort of clothing item I got is a little bit weird, but this also reminds me something from Brandy it's just this kind of like mock neck sort of really big long sleeve top and It's huge like it's pretty big and it's from Gap and it's just this really it's honestly so cozy And I just love how the neck looks And I feel like if I like rolled the sleeves and tied it in the front it would literally look Just like something from Brandy I was pretty excited about this it was definitely something I was a little bit iffy about but I'm totally glad I got it I think it's really cool and the price is just too good to give up the last things I got was to the last things I got were to [bail] so the first belt. I got was just this like gold or even a heisman It's kind of like Golden Brown belt the only problem Is that this has like a little? I don't know if you can see this but I think this felt was literally two bucks So I'm not too mad about it and also I think I'm just going to fix it so it's not a big deal But it's just a really cool belt the quality of it is really really good.
